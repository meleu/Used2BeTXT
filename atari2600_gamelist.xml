The 2003 Holiday GreetingCart was part of a promotion in the AtariAge Store during the 2003 holiday sale. The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!

Atari 2600 fans Chris Walton (cd-w), Fred Quimby (batari), Bob Montgomery (vdub_bobby), and Zach Matley (Zach) submitted several 1K entries for the 2005 Minigame Competition. They have now teamed up to release their seven 1K games in a single 2005 Minigame Multicart, complete with an on-screen menu that allows easy selection of the games as well as instructions.

The included games are:

 - Hunchy - Hunchy is inspired by the classic arcade game Hunch Back (released 1982), which is loosely based on the novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1831) by Victor Hugo. You play the role of the hunchbacked bell-ringer Quasimodo in his quest to rescue the gypsy girl Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. To succeed, you must jump across the roof of the Notre Dame, avoiding the guards and an assortment of missiles. There are 16 screens to complete, increasing in difficulty as you progress. Hunchy has an infinite number of lives, and you will need them all!

 - Jetman - In Jetman you play a battle-hardened gas station attendant in outer space! Your job is to refuel the rockets as quickly as possible, while coming under heavy fire from forces unknown. Jetman is inspired by the classic Ultimate 8-bit game JetPac (released 1983). There are 16 space craft to refuel in increasingly hostile conditions.

 - Nightrider - As the Nightrider, you must ride for freedom or die! Hostile government forces are in helicopter pursuit as you make your futile bid for freedom. To stop or hesitate will mean certain death, but the rugged terrain will also bite you without warning. The faster and further you ride, the more your freedom is worth.

 - Zirconium - An exotic alien species is invading our galaxy! The cubic zirconia, based on elemental zirconium instead of carbon, have tried to block your approach to their boxy mothership with their geometrically perfect space mines. You, as the intrepid space captain Joe Diamond, must think outside the box as you battle your way through their blocky blockade. Your ship's armor can only withstand a few collisions, so take good aim at the obstacles and don't miss the power packs spread throughout the galaxy!

 - Rocket Command - Interterrestrial beings are erupting from the earth's core in an attempt to take over the surface! As the Rocket Commander, you have installed a battalion of rockets at the top of the volcanic crater where the magma beings are launching their craft. It's up to you to destroy these molten enemies before they launch into the sky! If your rockets destroy enough invaders, your leader will allow you to install more rockets to continue your campaign. You must be on your toes, because there's not much time to aim when you are down to your last few rockets!

 - M-4 - Back in 1977, Midway released an arcade game titled M-4. This is a pretty simple game, where you take control of a tank where your goal is to accumulate as many points as you can within a 90 second period of time. You can score points for hitting the wall (well, you only get one point for this), hitting an opposing tank, hitting a car, and hitting an airplane (which scores the most). Every time you or hte other tank gets hit, the walls are rebuilt and the tanks are retgurned to their starting positions. The timer then pauses for a moment, and the game then resumes.

 - Marble Jumper - Marble Jumper is a classic puzzle game played on a board with 33 squares. The goal is to clear the board with the last marble in the center. Marbles move by jumping horizontally or vertically. As in checkers, the jump is valid if the adjacent position is occupied and the position two squares away is clear. During a jump, the adjacent marble is removed from the board. Diagonal jumps are not allowed. Marble Jumper contains 24 puzzles, including the original where all squares but the center are filled.

The 2005 Minigame Multicart can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4 - 4 grids stacked vertically on top of each other; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3 - 3 board. The game can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.

3-D Tic-Tac-Toe was written by Carol Shaw, who went on to greater fame as the creator of Activision's River Raid.

In Acid Drop you had multi-coloured blocks which were comprised of three squares that had to be matched in colour sequence. The blocks could only be laid vertically and you had to work out the best possible sequence that would help you to get ahead in the game for by pressing the fire button you could make the blocks change their stacking. Three blocks of the same colour laid together in a row would award you points and clear the space that they occupied. From time to time an Acid Drop would make an appearance and strategic use of it could allow the player to clear certain problem blocks from the screen and generally make life easier. On the downside the graphics were minimal and game play was far less intense than it could have been. The biggest problem though came from the horrendous music that was played as you attempted to sort out the falling blocks for the 2600 was not designed with music in mind.

It was best played with the sound turned well down but anyone expecting to find a true Tetris clone would have been sadly disappointed.

Adventures of TRON was based on the Walt Disney motion picture TRON, and was programmed by APh for Mattel. Originally it was meant to be an Atari 2600 version of the Intellivision game TRON Maze-A-Tron, but by the time the game was completed it had changed so much that Mattel gave it a different title. As a result of that change, APh also created Adventures of TRON for the Intellivision, but Mattel decided not to release it. In addition to being sold separately, Adventures of TRON was also packaged with TRON: Deadly Discs and a special blue TRON joystick. Consumers who bought the games separately could also send in proof of purchase and get a free joystick.

Adventure is considered the first action-adventure game. Its creator, Warren Robinett, also introduced the first widely known Easter egg to the gaming world.

History and Design:

Adventure was published by the console's developer, Atari, Inc. It was inspired by a computer text game, Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and later modified by Don Woods.

Despite discouragement from his boss at Atari who said it could not be done, game designer Warren Robinett created a graphic game loosely based on the text game. Atari's Adventure went on to sell a million copies.

At the time of the game's creation Atari did not credit any of its authors for their work. Robinett included a hidden message in the game identifying himself as the creator, thus creating one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game. According to Warren, a young player from Salt Lake City, Utah first discovered the easter egg and wrote in to Atari regarding it.

The total memory used by the game program was 4096 bytes (4 KB) for the game code (in ROM) and 128 bytes for program variables (in RAM). The Atari 2600's CPU was a 1.19 megahertz 8-bit MOS Technology 6507, which was a cheaper version of the 6502.

Due to a limitation in the Atari 2600's hardware, the left and right sides of nearly every screen are mirror images of each other, which fostered the creation of the game's confusing mazes. The notable exceptions are two screens in the black castle catacombs and two in the main hallway beneath the Gold Castle. These two hallway screens are mirrored, but contain a vertical "wall" object in the room in order to achieve a non-symmetrical shape, as well as act as a secret door for an Easter egg.

Innovation:

Not only was Adventure the first action-adventure game on a video console and the first to include an Easter egg, it was also the first ever to allow a player to have a stash of items, but required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands.

Easter Egg:

Inside the black castle catacombs (on difficulty level 2 or 3), embedded in the south wall of a sealed chamber (accessible only with the bridge), is an "invisible" 1-pixel object referred to as the grey dot. One must "bounce" the player cursor along the bottom wall to "grab" the dot. The dot is not actually invisible, but simply the same color as the wall and is easily seen when placed in a catacombs passage or over a normal wall. The dot is not attracted to the magnet, unlike most other objects in Adventure.

Bringing this dot to the east end of the corridor below the golden castle while other differently-colored objects are present causes the wall object to also become 'invisible', allowing the player to pass into a room displaying the words "Created by Warren Robinett".

Additionally, this could create a problem for the player. If the bat happened to steal one of the items necessary to cause the wall to become invisible (and drop a dragon which would wander off, for example) the player would become trapped in the wall unless the bat happened by again with an item that would cause the wall to re-open.

Gameplay:

The player's goal is simply to find the enchanted chalice and return it to the gold castle. The player character, represented by a square, explores a multi-screen landscape containing castles, mazes, and various rooms. Hidden throughout the world are a sword, keys to unlock each of the three castles (gold, black, and white), a magic bridge which allows the player to travel through a wall, and a magnet which will pull any of these objects toward it.

Roaming the world are three dragons:

- Yorgle, the yellow dragon: He is afraid of the golden key and will run away from it. He guards the chalice when he can find it; otherwise he wanders around or helps the other dragons guard their possessions.

- Grundle, the green dragon: He guards the magnet, the bridge, the black key, and the chalice.

- Rhindle, the red dragon: He is the fastest of the three and the most aggressive. He guards the white key and chalice.

A dragon can be "killed" by touching it with the sword. If the console's right difficulty switch is in the "A" position, the dragons will run away when they see the sword.

When a dragon touches the player, it will "strike" (remaining motionless for a moment with its mouth open, waiting for a shorter time if the console's left difficulty switch is in the "A" position) and then "swallow" the player, who becomes trapped in the dragon's belly. While the dragon's mouth is opened, it cannot be killed.

A black bat flies around randomly, occasionally picking up or dropping objects (including live or dead dragons). The bat can steal the player's sword and give him a live dragon in return, or vice-versa. The player can catch the bat and carry it around. The bat continues to fly even after the player has been killed, and occasionally the bat will pick up the dragon whose stomach contains the player, giving the player a whirlwind tour of the Adventure universe. The player can trap the bat inside a castle; this works best with the gold castle, since it has only one room and (provided the player has emptied it beforehand) the bat will, if it is flying upwards (straight up or diagonally up-right or up-left), fly around endlessly in the room and will not leave the castle. If the player enters with another item, the bat will change direction to grab the new item and usually end up leaving the castle. The bat's name was intended to be Knubberrub, but that name never made it into the manual.

There are three different games available via the Game Select switch:

- Game 1 is a simplified version of the game and does not have the red dragon, the bat, the catacombs, the white castle, or the maze inside the black castle.

- Game 2 is the full version, having all the features described. The location of the objects at the start of a new game is always the same and because of this known initial state, this is the easiest game to use to find the Easter egg.

- Game 3 is just like Game 2; however, the initial locations of the objects are pseudo-randomized, providing a different game each time. Because of this, the game could be easier or harder to solve (occasionally impossible, due to a bug in the item-placement routine that sometimes locks the gold key inside the gold castle). Due to the unpredictable placement of the items, it is more difficult to secure the bat and locate the items needed to find the Easter egg (though the location of the dot is consistent).

When a player is eaten by a dragon, he does not necessarily have to start over. Hitting the "Game Reset" switch resurrects the player back at the gold castle and resurrects any killed dragons; however, the objects all remain where they were at the time of the player's death. This could be thought of as one of the earliest usages of the "continue game" feature, which is now prevalent in most video games. Hitting "Game Select" after death returns the game to the game select screen and an entirely new game can be played.

Each game version is played the same. The only difference is the number of matrix squares. Behind each numbered square is an object. Each player takes a turn by choosing two matrix squares. When a player chooses a square, an object is revealed. If the two squares' objects are identical, the player scores one point.

You're trapped! Your disabled nuclear submarine, resting periously on an undersea ledge, has begun taking on water. With time running out for you and your crew -- and with your on-board torpedos shaken loose by an eerie current from deep under the sea floor -- it's up to you alone whether you sink or swim!

Here are some things that you need to remember:

1. The torpedos cannot enter the elevator shaft, so once you have retrieved your keys and the door opens, move at once into the elevator and you'll be out of danger's reach.

2. Try positioning your player so that he can jump a barrier and torpedo at the same time -- it can save you precious seconds, and the time you save at one level may help you out on the next.

3. In games 3 &amp; 4, you have ten Airlock Levels to pass through. The first five levels, like those in games 1 &amp; 2, have two barriers per level. But the second five levels in games 3 &amp; 4 have four barriers per level. Not an easy task!

Air Raid, not to be confused with Air Raiders or River Raid, is considered to be the rarest game released for the Atari 2600. It was the only game released by MenAvision and had an extremely limited distribuition. Its cartridge is a blue T-handle design with a picture of flying saucers attacking a futuristic city. It is not uncommon for the game to sell in the thousands of dollars when listed on eBay.

We have never seen the box for this game.

Air-Sea Battle was one of the nine original launch titles for the Atari 2600 when it was released in October 1977. It was also released by Sears as Target Fun and was the pack-in game with the original Sears Tele-Games version of the Atari 2600.

Gameplay:

There are six basic types of game available in Air-Sea Battle, and for each type, there are one or two groups of three games, for a total of twenty-seven game variants. Within each group, variant one is the standard game, variant two features guided missiles which can be directed left or right after being fired, and variant three pits a single player (using the right gun) against a computer opponent, which simply fires continuously at the default angle or speed. In every game, players shoot targets (enemy planes or ships, shooting gallery targets, or each other, depending on the game chosen) competing to get a higher score. Each round lasts two minutes and sixteen seconds; the player with the higher score after time expires is the winner, unless one player wins (and ends the game) by reaching 99 points before the time is up.


Anti-aircraft games

Variants 1-6 are anti-aircraft games, in which the player uses a stationary anti-aircraft gun that can be positioned at a 30, 60, or 90-degree angle to shoot down four different types of aircraft. The planes typically appear in groups of three to five, and once every plane in a formation has been destroyed, a new formation appears. There are two groups of anti-aircraft games: in variants 1-3, each target hit is worth 1 point, while in 4-6, the various types of aircraft have different point values. Additionally, zero-point blimps are added as obstacles in games 4-6.


Torpedo games

The torpedo games (7-12) are essentially the same as the anti-aircraft games, except that each player mans a submarine and fires at ships instead of planes. As with the anti-aircraft games, in games 7-9, all targets are worth one point, while games 10-12 have variable point values for targets and additional zero-point obstacles, this time in the form of mines.


Shooting gallery games

The shooting gallery games (13-15) differ from the previous variants in that, in addition to setting the gun angle, the player can move the gun left and right. Instead of planes or ships, clowns, ducks, and rabbits are the targets, with point values of 1, 2, and 3 respectively.


Polaris games

The polaris games (16-18) put the player in control of a boat which moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen automatically. Instead of controlling the gun angle, the player controls the speed at which the ship moves, attempting to shoot the same fleets of planes as in the anti-aircraft variants, with the point values of games 4-6.


Bomber games

In the bomber games (19-21), the player-controlled vehicle is a plane flying near the top of the screen dropping bombs on the ships from the torpedo games. As in the polaris games, the plane's speed is controlled by the player, and the point values are identical to those in games 10-12.


Polaris vs. Bomber games

In the polaris vs. bomber games (22-27), one player controls the ship from the polaris games while the other controls the plane from the bomber games, with the goal being to destroy the other player's craft. Games 25-27 feature zero-point mines as obstacles.

Based on the really bad 50's sci-fi movie of the same name, Alligator People was the center of controversy even before the actual game was found.  Sometime is in the mid 90's a collector found what they thought was a prototype for the Alligator People because the cartridge was labeled as such.  For many years most people assumed that the game was the lost Alligator People prototype, mostly because the games graphics were rather generic looking and there was no other indication of its true identity.  However in 2002 when collector Ben Liashenko found a genuine copy of Alligator people, it was discovered that the game everyone previously thought was Alligator people was actually Planet of the Apes!

Despite being based off one of the worst horror/sci-fi movies ever created, Alligator People is actually a really good game.   You play the role of Jane Marvin who must save her husband and his friends who are turning into Alligator People due to a failed medical treatment (think The Lizard from Spiderman).  Jane (who just happens to look like a syringe) must shoot each person on the top and bottom of the screen with special Alligator antidote (no I'm not making this up!) until they are cured.  Of course the alligators aren't just going to let Jane wander about curing people unmolested, otherwise it wouldn't be much of a game now would it?  Jane must avoid roving alligators and moving walls whiles collecting vials of antidote and serum.  

So what do moving walls have to do with the movie?  Well to be honest not much, but it wouldn't be much of a game without them (play game variation 1 and see).  The constantly moving maze walls pulse in and out in a predetermined pattern attempting to crush poor Jane.  After playing the game for awhile it quickly becomes clear that these moving walls turn an average game into a great game.  The walls also serve another important function by covering up antidote vials your trying to collect making your task all the more difficult (this can be turned off with the right difficulty switch).  However if you find the moving walls too difficult they can be turned off by selecting games 1, 4, or 7.  Likewise you can make it so Jane can safely travel through the walls by selecting options 2, 5, or 8.

As you wander about the maze you'll see little vials of antidote and large red S's which are containers of serum.  Antidote vials allow Jane to cure her friends by shooting them with them with it.  The number of antidote vials Jane currently holds is represented by the 'A' at the bottom of the screen while the 'S' represents the current Serum Level.  Serum appears only in game variations with moving walls (all but 1, 4, and 7), and increase the potency of the antidote (thus making it easier to cure people).  The Serum Level can be increased to a maximum of nine, after which collecting more does nothing.  Jane can also shoot regular alligators in addition to her friends to prevent them from killing her.  Shooting regular alligators doesn't cost any antidote vials (there's no curing them, they really are alligators!), so shoot till your hearts content.  Once Jane has cured all six of her friends the game moves to the next level.

Unlike most 2600 games, Alligator People offers the player a unique gameplay option: Infinite Lives.  Yes you read that right, by putting the left difficulty switch in the 'B' position you can give yourself infinite lives.  It's unknown if this option would have been left in the final game, but apparently 20th Century Fox's management wasn't too keen on this.  According to Crypts of Chaos programmer John Marvin:

"The developer had left a switch in, you know for one of the switches on the back of the VCS, for unlimited lives, and management was pretty irritated."

While the management may not have liked this feature (what do they know?), it does make a great learning tool.  The player can really get the feel of the game without worrying about how many times he's died.  Still it does take alot of the challenge out of the game...

So why did Alligator People never get released?  According to John Marvin:

"Nobody seemed to be interested... we would play test games and sometimes they wouldn't make it out because of the play test and that one didn't make it out because it was a little bit too slow moving for the kids that played it, too easy for them."

I don't know what version of the game these kids were playing, but Alligator People isn't easy by any stretch of the imagination.  Perhaps they were playing the variations without the moving maze?

As in Pac-Man, the player is opposed by enemies who kill on contact. The enemies increase in number as the player advances from one level to the next, but do not increase in speed. Their speed is always matched exactly to that of the player.

On odd numbered levels, the player controls an ape (in some versions labeled "Copier"), and must collect coconuts while avoiding headhunters (labeled "Police" and "Thief"). On even numbered levels, the player controls a paint roller (labeled "Rustler"), and must paint over each spot of the board while avoiding pigs (labeled "Cattle" and "Thief"). Each level is followed by a short bonus stage.

Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is colored in, and in the even levels, bonus points are awarded. This leads to some comparisons with the popular and influential Qix, although the similarities between these games are superficial at best. When the player clears all four corners of the board, he is briefly empowered to kill the enemies by touching them (just as when Pac-Man uses a "power pill").

The game controls consist of a joystick and a single button labeled "Jump," which can be used up to three times per level. Pressing the jump button does not cause the player to jump, but causes the enemies to jump, enabling the player to walk under them.

Enemy Movement:

The enemies (and bonus stage pigs) in Amidar move deterministically; this is described in the game as "Amidar movement". Each normal-type enemy moves vertically from the top to the bottom of the screen, and then back to the top, and so on. While moving in a constant vertical direction, the enemy will take every horizontal turn available. Each level has one special enemy (the "Tracer", colored white) which, at the beginning of each stage, simply patrols around the perimeter of the gameboard in an anti-clockwise direction. However, following a certain number of "laps", The Tracer will begin to relentlessly pursue the player by following the path their on-screen avatar takes around the level. Since the Tracer moves at the same speed as the player character, but does not mimic any pauses or hesitations the player makes, gameplay now becomes much more frantic, as too many mistakes will allow the Tracer to catch up. 

Later levels increase difficulty by adding more complex game grids, adding more enemies, and reducing the delay before the Tracer starts pursuing the player, until eventually it starts its pursuit at the very beginning of each new level.

The even numbered levels where the player controls a paint roller are somewhat more difficult, because the paint roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines which are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. In practical terms, this means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level (which always has a fresh supply of paint) and spread outwards, rather than completing squares in any part of the game board they please, as they can on the odd-numbered levels. This also makes filling the corner rectangles and becoming invincible much more difficult.

Ports and Clones:

A simplified version of Amidar was released in 1983 for the Atari 2600 by Parker Brothers. This was the only official port but as with most arcade games of the time, there were many unofficial clones for home computers including Acornsoft's Crazy Tracer (BBC Micro, Acorn Electron), Microdeal's Cuthbert Goes Walkabout (Dragon 32/64, TRS-80 CoCo, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family), Llamasoft's Traxx (Vic-20, ZX Spectrum), Superior Software's Crazy Painter (BBC Micro, Acorn Electron) and Gapper (DOS).

Fans of Amiga computers will immediately recognize the nature of the Amiga Boing Demo 2.0. To help demonstrate the power of the Amiga, the Amiga Boing Ball demo was created. The demo consists of a checkered red and white ball bouncing within the confines of the screen, changing direction when hitting the walls, all the while spinning. With this demo running in the background (as the Amiga could multitask, which was a fairly unique feature at the time in personal computers), it as a powerful statement of the Amiga's capabilities. This demo ultimately became synonymous with the Amiga, and even today it used as part of the official Amiga identity.

For a period of time the Amiga Boing Demo was ported to just about every platform imaginable to demonstrate that, "Hey, we can do this, too!" And of course, the Atari 2600 was no exception! Several years ago, Rob Kudla created a simple version of the Amiga Boing Demo for the Atari 2600 as a tech demo that he posted to the Stella programmers mailing list.

More recently, David Galloway (djmips in our forums), updated Rob's demo to make it truer to the original Amiga demo. His changes include:

- The ball is now larger

- The world the ball bounces in now has gravity (as opposed to the ball moving at a constant velocity and in a straight line)

- The spin of the ball switches when it bounces against a side wall

- PAL/NTSC switch using the B&amp;W switch

- Corrected the number of scanlines to 262

- User control of horizontal speed and gravity (wtih joystick)

- Random change of horizontal speed (after bounce with side wall) 

Includes cartridge and manual. If you're not attending the Dallas vgXpo, you can pre-order the Amiga Boing Demo 2.0 in our store, and it'll be shipped to you after the show.

    <name>Androman on the Moon</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Androman on the Moon was one of several planned games for the unreleased Androman robot.  Although a few of the games were rumored to have been programmed, Androman on the Moon is the first one to actually surface.  Although the game itself may not look like much, one has to remember that it was only part of the package.  The real magic was with Androman himself.

So what exactly was Androman?  Androman was a small white robot that would scurry about on a floor mat while the player controlled him using the Atari 2600.  Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was.  Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games.  One of those games being Androman on the Moon. 

So exactly what is Androman doing on the moon?  According to programmer Michael Case, Androman is mining minerals on the moon when he is attacked by aliens (don't you hate it when that happens?).  The giant floor mat would have the locations of the mines, and the player would have to guide Androman to them.  Once Androman was over a mine, the 2600 would show the mine maze portion of the game.  In the mine maze the player has to guide Androman (shown as an X) through the maze while avoiding the alien (shown as a green face). 

Androman isn't helpless however.  Unbeknownst to the aliens, Androman comes equipped with time bombs that he can drop behind him.  If timed right, the alien will be destroyed if it is near the bomb when it explodes.  However the aliens are very fast, and timing everything just right is difficult.  The best course of action is to hightail it towards the end of the mine before the alien can get you.  If the alien does catch Androman the screen will go black and the timer will countdown to zero, after this the game crashes.  The reason for this is that the 2600 is trying to output commands to Androman that would make him jerk around and make noise (to show that he has been hit).  Unfortunately there is no Androman robot to control so the game simply crashes. 

Once the player has made it through the mine, he enters a 3-D tunnel.  Here the player must avoid or shoot down large circular objects (Moon Bats) as they come flying towards the screen.  The tunnel will move about the screen as the player shifts to the left or right in some very nice looking 3-D effects.  As with the mine screen, if the player gets hit the game crashes. 

After the player reaches the end of the tunnel, he would have had to make Androman move back to his home base with the minerals he mined.  After which the whole cycle would start again (find a new mine and play the mine scene again).  Unfortunately we don't have an Androman to control, so the game simply crashes at the end of the tunnel.  Oh well. 

Androman on the Moon is an interesting game that shows how the 2600 could be expanded and enhanced through the use of sophisticated controllers (such as robots).  Unfortunately the game market was rapidly deteriorating, and the public wasn't very receptive to new ideas, especially anything that cost extra money.  The Androman idea wouldn't be seen again until Nintendo decided to try something similar with R.O.B.  Unfortunately R.O.B. met a similar fate after only two games.

Hello all. I am pleased to announce that I have finished my first sequel to K.O. Cruiser! Woot!

If case you are not familiar with the show, the Angry Video Game Nerd is an Internet show based on reviewing old video games. The "nerd" is a retro gamer like us and, like us, has been aggravated playing terrible games. Often, in the past, we would buy a game (or most likely get one as a gift) only to find out it was TERRIBLE!

"Back to the Future for my Nintendo? Thanks Santa! This looks great!"

(10 minutes later)

"This sucks!"

The show combines knowledge of video games &amp; old systems with rants so acerbic and scatological that they can cause paint to peel. In quite a few episodes, characters from the game, such as the Joker, Cowardly Lion, Bugs Bunny, etc... join in. Mike Matei, who acts in these roles, and creates the episode title art, was kind enough to draw a cover for this game. He also was helpful by giving me tips and suggestions during development.

Enjoy!

P.S. In this sequel, I added I added the ability to dodge punches. When your opponent is about to throw a punch, you can move left or right and dodge. If your boxer is not in danger, you will move normally. I'll update my other boxing game to use this feature.

    <desc>
Aquaventure is a bit of a mystery in the prototype world. It was never mentioned in any Atari press releases nor does it show up on any internal part lists.  Aquaventure seems to have popped out of the woodwork one day without any public fanfare nor any history behind its mysterious origins.  In any case, Aquaventure seems to be complete and ready for release, we can only speculate as to why it was shelved.

The game concept is simple; you must dive to the bottom of an undersea cavern and retrieve a fabulous treasure (which just happens to look like a small house of some sort).  Along the way you must avoid fish, sea horses, and other underwater creatures attempting to block your path.  Your diver came prepared however, for he is armed with a spear gun which he can use to temporarily kill one of the creatures.  However, each enemy you kill is soon replaced by a faster and indestructible version of itself, so you need to carefully carve a path to the bottom only destroying the creatures that get in your way.  After retrieving the treasure and returning it to the top of the cavern, a mermaid will appear.  Touching the mermaid will take you to the next level, where you get to do it all over again.  At the top of the screen there is a turtle, which shows how much air you have left. If the turtle reaches the Air sign at the far end of the screen before you complete the level you loose a life. 

Aquaventure's main problem lies in its repetitive gameplay.  Each new level looks the same as the previous one, only with slightly different colors, faster fish and less time (air) to accomplish your goal.  But even with these new twists, there just isn't enough to keep the average person interested for very long.  Going up and down the same cavern all day gets old fast.  In its current state Aquaventure is a fine start, but it needs a few more gameplay elements to round it out a bit.  Why Aquaventure was abandoned instead of being fixed is still a mystery, but it's a shame since it's an interesting game with real potential.

Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability. Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The field of battle occupies a region greater than the size of the screen. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command. The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural barriers. There is also a single-player mode that allows a player to battle a computer-controlled opponent.

Artillery Duel takes gameplay common to many games of the time and adapts it to the limitations of the Atari 2600. The game consists of dueling cannons on either side of a hill or mountain of varying height and shape. Each player has control of the incline and force behind the shell launched, the objective being to score a direct hit on the opposing target. Artillery Duel lacks the wind variable featured in other variations on the theme. Where many versions gave the player a few tries on the same course, Artillery Duel switches to a new mountain after each turn. When the player does manage to hit the opposing cannon, the reward is a brief animation of comically marching soldiers at the bottom of the screen.

AStar is a new puzzle game for the Atari 2600 by Aaron Curtis, whose first homebrew endeavor was the highly popular Fall Down. AStar is inspired by an old calculator game called DStar. The basic idea is to collect all the items (cherries on the first level), but it's not as easy as it may seem at first! You can only move in a straight line until you hit something. You can then change your direction and again move forward until you hit a wall. You also have control of a small block to that you can use to help you navigate the level.

The number of moves you've made is shown at the bottom of the screen. Each level has a minimum number of moves required to complete it, and if you go over this the display will change color. Completing every level in the minimum number of moves (no easy task!) wins the game!

AStar may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, almost entirely... There is one Gaulish village, located near the Roman outposts of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum, and Compendium, that has resisted the Roman legions. According to reports from Roman spies, the villagers are led by two Gaulish heroes - Asterix and Obelix. 

The first hero, Asterix, is a shrewd little warrior with a quick mind and a large moustache. Asterix gets his superhuman strength from a magic potion brewed by the village Druid, Getafix. 

The other hero is Asterix's remarkably strong and hungry friend, Obelix. Obelix has a healthy appetite for wild boar, and is always ready for a good fight with the Romans. 

These two valiant heroes aren't afraid of anything. Except... well, except for one thing. The off-key tunes from the lyre of Cacofonix, the village bard, can make them retreat faster than a Roman can say "Veni, Vidi, Vici"! 

Trivia:

Taz for the 2600 was slightly modified and sold as Asterix in Europe.

The objective of Asteroids is to score as many points as possible by destroying asteroids and flying saucers. The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved  the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).

Each stage starts with a few asteroids drifting in random directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges  for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that frequently move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids also score higher points. Periodically, a flying saucer appears on one side of the screen and moves across to the other before disappearing again. The saucers are of two kinds: Large saucers fire in random directions, while small saucers aim at the player's ship.

Hit as many falling, fast-moving targets as you can. Move your laser base to avoid being hit yourself. Keep shooting as long as your bases last, and try for a great Peak Score! 

You start with 10 laser defense bases. Several things fall from the sky: rocks, spinning white bombs, "smart" guided missiles and - when your score goes over 20,000 - UFO bombs. If your active laser is hit OR a spinner lands, you lose that base. You get another base whenever your peak score goes up 1,000 points. As the score goes higher more targets appear - falling faster. 

~From the Manual

This is the Atari version of the Intellivision game Astrosmash. There is a bug in the original release of this cartridge - when two controllers are plugged in and moved simultaneously, unpredictable graphic effects can occur, and the joysticks may stop operating until the game is reset. The bug was fixed in later productions of the game.

If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed.  At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished.  The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.

This is a special contest version of Atlantis. It was sent to the high scorers of the Defend Atlantis contest so that they could determine the top four scorers. The top four players from Atlantis II would be flown to Bermuda for an Atlantis shoot-out and a chance to win $10,000. While the game graphics are the same, it is much faster and fewer points are awarded for hits, making the game much more challenging. The actual scoring graphics are slightly different as well.

TRAINER VERSION: INVINCIBLE SIDE GUNS

Atlantis is a variation on the shooting game genre popular in the early 1980s. The player controls the last defenses of the City of Atlantis against the Gorgon invaders. The city has seven bases, which are vulnerable to attack. Three of these have firepower capabilities to destroy the Gorgon ships before they manage to drop bombs on one of the settlements. The gun bases have fixed cannons; the center base fires straight up, while the far left and far right bases fire diagonally upwards across the screen. The enemy ships pass back and forth from left to right four times before they enter bombing range, giving an ample opportunity to blow them away. Lost bases can be regained by destroying enough Gorgon ships. However, regardless of the player's efforts to avert the tragedy, Atlantis is doomed. The only way the game can end is when all bases are destroyed. However, then a tiny ship rises from the rubble and speeds away, foreshadowing the events of the sequel Cosmic Ark.

Similar Games: 

The most obvious comparison to this game is with Colony 7 which was released by Taito in a way a combination of Space Invaders and Missile Command, which also features the defense of a number of bases, only some armed, against an irresistible invading force. The principal differences lie in the controls. While Missile Command features a complex targeting and positioning system that used a trackball in the arcades, Atlantis returns to an earlier era where the only control is in the timing of the gun fire that must be lined up with the movement of the enemy ships in order to successfully destroy the invaders. Still, like many of the early titles produced by Imagic, the game was popular and considered a hit for the company.

1475. Tenochtitl?n is ruled by the Aztec sovereign Axayacatl, son of Motecuhzoma. Even as he was being defeated by the Tarascans, Axayacatl was expanding his realm by conquering the Mixtecs and Zapotecs.

You, being a warrior of the Zapotecs, managed to escape the battlefield together with two of your brothers, but unfortunately your party was trapped afterwards. Axayacatl offers you the only chance to survive by reaching the coast and leaving the country by boat. He challenges you with spear throwing warriors along your path and stone rolling priests on the pyramids. Reaching the pyramids safe inside allows your team to relax for a short time and prepare for the next trail.

Simon Quernhorst, author of the Atari 2600 homebrew game Mental Kombat, has programmed a new 2600 game: A-VCS-tec Challenge. A-VCS-tec Challenge is a conversion of the popular Aztec Challenge on the Commodore 64. The Atari 2600 version of the game includes the original game's arcade-like first level, called "The Gauntlet", as well as a second level where you must race up the stairs to the top of the pyramid while avoiding large stones being thrown down from the top! A-VCS-tec Challenge features the memorable soundtrack from the Commodore 64 version, composed by Paul Slocum, author of the Synthcart and Marble Craze for the 2600.

You can learn more about A-VCS-tec Challenge by visiting Simon Quernhorst's A-VCS-tec Challenge Development Page. You can read about the game's development, view detailed information about the gameplay, and watch a 43 second video trailer.

A-VCS-tec Challenge may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

The object of the game is to use your paddle control to line up the Spanish Fly with the flying bachelor, giving him a shot of energy and causing him to rebound, and "scoring" with one of the lovely young ladies attending his party. When the game starts, the bachelor has four lives. Every time he misses the Spanish Fly he loses one life and a musical theme is played. After each life is lost, you must depress the button again. When all the lives are lost the game is over. Small squares on the stripe at the bottom of the screen show how many lives are remaining in addition to the one then in play.

Backfire is a homebrew game for the Atari 2600 written by Chad Lare. In Backfire you have two guns, one on the top of the screen and one on the bottom. To control the gun on the top of the screen, press up, to switch to the other gun, press down. Once you are controlling a gun, you can move horizontally and shoot. If you have a clear shot all the way across the screen, you can accidentally blow up your own gun. Also if you shoot one of the barriers, your shot is reflected back at you and you have to get out of the way (hence the name Backfire).

Scoring: There are four types of targets. The spaceships are worth 10 points if you shoot them when they are on one of the center lines, 0 points if they are on a line right next to your gun, or 5 points anywhere else on the screen. There are also red, blue, and green UFOs. The red ones are worth 100 points, the blue ones give you an extra life, and the green ones clear out all of the barriers and set you back to an easier level where you have more clear shots. If you don't shoot any green UFOs for a while, the levels get ridiculously hard.

How to win: You can't! This is Atari. You play till you lose. Them's the rules! Difficulty switches, select switch, and BW/Color switch have no effect. Only the 1st joystick is used.

Backfire may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store. The label design created by Earl Green for Backfire was chosen through the Backfire Label Contest. Dale Crum then created a full-color 12-page manual to accompany the game, in the same style as manuals that accompanied Atari's picture-label games.

Backgammon, in some version, has been played in various parts of the world for over 5,000 years.  It is possibly the oldest war game still being played.  It is suggested in early writings that the game was originally designed to train soldiers for combat, as backgammon has all the intricacies of any war game: strategy, position, and timing.  It is both a game of skill and luck, which probably accounts for its longevity.

The most ancient possible ancestor to be found so far dates back to the ancient civilization of Sumer.  The Egyptian Pharaohs played a similar game.  Game boards were found during the excavations of Kin Tut's tomb that akin to backgammon.  The ancient Greeks and Romans played different forms of the game were mentioned in many of their writings.  A form of backgammon was played in the Middle East long the Crusades.  In fact, it is believed that the Crusaders brought the game back to Britain with them, where it flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries.

The earliest written mention of the name "backgammon" was made in 1645, in a description of a game that is very much like backgammon as it is played today.  The rules of today's  game were set down by Edmond Hoyle in 1743.

The object of all the variations of the game, from its beginnings to now, is to move you game pieces around the board and bear them off before your opponent does.

Each level in Bank Heist is a maze-like city (similar to Pac-Man). The objective of the game is to rob as many banks as possible while avoiding the police. The player controls a car called the Getaway Car. The car has a limited amount of fuel, which can be refilled by changing cities. Robbing a bank will cause a cop car to appear, as well as another bank. Up to three cars can be present in a city at a time. Cars can be destroyed by dropping dynamite out the tail pipe of the Getaway Car (however, dynamite can also destroy the Getaway Car). The player starts out with four spare cars (lives). Lives are lost by running out of fuel, being hit by dynamite, or hitting a cop car. If the player can rob nine banks in one city, an extra car is earned.

The left and right difficulty switches alter how hard the game is. When the left difficulty switch is set to A, the cop cars are smarter in catching the Getaway Car; when it's set to B, enemy cars move in a more set pattern. When the right difficulty switch is set to A, the banks appear in random spots; when the switch is set to B, the banks appear in preset locations

The player must pilot a biplane through a series of barns in the shortest time possible while dodging windmills, weather vanes, and geese. Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time.

There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is Hedge Hopper (10 barns), game 2 is Crop Duster (15 barns), game 3 is Stunt Pilot (15 barns), and game 4 is Flying Ace (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.

Originally, a player with a time or better of 33.3 seconds on game 1, 51.0 seconds on game 2, or 54.0 seconds on game 3 could send Activision a picture of their screen and receive membership in the Activision Flying Aces and receive a Flying Aces patch.

Basic Math was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in October 1977.

The player's objective is simple: solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number).

The player uses the joystick to enter a guess, with sound effects signaling whether it is right or wrong.

BASIC PROGRAMMING is an instructional tool designed to teach you the fundamental steps of computer programming. BASIC is an acronym for Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. It was originated to that people could easily learn to "write" computer programs.

Computer programs are simply a series of instructions. The programs control the flow of information within the computer. BASIC PROGRAMMING allows you to give the Video Computer System(tm) the instructions it needs to carry out some simple tasks.

Keep in mind that BASIC PROGRAMMING has a limited amount of memory in comparison to more sophisticated computer systems. It is, however, an excellent instructional device for learning the essentials of computer programming.

Basketball features a simple game of one-on-one basketball, playable by one or two players.

At the start of the game, both players are at the center of the ice arena. A jump ball is thrown between them, at which point play begins. The offensive player (the one with the ball) always faces the goal he's shooting at, and the defensive player always faces his opponent. Each player can move in eight directions with the joystick; the player with the ball constantly dribbles it. The defensive player may steal the ball when it leaves the opponents hands (either in mid-dribble or mid-shot).

After either player scores the ball, the shooter is reset to the center of the court, and the defender is set under the net to rebound the ball. The player with the highest score after 4 minutes is the winner.

Popular Culture:

In the 1980 comedy film Airplane!, flight controllers are seen playing this game rather than watching the monitor.

To play this version on a real 2600, you should use joysticks with a fire button on the grip and perhaps attach them to something. To enjoy Battlezone TC with z26, you should pass in the parameter "-j2".
 
What's New:

Control Coding has been modified to allow the use of dual joystick in controlling the tank.

Beamrider takes place above Earth's atmosphere, where a large alien shield called the Restrictor Shield surrounds the Earth. The player's objective is to clear the Shield's 99 sectors of alien craft while piloting the Beamrider ship. The Beamrider is equipped with a short-rage laser lariat and a limited supply of torpedos. The player is given three at the start of each sector.

To clear a sector, fifteen enemy ships must be destroyed. A "Sentinel ship" will then appear, which can be destroyed using a torpedo (if any remain) for bonus points. Some enemy ships can only be destroyed with torpedoes, and some must simply be dodged. Occasionally during a sector, "Yellow Rejuvenators" (extra lives) appear. They can be picked up for an extra ship, but if they are shot they will transform into ship-damaging debris.

Beamrider is considered by some as the closest you'll ever get to having Tempest on the 2600, thanks to the similar gameplay and appearance.

Activision offered special Beamrider patches to players who could get to Sector 14 with 40,000 points and sent in a screenshot of their accomplishment.

~From the Manual

Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em is a pornographic video game developed for the Atari 2600 by Mystique. It was released on October 13, 1982. Although the game sold poorly upon release, its graphic nature has earned it a cult following and much infamy. It is often referenced as one of the worst video games ever made, a distinction it shares with other Mystique titles, like Custer's Revenge.

In the animal kingdom, bees are widely known as efficient workers. But there's an interesting fact that we as humans don't know--bees enjoy having fun! Every year bees from many places gather in one spot to play in a competitive tournament of Bee-Ball! This unique insect game is a mix of tennis and volleyball where bees hit a honey ball over a net using a racquet. A bee judge watches over the match and serves new balls as needed. If the ball touches the floor or flies out of bounds, a point is scored. Avoid fouling the ball out, use your dexterity to block your opponent's shots, slam the ball to score, learn new tactics to outwit your opponent, and you could be the next Bee-Ball champion!

In the competitive sport of Bee-Ball, you must score 10 points against your opponent to win a match. You can swing at the ball to send it flying over to the net or block when your opponent is trying to get the ball past you. If the ball is about to fly over your head, you can head butt the ball in an attempt to prevent a point from being scored against you! Points are scored if the ball touches the floor or the ball flies out of bounds, but in order to score you must first successfully serve.

Bee-Ball supports single and two player play modes. In single-player mode, you compete against a challenging AI computer opponent. In two-player mode you can compete head-to-head against a friend!

This game is unplayable on an Atari 2600 without the KidVid controller and three accompanying audiotapes. The game takes cues from the tape about when to advance. The KidVid controller came with the game Smurfs Save the Day. Berenstain Bears was the only additional KidVid title Coleco released, and it was sold separately from the KidVid controller.

You can now play Berenstain Bears with the full audio thanks to the Atari 2600 z26 emulator. For more information, please visit our Kid Vid Audio Page.

Kidvid Audio Page:

In 1983, Coleco created an interesting accessory for the Atari 2600: the Kid Vid Voice Module. This accessory connects to the second controller port of the Atari 2600 and allows games to play audio from cassette tapes in sync with the action on the screen. The Kid Vid Voice Module also doubles as a portable cassette player, "portable" being relative to when it was introduced. Only two games were ever released that took advantage of the Kid Vid: Smurfs Save The Day (included with the Kid Vid) and Berenstain Bears (sold separately).

The only way to experience the Kid Vid games as Coleco intended is to use the z26 emulator with the audio files below. To use these files with z26, first make sure you have at least version 1.54 of z26 installed. Then download the audio files and place them into the same directory as z26. You can then launch Berenstain Bears and Smurfs Save the Day and experience them with the original audio. To select a tape to play, press 1, 2, or 3. To rewind a tape, press F1.

In a mysterious body of water near the Atlantic Seacost, known as the Bermuda Triangle, an unusual number of planes and ships have vanished under very bizarre circumstances. To this day the Bermuda Triangle remains an unsolved mystery... or is it? 

In your mini-sub you discover a spectacular city at the bottom of the ocean. Its machinery still churns, yet there are no signs of intelligent life. Suddenly you spot several odd looking artifacts. Could they hold the key to the Bermuda Triangle mystery? Maybe. But one thing is certain, they must be extremely valuable. But watch out! From out of nowhere, deadly laser beams rip past your vessel. Survive them and you will still have to face giant squid, man-eating sharks, explosive mines and aquatic drones, all determined to prevent you from removing these treasures.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The player controls a green stick-figure, representing a "humanoid." Using a joystick (and a firing button to activate a laser-like weapon), the player navigates a maze filled with many robots, who fire lasers back at the player character. A player can be killed by being shot, by running into a robot or an exploding robot, coming into contact by one of many electrified walls that make up the maze itself, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, "Evil Otto."

The function of Evil Otto, represented by a bouncing smiley face, is to quicken the pace of the game. Otto is unusual with regard to games of the period, in that there is no way to kill him. Otto can go through walls with impunity, and is attracted to the player character. If robots remain in the maze Otto moves slowly, about half as fast as the humanoid, but he speeds up to match the humanoid's speed once all the robots are killed. Evil Otto moves exactly the same speed as the player going left and right but he can move faster than the player going up and down; thus, no matter how close Otto is, the player can escape as long as they can avoid moving straight up or down. After 5,000 points Evil Otto doubles his speed, moving as fast as the player while robots remain in the maze, and twice as fast as the player after all the robots are destroyed.

Berzerk Voice Enhanced is an impressive hack of Atari's Berzerk that adds speech from the original arcade game. Berzerk VE has, by far, the most speech of any Atari 2600 game, with the phrases "Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!, "Chicken, Fight Like A Robot", and "Humanoid Must Not Escape" spoken during gameplay. Mike has also restored the original Arcade color scheme and reworked the artwork to more closely match the arcade original. Mike also created a high-quality label and manual for Berzerk VE, which was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo where it quickly sold out.
 
What's New:

Features speech from the arcade version of the game, as well as tweaked colors that more closely match the arcade. Also features a title screen.

Update hack of the Atari 2600 classic Space invaders.

SPACE INVADERS SYNOPSIS:

Each time you turn on SPACE INVADERS you will be at war with enemies from space who are threatening the earth. Your objective is to destroy these invaders by firing your "laser cannon." You must wipe out the invaders either before they reach the earth (bottom of the screen), or before they hit you three times with their "laser bombs."

Your long-term objective is to score as many points as possible. Points are scored each time you hit one of the SPACE INVADERS. They are worth different amounts of points, depending on their initial position on the screen. (See SCORING)

If you destroy all 36 SPACE INVADERS before they reach the earth, a new set of invaders will appear on the screen. Each time the invaders are reset on the screen they will start from a position closer to the earth until they reach the closest position possible. The SPACE INVADERS can be reset on the screen indefinitely during a game.

The Atari Mindlink was an unreleased controller for the Atari 2600. It was intended for release in 1984. The Mindlink was unique in that you had to move the muscles in your head to control the game. These movements would be read by infrared sensors and transferred as movement in the game. Games would be similar to ones that used the paddle controller, but with the Mindlink instead. Testing showed that players frequently got headaches moving their eyebrows around to play the game. Though Atari could have tried to refine the device over time, Atari simply decided to shelve the Mindlink. Two games were in development for the Mindlink by its cancellation, Bionic Breakthrough &amp; Mind Maze.

Bionic Breakthrough was basically Breakout controlled with the Mindlink, while Mind Maze was an attempt to use ESP through the Mindlink to predict what is printed on cards, which admittedly didn't work. Neither game would see release in a joystick or paddle controlled form in later years, partly due to the failing video game industry, partly due to the games' limited appeal.

Blackjack was one of the nine launch titles available when the Atari 2600 went on sale in October 1977.

The game is a video simulation of blackjack. The objective is identical to the card game: obtain a score of 21 (or as close as possible) without going over to win a bet. One to three players played the computer dealer in the game.

Most of the standard blackjack rules are featured in Blackjack. The player uses the paddle controller to enter a bet of up to 25 chips from an initial pot of 200. An up card is then presented, and the player decides whether to "hit" (accept another card) or stand. The player breaks the bank by obtaining a score of 1,000 chips, or is "busted" upon losing everything.

Did you grow up playing those handheld electronic football games? Initially released in 1977 (the same year as the Atari VCS), these portable football games became wildly popular, eventually spawning many variants. Thanks to 2600 programmers David Galloway and Bob Montgomery, you can now enjoy this classic handheld football game on the 2600 in the form of BLiP Football. Faithfully mimicked in appearance, audio and gameplay, BLiP Football recreates the experience of playing the original electronic football.

In BLiP Football you control a running back and must get by the defenders trying to stop your progress! You can see nine yards of the playing field at any time--when you go beyond one edge of the field, your player wraps around to the opposite edge, showing another nine yard segment of the field. The game is comprised of four 15-second quarters. On the fourth down you can optionally kick the ball instead of running it.

In addition to the default "classic mode" display (which shows red players against a black field), you can switch to an enhanced, more colorful display by pressing the SELECT switch during gameplay. BLiP Football is a two-player game, with the game controller swapped back and forth between possessions.

BLiP Football may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

Why did the chicken cross the road? So Activision could make a game about it of course! Even though Freeway looks a bit like Frogger at first glance, the two games are actually very different. According to David Crane, he got the idea for Freeway from watching a man trying to cross Lake Shore Drive during rush-hour traffic while attending Chicago's Consumer Electronic Show. 

Freeway originally featured people crossing the road instead of chickens since that was the scenario that inspired David Crane. However some people at Activision complained that they didn't like the idea of people being struck by cars, so chickens were substituted for people before the game was released.

That nasty old troll, Ollie Ogre, is at it again. He is chasing poor Daisy Damsel all across the neighborhood! So what are you waiting for, hero? Get out there and stop him! You have the blueprint (plans) for the only contraption that can knock him off. All you need now are the parts with which you build it and they're hidden in the houses of the neighborhood. What you don't need are the bombs you may pick up and encounters with fiendish Fuzzy Wuzzy! But if you complete your contraption in time you'll be able to stop Ollie and save Daisy!

So get a move on already! Daisy's counting on you!

Object of the Game:

The object of BLUEPRINT is to accumulate points by finding the parts of your contraption hidden within each neighborhood and successfully placing them in their propper positions on the blueprint for the contraption. Once the contraption is rebuilt, players must use it to stop the persuit of Daisy Damsel by Ollie Ogre. By doing so they will score bonus points and uncover clues to the hidden Password.

Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari. In Boggle, which is based on the popular word game of the same name, you must form as many words as possible from a random 4x4 grid of letters. The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.

You bounce the BUBBLE around a playfield of 36 STEPS (6 rows of 6). The BUBBLE must land on each step and turn it "on", sometimes in a particular order. The BUBBLE EATER or the PIN will pop the BUBBLE if either comes in contact with it. The BUBBLE EATER chases the BUBBLE, while the PIN descends the steps from the top row down. The PIN will pop the BUBBLE or the BUBBLE EATER if they are in its path.

The object of the game is to jump the BUBBLE around and turn each step on. When you first begin the game a short tune will play before you can start. Int the first 3 levels, jumping on a step will turn it on and leave it on; but in the last 3 levels, each time you jump on a stepit will reverse: if it's "off", it turns "on" - if it's "on" it turns "off! On some levels you must turn on a particular row or rows of steps before you can turn on steps in any other row (see LEVELS).

The BUBBLE EATER always start out in the lower right corner, waits a couple of seconds and the tries to catch you (the BUBBLE). If he lands on you or you lands on him, you lose a BUBBLE. The PIN starts out at the top, randomly choosing one of the 6 columns. Avoid the PIN as it is a fatal to the BUBBLE! You can tomporarily zap the BUBBLE EATER by luring him under the oncoming PIN. The BUBBLE EATER disintegrates and starts glowing. After a few seconds the BUBBLE EATER reappears and continues the chase. Make good use of this time! The glowing time (when you are safe) decreases as the waves advance (see LEVELS). You can turn on steps while the BUBBLE EATER is out of commission. When the BUBBLE EATER is stunned and glowing, the BUBBLE can jump on him without popping.

Thought Activision's Pitfall! was perfect the first time around? Maybe so, but with this hack you may change your mind. Bottomless Pitfall! is an exceptional revamp of the Activision classic. You'll no longer be able to take the easy way out by going left from start. Logs now roll in both directions, and when you die, you fall on the side of the screen you entered from. Other amazing features include a limitless adventure, the time counter has been increased to allow 10 hours of game play if you wish, and to make this possible, there are unlimited treasures to collect as well! Harry also now has "hit points." When you hit a log, not only do you lose score, but Harry takes damage. Get rolled over too many times, it's lights out for Harry! All of that, plus the treasures and already incredible backgrounds have gotten a face-lift as well. Pitfall! has never looked so good, since it wowed us back in the day.

Bowling is a video game for the Atari 2600 designed by Atari programmer Larry Kaplan; published by Atari. The game is based on the game of bowling, playable by one player or two players alternating.

In all six variations, games last for 10 frames, or turns. At the start of each frame, the current player is given two chances to roll a bowling ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down as many of the ten bowling pins as possible. The bowler (on the left side of the screen) may move up and down his end of the alley to aim before releasing the ball. In four of the game's six variations, the ball can be steered before it hits the pins. Knocking down every pin on the first shot is a strike, while knocking every pin down in both shots is a spare. The player's score is determined by the number of pins knocked down in all 10 frames, as well as the number of strikes and spares acquired.

Variations:

Odd-numbered variants are one player games, while two players alternate on frames in even-numbered games.

Games 1/2: The bowling ball can be moved in one direction after being thrown.

Games 3/4: The bowling ball can be moved up and down after being thrown.

Games 5/6: The ball moves straight and cannot be moved.

Physics:

Strikes are easily obtained in this game by positioning the player at the bottom of the screen and then listening to the number of "rolls" of the ball when it is tossed. On the forth roll if the player pushes the joystick in the relative north or upward direction more-often-than-not the roll results in a strike. Using this method it is not difficult to bowl games in excess of 250. Bowling a perfect game is very possible as well. This is due to a very basic physics model.

Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.

While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.

Plays the following games:

TOUCH ME - Games 1 to 4 

The computer plays a "sequence of tones" which you must match, starting with one tone and adding a new tone to the sequence each time you enter correctly. 

COUNT ME - Games 5 to 8

Play this game like TOUCH ME TM. The computer will play a sequence of digits to be matched in order. The computer adds a new digit to the sequence when you correctly follow the sequence.

When the computer shows you the sequence in the box at the center of the screen, the word WAIT will appear. When the computer says GO, it is your turn to match the sequence. If you miss, the computer will say WAIT, repeat the sequence, and credit you with a "miss". Four "misses", or correctly following a sequence of 32 digits completes the game. 

PICTURE ME - Games 9 and 10

In these one-player games, the computer will display a set of four objects in the center column. While the computer makes a distracting noise, try to memorize the order of the objects from top to bottom. the computer then scrambles the order, moves them to the left hand column, and gives you twenty seconds to remember their original order. 

FIND ME - Games 11 to 14

The computer generates a set of four objects on the screen. All, except one, are identical. Your score is based on the time taken to find the one dissimilar object. 

ADD ME - Games 15 to 18

A set of digits is generated by the computer. You score by adding the digits and entering the sum before the timer runs out. The correct answer will appear in the box at the top of the screen. There are five sets of digits per game. 

PLAY ME - Game 19 

Your Keyboard Controllers become musical instruments. Each button on the controller will generate a different musical note, allowing you to play songs. If both controllers are used, duets can be played on your ATARI Video Computer System game. The difficulty switches have no effect on this game.

SMASH!  POW!  CRUNCH!  A brick wall appears at the top of the screen, and your missions is to smash two walls off the playfield -- one brick at a time.

Use the controller to move the paddle across the bottom of the screen. With the paddle, hit the ball into the wall.  Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and you score points. 

A player or team receives five balls per game.  When you miss a ball with your paddle, the ball disappears from the screen.  Press the red controller button to serve another ball until all five balls are played.

When a team or player destroys the first brick wall, a second brick wall automatically appears on the screen.  Continue to hit the bricks of this wall and score more points.  The player or team who can destroy two walls scores the maximum 864 points and wins the game.  NOTE:  If both opponents destroy the two walls, the team who used the least number of balls wins.

At the end of two-team games, the playfield of both teams or players will flash on and off the screen.  That way, players can compare scores.  Begin a new game and create a new brick wall by pressing the console Reset button.

Because card games tend to not sell as well, this was probably Activision's least popular game. Interestingly, the instructions do not teach you how to play bridge, only how to operate the game on the 2600. Programmer Larry Kaplan estimates that the 2600 is capable of dealing 500 million different hands, and while the game was being play-tested, the same hand was never seen twice. This is a one-player game in which the computer controls the actions of the other three players.

Bugs Bunny was probably supposed to be part of Atari's Children's series, but was shelved in favor of Snoopy and the Red Baron after Snoopy tested better.  Snoopy probably got the nod because its a fast paced shooting game and Bugs Bunny is more of an action game that's played in spurts.  This isn't to say that Bugs Bunny is a bad game, it's just different.

As the title suggests, you control Bugs Bunny who has been rudely awakened from his slumber by Elmer Fudd and his rabbit sniffing hound.  Each level the hound will dig up a carrot causing our pal Bugs Bunny to appear.  Bugs must quickly run and jump in the hole that appears where the carrot was before he's shot by Elmer.  This is actually alot harder than it sounds since it takes some skill to get Bugs lined up with the hole.  To help you out a bit, the left difficulty switch can be used to make the hole wider or smaller, while the right difficulty switch controls how fast Elmer shoots.

The screen is split up into three levels with a carrot on each.  Before the action starts, the player picks which level he wants to try.  The top level is the most dangerous since its the closest to Elmer, but finding the hole on this level is worth 70 points.  The middle level is worth 60 points, and the bottom level is only worth 50 points.  Once you pick a level the hound will come and dig you up, and Elmer will immediately start shooting at you.  Underneath Elmers house on the top level there are several white dots representing Elmers current bullet supply.  If bugs stands directly underneath these bullets he can steal them and render Elmer harmless for a short time. 

It's easy to see why Snoopy won, Bugs Bunny just doesn't have the long term playability that Snoopy does.  Bugs Bunny gets very hard very fast and younger players would have trouble getting very far.  Still, for seasoned players Bugs Bunny offers more action and a challenge that Snoopy lacks.  Did Atari make the right decision in shelving Bugs for Snoopy?  It's really up to the player as both games are excellent in their own different ways.

You have been sent to investigate a life form that has been detected on a long-dead planet.  Passing through the deadly Cosmic Tunnel, you land on the barren planet's surface to find an underground world ruled by a race of intelligent Super-Bugs!  Countless numbers of these space age creepy-crawlies begin to emerge from massive subterranean colonies--along with the Phylax, genetically engineered Super-Drones that can penetrate any surface....

You must destroy the swarms of invading bugs, out to immobilize your space craft, before they completely leave their nests. At the same time, you must be on constant guard against the Phylax oozing through the hull of your craft and bent on destroying your only weapon.

ADDITIONAL EXTERMINATION STRATEGIES 

 - Your Ultrasonic Energy Packets will move towards your aiming cursor. Once you have fired, the Packets will continue in the same direction even if you move your aiming cursor. To destroy a Phylax, position your aiming cursor so that your Energy Packet will pass through the Phylax's path, then quickly move your weapon out of the line of fire. 

 - After you have advanced to a new skill level, you may find more than one Phylax has oozed through your craft's hull. This means double trouble-but double challenge, too. Use the tricky move described above on both of them. 

 - If you succeed in destroying all of the bugs leaving their nests, others will emerge to take their place-but they'll be moving faster. By keeping your Fire Button depressed as you move your weapon back and forth, you halve a better chance of putting these Super-Bugs back in their place.

Great news for pinball fans! Now you may possess your own pinball machine and enjoy your game leisurely at any time! Although you might lose the thrill of cheating the machine by shaking it, you can have a fair play. It is a genuine test of your response, your eyesight and your judgement through manipulating a pair of Flippers.

A pinball game, this one seems to have been sold predominately in Canada, as were some of the other Spectravision games.

In Bump 'n' Jump, the girlfriend of the protagonist has been kidnapped by the Black Army Corps, and he must race to save her. The goal in is to drive from the beginning of a level to the end while bumping enemy vehicles into obstacles and jumping over various large obstacles such as overpasses, and large rivers.

Due to the bird's eye view, players cannot see the large obstacles until it is too late to jump, so the game displays a flashing exclamation point when the large obstacles are about to appear.

The enemy vehicles are separated into cars and trucks. Cars can be bumped into obstacles or jumped upon and destroyed, while trucks cannot be bumped; they can be jumped upon only to destroy them, and will sometimes drop obstacles that will destroy the player. At the end of each level players receive bonus points for the remaining gasoline in their car, and the number of enemy vehicles crashed.

When Peter Pepper walks the length of an ingredient (bun, meat patty, tomato, etc.), it falls one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the level is finished.

While making burgers, Peter Pepper must deal with three enemies: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, killed, or temporarily stunned. Killing occurs when an ingredient is dropped atop an enemy, or when support for an ingredient is completely removed and the enemy falls with the piece. In the latter case, the piece will fall much farther than normal, depending on how many enemies are on it. Scoring depends heavily on killing enemies. The more enemies killed with a single sequence of falling ingredients, the higher the score. Therefore, to obtain the best score the player must endanger Peter Pepper by allowing more than one enemy to move onto the ingredient the player is on, just before the player drops it.

Peter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French Fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.

Each level becomes more difficult, with the layout of later levels making it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach ingredients.

Another long-lost unreleased prototype has now seen the light of day, thanks to a discovery by Alex Handy at a flea market in California. Alex located a cache of old EPROMs, later realizing he had come across a copy of Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park for the Atari 2600, a title released for the ColecoVision but which never saw the light of day on the 2600. With the help of long-time Atari enthusiast Joe Grand, all of Alex's finds were dumped. The bulk of the dumps were ColecoVision related, but the Cabbage Patch game for the 2600 turned out to be the find of a lifetime for Atari fans. Alex quickly posted all of the dumped binaries on his blog, including 10 different versions of the Cabbage Patch game.

As luck would have it, Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park is an impressive game, comparable in quality to many modern homebrew games. Cabbage Patch Kids is a side-scrolling game, similar to Pitfall! in this regard. The game consists of various screens that have different obstacles that must be overcome in order to proceed to the next screen. These include water-filled pits, bouncing balls, floating platforms, bees, and fires. You must complete ten screens on each level before a timer runs out. While traversing the screens you can also use trampolines to collect objects hidden in the trees for additional points.

Our thanks go out to Alex Handy for graciously sharing all of his impressive flea market haul with the classic gaming community. For more details about Alex's flea market finds, please visit his blog.

Something's amiss at the bakery!

The conveyers are spinning out of control! A torrent of cakes and pies pour from the ovens. The besieged Baker must snatch the pastries before they fall off the end, but avoid the deadly silverware. If that's not enough, there's a dancing gingerbread man that tries to out-fox the Baker and a surly janitor to sweep up the mistakes.

You must maneuver the Baker among the six conveyers. You can stop one, but neglect it or try to stop another conveyor and it's on the move again. When you catch enough pastries, you'll earn a coffee break. Rest, enjoy your coffee, and get ready for a new onslaught of runaway goodies.

Good reflexes alone aren't enough to avoid disaster. As the pace increases, planning time and margin of error vanish until the bad-tempered janitor won't clean up another spill. Can you catch all the pastries and keep the Bakery going until the next coffee break? Test your speed, skill, and decisiveness in Cakewalk, the latest video challenge from Commavid.

Trivia:

As with all CommaVid games, this one is very hard to find. It's slightly easier to find in PAL format. Early references to this game called it "Baker".

Test your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits eith the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks "fall" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level. Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a "miss indicator" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.  Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain. 

(Two-Player)

This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins.  Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's "miss indicator" as well as your own.  Bombs away!

The Atari 2600 was no stranger to games designed specifically for children.  Although Atari had capitalized on the idea that young children could play video games just as well as their older siblings (if the games were sufficiently simplified), almost no other companies decided to follow suit.  Parker Brothers was one of the few exceptions to this rule, and decided to give the children market a try.  While Atari bought up most of popular licenses such as Peanuts, Sesame Street, The Muppets, and Disney, Parker Brothers had to make due with lesser known, but still popular, characters such as Strawberry Shortcake and The Care Bears. 

The game concept in Care Bears revolves around grabbing the "Tummy Icon" from each of the Care Bears as they slowly fell down the screen.  Once all the icons were collected the player would have to arrange them in a certain order before time ran out.  Although this may sound rather easy, one has to keep in mind that the game was geared toward young children, so things had to be kept simplistic.  

Care Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull.  Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped, and Care Bears was quietly killed (figuratively, not literally).  According to Laura, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted.  The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids.  Marketing being out of touch with the real world was a common theme in the 80's game industry, and is partially blamed for the death of some of the biggest game companies such as Atari. 

Although Laura described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.  The prototype shows two Care Bears (minus the Tummy Icons) floating on a screen with some clouds in the background.  The top Care Bear slowly moves left to right around the screen until he wraps around, while the lower Care Bear can be moved left or right by the player.  Beyond this, there is nothing else to do in this prototype.  The only other thing to note is that when the player reaches the far right of the screen, the screen will extend downwards a few scanlines.  This is most likely a programming bug rather than an indication of any planned gameplay.

While most collectors won't mourn the loss of a childrens game (especially one geared towards young girls), Care Bears is an interesting example of how some game designers attempted to break the mold and try something new.  It is hoped that Laura's almost complete version of Care Bears can be found one day.

The goal is to shoot at targets, while carefully avoiding running out of bullets. The targets that scroll across the screen, in rows that alternate going from left-to-right and right-to-left. Targets include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If the duck targets aren't shot, they eventually come to life and begin descending towards the bottom of the screen in a zig-zag pattern. If a duck reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot first, it will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets when shot. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; all the pipes must be shot before the round can end.

At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins.

In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.

Displayed from an overhead perspective, there are three card games to choose from: blackjack, five-card stud poker, and poker solitaire. Except for poker solitaire, each game always has the computer as the dealer, and bets are made by rotating the wheel on the controller and then pressing the button.

There are two different blackjack games: Game 1 allows for up to two players and hand splitting, and Game 2 allows for up to four players yet there is no hand splitting. There are variations in the game depending on the setting of the difficulty switches. If the left switch is set to "A", the computer will shuffle after 34 hands, and if set to "B", the computer will shuffle after every hand. If the right switch is set to "A", the dealer will stay (not draw anymore cards) after drawing a 17, and if set to "B", the computer will stay after drawing an 18 or better. Furthermore, the player will win if he draws the maximum amount of cards; in Game 1, that is three or eight hits, and in Game 2, three hits.

Stud poker, which comprises Game 3, allows for up to four players. The computer, as the dealer, issues a card to each of the players and itself. Before the first card is dealt, and after each subsequent hand, until five cards have been dealt, each player must either make a bet or fold. If the left difficulty switch is set to "A", the dealer's first card is dealt face down; otherwise, it is dealt face up; likewise for the right difficulty switch for each player.

Poker solitaire is different in that no bets are made and there is no dealer; rather, the goal is to arrange cards to create the best twelve poker hands in 25 cards, with five rows, five columns, and the two diagonals. Points are scored depending on the hands created, with a pair yielding 10 points and a royal flush yielding 500 points. The highest possible score is 3340 points. The difficulty switches have no effect in this game.

Based of the Arcadia 2001 game of the same name, Cat Trax is really just a Pac-Man clone with a little hint of Mouse Trap thrown in.  It appears that UA Ltd. (makers of all the Arcadia games) was going to break into the 2600 market with three games: Cat Trax, Funky Fish, and Pleiades.  However due to the collapsing market UA wisely decided to forgo the 2600 and concentrate only on the Arcadia (bad choice there).  The original Arcadia version of Cat Trax was actually an outright Pac-Man clone called Crazy Gobbler, but when Atari started to sue companies UA was forced to change the game into what you see today. 

While their Arcadia games may have been nothing to speak of, UA's 2600 games are a different story.  The graphics may not be eye catching, but the gameplay is pretty good.  Cat Trax is often considered to be on the best Arcadia games, and it really makes a darn good 2600 game.  Your goal is to move your cat around the maze eating the catnip (dots) while avoiding the dogs (ghosts). If things get out of hand you can grab the potion to become a dogcatcher (ala Mouse Trap) and send the dogs back to the doghouse.  As if this wasn't already a big enough Pac-Man rip off, you can also eat the bonus fruit in the center of the screen for points.

Long before the actual prototype for Cat Trax was found, the game somehow showed up on a European multi-cart as "Cat and Mouse".  The game still said copyright 1983 UA at the bottom of the screen, confirming that it is indeed Cat Trax, but how did end up on a pirate multi-cart?  While it's doubtful that UA could have made a go of their 2600 games in a crumbling market, they at least showed more promise then they did on the Arcadia.  Perhaps if UA had started with the 2600 they would have had a better fate?

An Adventure type game created by Steve Engelhardt in 2009.

Here are the differences between the three difficulty levels:

Game 1 - Beginner
Enemies move at normal speed and never have a fast attack
No health reduction when changing rooms
Keys are always hidden in the same rooms
You start out with your gun, and you will never lose it.

Game 2 - Intermediate
Enemies move at normal speed with occasional fast attacks
1 point health reduction when you change rooms only after you are down to 3 health blocks left
Key locations are randomized
You start out with no gun - you will have to find it, either in the hidden room or dropped by an enemy.

Game 3 - Advanced
Enemies move at top speed all the time
1 point health reduction when you change rooms at all times
Key locations are randomized
You start out with no gun - you will have to find it, either in the hidden room or dropped by an enemy.
Falling rocks in the locked caves will fall twice as fast

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The player is represented by a small, "somewhat humanoid head" at the bottom of the screen (Later described as being a garden gnome in the trivia section of the cell phone interpretation). The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board.

The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. Thus, more mushrooms on the screen cause the centipede to descend more rapidly. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes four hits to destroy.

If the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment "head" centipedes are periodically added. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, a new centipede forms at the top of the screen. Every time a centipede is eliminated, however, the next one is one segment shorter and is accompanied by one additional, fast-moving "head" centipede. A player loses a life when hit by a centipede or another enemy, such as a spider or a flea. The flea leaves mushrooms behind when fewer than five are in the player area, though the number required increases with level of difficulty.

Scorpions poison every mushroom they touch, but these never appear in the player's movement region. A centipede touching a poisoned mushroom hurtles straight toward the player's area. Upon reaching the player's area, the centipede returns to normal behavior.

Okay, soccer fans, the ATARI CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER Team challenges you to a game. The ATARI computer team is waiting impatiently inside your Game Program cartridge for you to select one of the single player games (Games 28 through 54). They want to show you their stuff. Here's a brief rundown on each player, just so you'll know who you're up against. 

"CRASH" MORGAN, the galloping goalie, is the fastest man on the team. "CRASH" got his nickname because he is forever slamming into the goal posts chasing after the ball. Fortunately, the goal posts are never damaged, but sometimes you can score a goal on him before his ears stop ringing. 

NICK DANGER, the frantic forward, is mean and nasty and just loves to blast the ball into your goal shouting, "eat leather, chump." Don't let his bad manners bother you, it's just his way of rattling the opposition. 

"LUMPY" DURAN, the left back, is without a doubt the clumsiest player in the world of soccer. Penalized twice for stepping on the ball instead of kicking it, he was finally thrown out of one game for toe-kicking the referee! 

ALEXIE PUTSNOWSKI (Putsy), the right back. What can we say about Putsy? A real ladies man, a great soccer player, a sore loser. Even though "The Puts" has kicked and gouged his way to soccer stardom, for three years in a row he has been voted the "least likely" player.

Gameplay:

Chase the Chuck Wagon is a maze game where the player must guide a dog through a maze in order to reach a chuckwagon.

History:

As part a promotion involving the Chuck Wagon line of dog food, Purina contracted video game developer Spectravision to create a game themed around dogs and dog food. Customers could redeem proofs of purchase from bags of dog food in exchange for the game, an example of a new marketing technique that emerged during the popularity of video games in the early 1980s. In practice, the promotion was relatively unsuccessful, and the game is nowadays something of a collector's item. The unshipped cartridges were destroyed.

Among Collectors:

The game has something of a reputation among collectors of Atari video games. It is far from the rarest of games for the Atari 2600, yet the mystique surrounding its history grants it a disproportionate amount of interest. It is commonly referred to as the Holy Grail of Atari 2600 video game collecting.

Activision's Checkers is a visually pleasing version of the classic board game, and one of Activision's initial four games. Checkers follows the same rules as the board game that most of us grew up playing. For example, if you can jump you must, if a piece is jumped it is removed from gameplay, and so forth. You can choose to play against the computer at three different difficulty levels (novice, intermediate, or advanced), as well as against a human opponent. There are no cool Activision patches for Checkers, but who needs a patch when you can have the satisfaction of beating a 25 year old computer! (Contributed by panda_racer)

Chopper Command is a video game by Activision released for the Atari 2600 game console in June 1982. The game was successful due to its perceived superiority to Atari's home version of Defender; Chopper Command shares many similarities in gameplay to Defender. Chopper Command was programmed by Bob Whitehead.

Chopper Command involves the player controlling a military helicopter in a desert scenario protecting a convoy of tractor trailers that are in position on the ground. The goal is to destroy all enemy fighter jets and helicopters that attack the player's helicopter and the friendly trucks traveling below. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives, or when the player reaches 999,999 points. The game also utilizes a type of radar in order to detect enemy craft not visible on the main screen.

Like many Activision titles, a player who achieved a particularly high score could receive a video game sew-on patch relevant to that particular game.

I decided to post progress on my first Atari 2600 Homebrew "Circus Galacticus". The setting is a futuristic gladiator tournament, where combatants duel each other to the death for the pleasure of the galactic empire. The game will comprise the player's fighting career, with the difficulty and rewards ramping up with each new match. A match ends when one gladiator loses all of his shields, and is fried by his opponents laser beam. The player begins a match with three shields, while each new opponent gains more shields up to a maximum of five.

Gameplay in Circus Atari is very similar to that of another Atari video game, Breakout. A clown sits on a seesaw, which is controlled by a paddle controller. A second clown jumps from the side of the screen. By moving the empty side of the seesaw under the falling clown, the other to be propelled into the air. At the top of the screen are several rows of colored blocks (the game manual states they are balloons). These blocks are destroyed when the clown comes into contact with them. As the clown comes down, he must be caught by the seesaw, propelling the other clown into the air. By pressing the button on the controller the seesaw can be flipped around. The object of the game is to destroy balloons and score points. Destroyed rows of balloons are eventually restored, depending on the game variant (see below).

Game Variations:

Game 1: Breakout Circus. The clowns bounce off balloons when they hit them.

Game 2: Similar to Game 1, although there is a set of barriers under the balloons.

Game 3: Breakthru Circus. The clowns do not bounce off balloons, they go through them as they pop.

Game 4: Game 3 with barriers added.

Game 5: In Games 1-4, after an entire row of balloons is popped a new one is created. In this mode however, all three rows of balloons must be popped before new ones are created.

Game 6: Game 5 with barriers added.

Game 7: Game 7 is for two players. Both players share the same wall of balloons, alternating turns. Each player's score is individually tracked.

Game 8: Game 7 with barriers added.

Climber 5 is a port by Dennis Debro of an Atari 8-bit computer game that originally appeared in COMPUTE! magazine back in 1987. In Climber you play the role of a baseball player. The baseball has been hit to the upper rafters of a building under construction. Your job is to climb the ladders and retrieve the ball. Of course, there are obstacles along the way that you need to avoid or you lose a life and must start over at the bottom right corner. Once you successfully retrieve the ball, the level changes and becomes more difficult. You can view a screenshot from the original Atari 8-bit version (which you can see here) and can read the original COMPUTE! article here.

AtariAge and Dennis Debro sponsored a Climber 5 Label Contest. The winning label created by Jason Dvorak adorns all copies of Climber 5 sold. You can purchase a copy of Climber 5, complete with a full-color, 16-page manual (which itself features a four page comic), in the AtariAge Store.

This is Colony 7. Jarvian hostiles sighted inbound. Non combatant personnel are retreating to shuttle bay. We are preparing to defend position. City-wide shield is active. Gun emplacements are standing by. Special Weapon is primed.

We will not retreat.

We will survive.

Your mission is to defend Colony 7 from the evil Jarvians. Wave after wave of enemy fighters strafe the Colony's defensive shield, attempting to break through. You're in command of the Colony's defensive guns, unleashing a converging stream of laser fire at the attacking hordes. You must wipe out the invading craft before either the cannons or the entire Colony are destroyed.

Use your joystick to steer the targeting crosshairs around the screen. The defensive cannons will automatically fire salvo after salvo towards the current crosshair position. Your goal is to completely annihilate each attacking squadron, since even a single attacker breaking through can destroy your colony. If the situation seems desperate, hit the fire button to activate the Mega Blaster, your special weapon that, in one blast, will empty the sky. Use it sparingly. Each shot drains an entire Fuel Cell, of which the Colony has only three. If you succeed in destroying a squadron, it will soon be replaced a new, even more dangerous one.

Four different types of enemies will attempt to destroy your colony! The Fighter is the most common element of the Javian fleet, and several of them will attack simultaneously, first blasting away the Colony's defensive shield and ultimately destroying the colony itself. They will also destroy your cannons if you are not careful. When The Advisor appears, it will guide the fighters faster to their targets, so destroy it quickly! The Bomber will launch a guided payload directly at one of your cannons, so you must be alert for its presence and if it succeeds in launching its bomb, destroy it before it reaches its target. And when The Scout enters your field of view it will call in replacement ships, so be sure to give it your utmost priority!

Can you save Colony 7 from destruction?

Colony 7 was created by Manuel Rotschkar, whose previous Atari 2600 homebrew games include Gunfight, Seawolf, Star Fire, and Crazy Balloon. Colony 7 is modeled after the 1981 arcade game of the same name. If you've ever played the arcade game, you'll appreciate how Manuel Rotschkar has recreated the frenetic energy of the original on the Atari 2600!

COMBAT SYNOPSIS:

Combat is an early video game by Atari for the Atari 2600. It was released as one of the nine launch titles for the system in October 1977, and was included in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982. Combat was based on two earlier black-and-white coin-operated arcade games produced by Atari: Tank (published under the Kee Games name) in 1974 and Anti-Aircraft II in 1975.

Earlier in 1977, Coleco had released the similarly titled Telstar Combat!, an entry in its Telstar series of dedicated consoles. Unlike the Coleco game, Combat had color graphics and numerous gameplay variations. The 27 game modes featured a variety of different combat scenarios, including tanks, biplanes, and jet fighters. The tank games had interesting options such as bouncing munitions ("Tank-Pong") and invisibility. The biplane and jet games also allowed for variation, such as multiple planes per player and an inventive game with a squadron of planes versus one giant bomber. Atari also produced a version of Combat for Sears titled Tank Plus (alluding to the original arcade game Tank). It was released as the pack-in game with Sears "Tele-Games" branded Atari 2600 console, the Sears Video Arcade. Combat was programmed by Joe Decuir and Larry Wagner.

Gameplay:

Combat boasted having 27 games in one, which were all variations on the tank, bi-plane, and jet gameplay.


Tank Game

The Tank game in Combat had the basis of two tanks controlled by players each moving around a playing field and shooting the other player until time ran out. The player with the higher score would win. There were various types of shots a player could have depending on which level they chose, including straight missiles, guided missiles, and Tank Pong in which the shots would bounce off the walls, with variations upon whether a direct hit could strike their opponent, or a strike required a billiard hit. There was also an Invisible Tank in which the players would be invisible except for a brief few seconds after firing, and Invisible Tank Pong option. Along with the play styles there were also mazes to choose from including an empty field, a simple maze and a complex maze.

Biplanes

Another set of level choices in Combat were the Biplanes. Unlike the Tank version, this was played with three types of firing shots (straight-missile, guided missile, and machine guns). However, there were several different gameplay modes. Players had the option of fighting one on one, having a pair of Biplanes each that moved and fired in tandem, or have one player control three tandem Biplanes against one large Bomber. The Bomber's shot was an oversized projectile that otherwise behaved as a straight-missile. Instead of having mazes to fly through, there were two clouds in the middle of the stage that either player could fly into temporarily hiding them from view of the other player.


Jet

Very similar to the Biplanes level, was the Jets option. In this mode, only straight missile and guided missiles were used. It still had the same map options and squadron options as the biplanes mode, with Jets flying singly, two-on-two, or three-on-three.

Anyone who has played an Atari 2600 is familiar with the classic two player shooting fest that is Combat.  Not only was it the first game released for the 2600, but it was also included with all new 2600's until 1982.  Needless to say Combat was one of the most popular games for the 2600 (and the most common much to the bane of collectors everywhere), so it was only natural that Atari would want to make a sequel to the game that started it all.  But for a sequel to be successful, it needs to add new twists without taking away any of the gameplay elements that made the original game a hit.  Unfortunately Atari only got the first part right. 

Combat Two does indeed at new twists to the old classic.  The first thing most people notice is that the cramped arena style boards of the original have been replaced with a large landscape of forests, rivers, and bridges.  The forests give the player some cover from enemy bullets as you can drive through the forest blocks, but must shoot them out of the way to hit the player.  The brick walls act very similar to forest blocks, but cannot be driven through.  The river doesn't seem to effect the tanks at all as they can be driven over with no penalty, it is unknown if the final version would allow the tanks to go through the water or not.  Bridges provide a route over the water but with a large speed penalty, so perhaps the water is supposed to be a barrier after all?  Combat Two features a built in level designer where players can set up the walls or forests on their side of the screen, making for some interesting playfields.

Each player now has a base in a corner which they can take cover in.  This base provides shelter against a few hits, but also allows the player to launch a cruise missile.  The cruise missile automatically homes in on the enemy for an almost guaranteed hit, but can only be shot from within the base and takes time to recharge.  Perhaps the biggest change to the game is the addition of armor, each player now has three layers of armor to protect their tank (no more one hit kills).  Each tank shot will lower the enemy's armor level by one, and a cruise missile hit will lower it by two.  Armor levels will recover over time, but three successive hits will destroy the tank.  You can tell how low your armor level is by the color of the tank and by the status of the tank picture in the status bar which will worsen with each hit.  Unlike its predecessor where each player had infinite lives, players in Combat Two only have three lives to work with.  The player left standing at the end wins. 

While all these new options may have made for a more interesting game, they took away the gameplay elements that made the original so much fun to play.  Combat went from being a two player fast action shooting fest to more of a slow strategy game, no longer suited for the quick grudge match.  Had Atari called this game "Tank Battle" or "Tank Commander" no one would have batted an eye, but when you slap the Combat name onto a game it had better live up to it's successor.  Combat Two was just too far of a departure from the original, and probably would have disappointed many fans.  Also disturbing is the fact that Combat Two is two players only.  This was ok in 1977, but by 1982 a computer AI should have been implemented and would have improved the playability immensely.  Only tanks are featured in this version, it's thought that the final version would have included the planes and jets that made the original such a hit.  Maybe a more complete version is out there somewhere...

Ask anyone what games they played on their Atari 2600 when they were younger, and invariably Combat will be included among the titles listed. For many years, Combat was the pack-in game that came with every Atari 2600 sold, and even today it's tough to avoid stumbling among Combat cartridges when you're looking for 2600 games. The premise in Combat is fairly simple. You and a friend battle one another in tanks, bi-planes and jet-fighters to see who can score the most points in a fixed amount of time.

The original version of Combat supports many game variations, but few unique playfields. Zach Matley has created a new version of Combat, dubbed Combat Redux, that allows for 28 unique playfields. This new version of Combat supports seven groups of four playfields each: seven open mazes, seven easy mazes, seven complex mazes, and seven cloud designs. The first three groups are for tank games, and the last group is for jet-fighter and bi-plane games.

AtariAge and Zach Matley sponsored a contest on AtariAge to solicit playfield designs for Combat Redux. The response was overwhelming! You can view all the winning entries that appear on the cart at the above link.
 
What's New:

Features 28 new playfields selected in a contest held on AtariAge. Playfields and game variations can be selected with the joystick.

Combat Rock was an interesting experiment by Paul Slocum (creator of the Synthcart) to see if he could add background music to an existing 2600 game. His first victim was Atari's Combat! While you play the game, you're treated to a rendition of "Rock the Casbah" by the Clash.
 
What's New:

Sound coding has been added to the game, so that it plays "Rock the Casbah" as you play.

Commando Raid is a single player, full color game simulating Arcade Action and designed to be played on the ATARI Video Computer System or the Sears Video Arcade.

You are in defense of your buildings which have come under attack by android commando raiders. Without warning they appear, intent on capturing your buildings and destroying your gun emplacement.

First the troop carrying helicopters fly in dropping android paratroopers to test your defenses. Soon the sky is filled with fluttering helicopters and wave after wave of android paratroopers. They must be destroyed! Each paratrooper allowed to land on a building destroys a portion of that building. If three paratroopers land on a building. It will be totally destroyed and must be considered under commando control.

Worse still, the androids can now tunnel towards your gun emplacement. Each paratrooper who lands on that building expands the tunnel. If they are not stopped, they will plant an explosive charge under the gun.

In the midst of the battle, an aircraft may appear. It will drop a devastating bomb which can destroy all buildings and the gun emplacement. You must shoot it down or at least shoot the bomb it drops. If you miss, its back to basic training!

The player (a soldier named Super Joe) starts by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter, and has to fight his way out singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers.

Super Joe is armed with a sub-machine gun (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades. While Joe can fire his gun in any of the eight directions that he faces, his grenades can only be thrown vertically towards the top of the screen, irrespective of the direction Joe is facing. Unlike his SMG bullets, grenades can be thrown to clear obstacles, and explosions from well placed grenades can kill several enemies at once.

At the end of each level, the screen stops, and the player must fight several soldiers streaming from a gate or fortress. They are ordered out by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away, although shooting him in the back awards the player bonus points. Along the way, one can attempt to free prisoners of war as they are transported across the screen by the enemy.

Aliens from the communist planet of Rooskee are invading peaceful, democratic planets and turning their inhabitants into "Communist Mutants." The communist mutant armies are controlled by the Mother Creature, a strange alien who has gone mad due to irradiated vodka.

Gameplay: 

Communist Mutants from Space is a typical 80s-era Space Invaders-inspired space shoot-em-up. The player starts off with three reserve cannons. The object is to destroy the mutants aliens and, most importantly, the Mother Creature. The mutants hatch from moving eggs at the top of the screen. Because the Mother Creature replenishes eggs when they hatch or are destroyed, it must be defeated before the player can advance to the next wave. If a mutant or a bomb thrown by a mutant comes into contact with the cannon, the cannon will be destroyed and a reserve must be called up. A new cannon is awarded on every other wave.

Game Menu:

The menu allows a variety of gameplay changes; for example, the player may toggle the shield option on or off. If activated, "shield" mode allowed a player to press down on the joystick to become invincible for a short period (only one shield was allotted per level). Another feature was the "time warp," which allowed the player to press up on the joystick to temporarily slow down the passage of time for his opponents (i.e., they move slower than usual). Additionally, the type of shot fired could be changed by activating the "penetrating fire" option (which enhanced the beam fired so that it could withstand hitting two mutants rather than a single one) and/or the "guided fire" option (which caused the beam to be moved with the joystick rather than firing in a straight line).

The menu also allowed for multiple players (up to four) to be entered into the game. Players one and three shared the first joystick while players two and four shared the second.

Easter Egg:

Communist Mutants from Space was released back in a time when programmers were very rarely allowed credit for their work. In the tradition of Adventure, Steven H. Landrum, the project's programmer, hid an easter egg in the game in which holding fire and the power switch of the Atari 2600 would cause the "HI" on the high scores screen to change to "SHL."

Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.

Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. 

Moving the pieces is also an unusual process.  Each player controls a bar which runs horizontally across the width of the playfield.  You must place the bar over the piece that you wish to move.  You must then press the red firing button once if you wish to move a pawn and twice if you want to move your captain.  Once your piece is 'locked in' you can move it either horizontally or vertically.  However your piece cannot move over a spot which is already occupied by another piece.  Your Captain has the ability to move into a space occupied by one of your opponent's pawns.  If this occurs, you will send his pawn back to its starting position. 

While you move your pieces, you'll constantly use up your energy which is monitored at the top and bottom of the screen.  When you are completely out of energy you'll be immobilized for three seconds, allowing your opponent to move pieces without any trouble.  At the end of the three seconds, your energy will be completely recharged.  Throughout the game a pod will move around the playfield with the letter 'E' flashing on and off.  If you touch it while the letter appears you'll be receive a full supply of energy no matter how much you might have remaining.

Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.

As is characteristic of early platform games, as the protagonist has no offensive abilities and depends on timing jumps and movement to avoid enemies, obstacles, and complete the level.


Levels:

Like Donkey Kong, the levels are composed of a series of four single screens that loop in a higher difficulty when completed.

Screen 1: Primate Peak  This level most resembles Donkey Kong; the player must travel to the top of a hill while avoiding coconuts being thrown by a large gorilla. Also walking around the level are several small monkeys who attempt to grab the player. They can be shaken off by jumping in place, but if three of these monkeys attach to the player, the protagonist will be thrown off the cliff face.

Screen 2: Snake Lake  This level contains a grassland that is connected to a series of square platforms with thin pathways between. The player must avoid scorpions on the grass, snakes on the platform, and time movement with hippos in order to complete the level.

Screen 3: Rhino Ridge  This level takes place in a wide-open Savannah environment where the player needs to navigate around rhinos charging in different directions. Stepping in the puddles results in death, but the player can hide in the empty holes. The rhinos can also be jumped over.

Screen 4: Lazy Lagoon  This level closely resembles Frogger, as the player must cross a body of water by walking on and off various lily pads, logs, hippos, and large fish.

When the Atari 2600 port came out, it was a flop and was missing the second and third levels due to the 2600's hardware limitations.

    <desc>
Cosmic Ark is a 1982 Atari 2600 video game, developed and published by Imagic as the sequel to Atlantis. The objective is to gather specimens from different planets aboard a cosmic ark, which contains the survivors from the city of Atlantis.

Gameplay:

In the first stage, the player must fend off meteor showers from all four sides of the screen by pushing the joystick to fire in the desired direction. The second stage requires the player to pilot a shuttle to a planet and use its tractor beam to pick up life forms. While near the planet's surface, planetary defenses will fire at the shuttle. If hit, one previously captured specimen will be freed, forcing the player to retrieve another. After a set period of time, a klaxon will warn of renewed meteor activity, and the player must return immediately to defend the ark.

Cosmic Ark does not provide a set number of lives. Instead, the player's ark starts with 40 fuel units, which are lost with each meteor strike or shot fired, and gained by destroying a meteor or capturing a life form. Capturing both life forms from a planet before the warning klaxon will top off fuel reserves. If the ark run out of energy, the next hit it takes will end the game.

Like its predecessor, Atlantis, Cosmic Ark ends with the destruction of the Ark but the smaller shuttle ship escaping. However, a sequel was never made to address this.

Versions:

There are two versions of Cosmic Ark. One allows the player to toggle starfield display by changing the Atari 2600's "TV Type" switch. The other version features a starfield display that cannot be disabled.[5] This game is historically notable in part because the starfield effect uses a hardware bug in the Atari 2600.

Cosmic Commuter is a fun, fast-paced shoot-em-up in which you dodge or shoot obstacles, pick up passengers, and try to avoid running out of fuel. It was released in 1985, a year after the great videogame crash, and is one of the rarer Activision games for that reason. The cartridge features a simple blue and white label that is quite different from that of any other Activision game. (Contributed by sdamon)

LOST IN A FAR AWAY GALAXY

The expression "Lost in Space" takes on new meaning when it happens to you.   You're suspended in time - caught in hostile space between the edges of the galaxy where only your best star cruiser navigational skills can bring you home.  And as if that's not bad enough, you are under constant attack from all sorts of space vermin from alien monsters to rogue fighters.  Keep your wits about you and your turbo lasers blasting and maybe you'll have a chance.

MOVING YOUR CANNON

Your laser cannon moves in the same direction that you move the joystick - up, down, left or right.  Firing is a little bit different.  Move the joystick in the direction you'd like to fire, but you don't have to hold it there because the target computer will aim in that direction until you change it.  For rapid fire, hold the action button down.

GAME SELECTION

GAME 1:  The easiest of the four variations.  For one player only.
GAME 2:  The second most difficult variation.  For one player only.
GAME 3:  The third most difficult variation.  For one player only.
GAME 4:  The hardest of the four variations.  Don't start on this variation unless you're an arcade ace!  For one player only.

SCORING

Depending on which aliens you destroy, they're worth 30 or 40 points.

GAME FEATURES

At the beginning of each game, you start off with six laser-cannons.  You can be destroyed if you steer into the side of the corridor, if you're shot by an alien, or if you crash into one.  The number of cannons you have left is displayed at the top of the screen, under the score.

BLASTING MORE ALIENS

Some strategical advice:  keep that Fire Button down all the time, and when nothing is on the screen, aim up.  This way you won't be caught by surprise.   And when everything looks hopeless and a slew of bullets is heading toward you, change directions from up or down or vice versa.  Sure, it's a last resort, but sometimes the bullets will take a slightly different curve and miss you.

The Termites invade the main power-conversion chamber and begin assembling a haphazard nest. Your crew is working feverishly, opening crates of tiny remote-controlled planetary-probe ships. Its up to you to pilot a fragile probe ship into the power chamber and clear out the invaders before they jam it totally. By docking with your refueling ship when necessary, and by energizing the nest blocks so your probe ship's fire can destroy them, you may be able to prevail against the invaders and save WAYPOINT.

This game was developed concurrently for the Atari 2600 and 7800, but only the 7800 version was released. The 2600 version only has three levels as opposed to six on the 7800, but those three levels are well utilized considering the limitations of the 2600. 

As an Ornithologist, you must protect the eggs of the South American Hornbill that are nested in your tree. Various predators attempt to steal the eggs from under your nose. Using your slingshot, you must defend the eggs until the timer runs out. If a predator steals an egg you still have a chance to save it, but you risk losing other eggs from the tree while you are distracted. 

Next you must protect the Hornbills that have chosen to nest in the sewers, where the gameplay is the same as the tree level. Finally you move onto a bonus round at the Rooster Ranch, here you must shoot roosters that pop out of windows.

This version of Crack'ed was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, complete with a unique label, box and instructions.

Crackpots has nothing to do with any type of illegal drugs in any way. Instead, you're given the task of defending an apartment building against mutant bugs that are crawling out of the sewers. As Potsy, a gardener, your only defense against these creepy crawly creatures is to drop flowerpots on them as they come out of the sewer and head for the windows. The patterns vary for each color of bug, and if six or more bugs get through the open windows, part of the building will be eaten away, and you will have to replay the level. It seems simple enough, but it gets very fast and quite hectic in the later levels. Racking up 75,000 points or more made you eligible to send your score to Activision to receive the Crackpots patch.

THE OBJECTIVE

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy ships, helicopters, planes, giant sharks, sting rays, squids, angler fish and lobsters before running out of fuel or crashing the flying sub. You may also acquire points by picking up the treasures that lie on the bottom of the sea.

THE GAME

Reinforcements: You begin each adventure with three flying submarines in reserve. If you are able to fill the prize indicator at the bottom of the sea with six treasures, you will be awarded an extra life.

Fuel: The fuel gauge is located at the bottom of the screen. Keep your eye on it. Refueling is asccomplished by docking with the mother ship, the Sea View (the submarine at the top of the sea). The fuel supply gained is proportional to the amount of time docked with the Sea View.

Crazy Balloon is a port of the 1980's arcade underdog, which is the grandfather of games like Kuru Kuru Kururin. In Crazy Balloon you must carefully navigate your balloon through many varied levels full of different dangers. As if navigating these treacherous wasn't already nail biting, you will encounter additional hazards such as moving spikes or "Hurricane Man", who will try to blow you against a spiked wall!

Author Manuel Rotschkar (whose previous games include Seawolf, Star Fire, and Gunfight) Initially wrote this game to submit it for the 2005 Mini Game Competition, where the goal is to write an enjoyable game in the smallest space possible. Crazy Balloon includes all 16 levels from the arcade game, and you might find some surprises you're not expecting! All the obstacles from the arcade have been reproduced as faithfully as possible, with only a few elements replaced with Atari 2600 exclusive obstacles. If you're a fan of the arcade game, you won't be disappointed!

Crazy Balloon can be ordered in cartridge form in the AtariAge Store. Includes a beautiful label and manual designed by Dave Exton.

In Crazy Climber the player assumes the role of a daredevil who is attempting to climb to the top of four skyscrapers. There are a number of obstacles and dangers to avoid including:

Windows that open and close (the most common danger).
Bald-headed residents (aka Mad Doctor), who throws objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building (with larger objects appearing by more aggressive Mad Doctors in later levels).
A giant condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber (two at a time in the early stages, as many as six or eight in later levels).
A giant ape (styled like King Kong), whose punch can prove deadly (he becomes more aggressive in later levels).
Falling steel girders and iron dumbbells (more numerous in the later levels).
Live wires, which protrude off electric signs.
Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
Some of these dangers appear at every level of the game; others make appearances only in later stages. Should the climber succumb to any one of these dangers, a new climber takes his place at the exact point where he fell; the last major danger is eliminated.

One ally the climber has is a red "Lucky Balloon"; if he is able to grab it, the climber is transported up 8 stories to a window. The window that it drops the climber onto may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.

If the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past.

If the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper, and the game continues to become more challenging.

Crossbow was a video arcade game first released by Exidy in 1983. It was later published by Absolute Entertainment on the Commodore 64 and by Atari for the 2600, 7800 and XE Game System, in 1988.

Gameplay required the player to protect a band of adventurers from afar by shooting objects that threatened them. The adventurers would enter from the left-hand side of the screen and attempt to cross the screen unharmed. If the player helped them reach the opposite side of the screen safely, that adventurer would survive for the next level, and new adventurers were occasionally granted between levels. Levels were chosen by shooting a destination on a map screen.

There are eight moving and shooting directions on the joystick. You can fire by controlling the direction on the joystick and pressing the red button.

There are two parts in this game - above ground and underground. The UFO is under your control. Press the "RESET" button to start. You have altogether 8 UFOs. There are two kinds of cannon towers on the ground, the high ones and the low ones. You will get 20 points by hitting the low one and 50 points by hitting the firing part of the higher one. Note: When moving the UFO, move it slowly and gradually. Keep the UFO in the upper-left corner after you finish shooting.

After hitting 10 towers, an underground tunnel will show up. You have three chances to enter the tunnel. If you stay outside, the firing speed of the towers will double. To pass the path, first, move your UFO to the right of the screen then down to the left with equal speed. Keep the UFO as close to the ground as possible and you will be much safer. If you do not want to enter the tunnel, you can avoid enemy's firing by returning to the upper-left corner position. 

The underground tunnel will become narrower as time goes by. You can get 50 points by hitting a tower. As the number of the towers you hit increases, the points you get for hitting a new tower increase. The highest score is 360 points. If you pass the tunnel safely without hitting any tower, you can also get 20 points. The firing speed of the towers will double if you still stay in the tunnel after you've hit 10 towers.

When a certain amount of towers are hit, the color of the ground will turn blue. (Originally, it's green.) During this period of time, you can get one extra UFO as bonus by hitting 10 more towers, either above ground or underground. The maximum number of UFOs you can gain is eight. The firing speed of the towers will become triple after you've gained all of your eight bonus points.

Your objective is to descend as far into the Crypts as possible, stealing every treasure and killing every Monster you can get your hands on. You must try to keep your Hit Count high enough to escape the Crypts alive. 

The Crypts of Chaos are a series of complicated mazes. In order not to get discouraged, please read the instruction manual carefully and draw maps of the Crypts as you travel them. 

JOYSTICK CONTROL: 

Push the joystick forward to walk down the Corridors. Passing wall segments and a stepping sound indicate that you are moving forward. 

When you reach an Intersection, tilt the joystick all the way to the left or right to turn. You will hear a "beep" to let you know that you have turned a corner and are facing 90 degrees to the left or right. 

When a Monster appears on the screen, you will NOT be able to move forward; and you must take action before continuing on. Pull the joystick toward you and to the left or right to select an Action Option. When the cursor is over the action you want, push the joystick straight forward to "lock" the option in. If needed, tilt the joystick to the left or right to aim your weapon. Press the joystick button to activate the Option.

The player controls a cartoon bear by the name of Bentley Bear, who has to collect gems located throughout trimetric-projected rendered castles while avoiding enemies out to get him as well as the gems.

Crystal Castles is also notable for being one of the first arcade games with an actual ending, whereas most games of the time either continued indefinitely, or simply just restarted from the first level.

Based on the board game Rubik's Race, Cubicolor is addictive puzzle game by famed programmer Rob Fulop.  Rob wrote Cubicolor in between programming Demon Attack and Cosmic Ark, but it was not released because Imagic wanted an action game instead.  Rob had 50 prototypes made and hid them away, hoping that one day Imagic would come to their senses and release Cubicolor.  Unfortunately Imagic folded in the wake of the great crash, and Cubicolor went unreleased.  Rob then sold off the prototypes to collectors in the late 80's for $100 each.  Some time in 1993 Rob found another 10 cartridges and sold off a second batch to some very lucky collectors who had written him personally.

The screen consists of two cubes, with player one on the top and player two on the bottom.  Each cube has 24 squares plus one blank square (5x5).  At the start of the game, the squares are randomized and a 3x3 pattern is generated.  The player must make the 3x3 center of the cube match this pattern (ignoring the 16 squares in the outer ring).  The player can move the squares by sliding them one at a time into the blank square.  This concept should seem familiar to anyone who has played the old sliding puzzle game.  Once you match the pattern, you win!  Since there's no computer opponent to play against, the player must simply try to solve the puzzle in the fewest number of moves as possible.  The two player games are a bit more fun, with two players trying to solve their cube first. 

While it may not be the most exciting game on earth, Cubicolor still fun and offers a good challenge.  Puzzle games were never the most popular genre on the 2600, but Cubicolor probably could have done fairly well if released commercially.  With the addition of some background music and a computer opponent, Cubicolor would have made an excellent addition to the 2600 library.

This game has elements of Pitfall, Adventure, and Jungle Hunt. The object of the game is to return Blackbeard's skull to your ship. To do this, you must collect two map pieces and the shovel. Once you have the map pieces, and 'X' will appear on the screen where the skull is buried, and you'll need the shovel to dig it up. You'll also need the torch to explore the caves in the game. Several enemies will make completing your mission difficult including cannibals, poisonous frogs, birds, and snakes. If you can find the sword, you'll at least be able to defend yourself. Like Adventure, there's a bat that likes to steal objects and drops them off on other parts of the island. As with Pitfall, there are deadly pits for you to fall into...

The player can run, jump, crouch, and sword fight. Push up to draw your sword (if you have it) and push fire to jump. Lives are on the lower left, health on the lower right, and inventory is at the bottom. You will lose the sword and the skull when you die and these will go to random locations.

Custer's Revenge is a pornographic video game made for the Atari 2600 by Mystique, a company that produced a number of adult video game titles for the system. The main character was based on General George Custer.

The game was first released on October 13, 1982, and has received significant criticism because of its crude simulation of an apparent rape of a Native American woman. As a result, it has been credited as being one of the worst games ever made.

Controversy:

Custer's Revenge gained notoriety for its peculiar plot. The game prompted criticism from women's rights groups who stated that the game was a simulation of rape; the back of the packaging states "she's not about to take it lying down, by George! Help is on the way." Other groups such as Women Against Pornography, Native American spokespersons, and critics of the video game industry in general protested the game. Andrea Dworkin claimed the game "generated many gang rapes of Native American women."

Aside from complaints over the game's sexual content, many found the gameplay simplistic. People also found the pornography element of the game inadequatethe two characters' appearances have been compared to Lego bricks or cardboard boxes.

The focused media attention caused the game to sell approximately 80,000 copies, twice as many copies as Mystique's other X-rated games, Bachelor Party and Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em.

Variations:

Like many other video game manufacturers of the early 1980s, Mystique went out of business. It sold the rights to its games to Playaround, which continued to market Custer's Revenge as Westward Ho for a time. Playaround made minor modifications to the game, which included making the skin of the "woman" darker and having her extend her arm and gesture to "Custer" to come over to her. It also made a version of the game called General Retreat. In this game it is the "woman" who has to overcome various obstacles to have sex with "Custer." Instead of arrows, cannon balls are fired at the woman.

Due to the game's pornographic gameplay, this game was often banned from stores or hidden behind the sales counter and only could be bought after directly asking for the game and after presenting I.D.

Dark Chambers took place in a dungeon consisting of a series of 2D mazes drawn in a top-down fashion. The dungeon as a whole had multiple maze levels, connected together using stairwells. Portions of the mazes were also blocked off by locked doors, which could be opened by finding the keys scattered through the maze. The basic goal of the game was to fight through the maze to the next stairwell, from there to the next level, and proceed through the dungeon's levels to the end.

The players were armed with a sort of bow and arrow, which could be shot in any of the eight cardinal directions. Monsters came in several varieties, although the difference was strictly graphical. When hit, the monsters would "devolve" to the next less-powerful state, before eventually being killed and disappearing. Some monsters were placed in the maze during its pre-game creation and appeared as soon as that level was entered, while others were produced in "monster generators", skull-shaped objects placed in various locations.

Monsters touching the player would cause damage, which could be repaired by eating food. Food was scattered around the dungeon and was picked up on the way. Potions were also available, which would destroy every monster on the screen when activated. Potions could be either shot with the arrow, or picked up and carried for later use.

If you've ever played a classic text adventure, a genre made famous by Infocom in the early 80s, then Dark Mage will be an unexpected pleasure for you. Greg Troutman managed to squeeze a text adventure into an 8K Atari 2600 cart, and although it's much simpler in execution than Infocom's offerings, it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.

In Dark Mage, you play the role of a jester banished from your kingdom and your goal is to find and return the king's black rose. As in most text adventures you explore the game world by moving through the four compass directions, find and use items and talk with characters you encounter along the way. This is all accomplished with relative ease through the use of the joystick controller, there's no typing here!

Deadly Duck's job is to score points by blasting his enemy the Crabs, their Bricks and the Dragonflies. Deadly can keep shooting as long as he avoids getting bonked by a falling Brick or hit by a Dragonfly's Bomb.

THE CONTROLS:

Tilt the joystick left or right to make Deadly Duck swim back and forth across the pond. Press the joystick button once to deliver one "Bill Bullet" or hold the button down for non-stop firing.

HINTS FROM THE DESIGNER...

Practice shooting bricks on Level 1 until you can hit them fairly easily. Be careful, since attempting to shoot a brick can be dangerous if you miss. After you've developed some confidence in your ability to shoot bricks, start a new game, but this time go through the first three levels before trying to shoot bricks. Now the bricks are worth 500 points and you should have a few more Ducks in reserve.

The player flies a small spaceship above a long, mountainous landscape. The land is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. The landscape wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually bring the player back to their starting point. The players ship can fly through the landscape without being destroyed.

A number of enemy ships fly over the landscape. The player's responsibilities are twofold:

1.Destroy all aliens

2.Protect the humans from being captured

The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs, which can destroy every enemy on the screen. The player also has a limited supply of "Inviso" cloaking energy, which makes the ship invisible, and able to destroy any ships it comes in contact with.

At the top of the screen is a radar-like scanner, which displays the positions of all aliens and humans on the landscape.

The Stargate:

A central feature of the gamefield is the Stargate itself, represented by a series of concentric rectangles. The operation of the Stargate depends on the current game conditions.

If a Lander is in the process of abducting a Humanoid, entering the Stargate will warp the ship to where the Humanoid is under attack.

If the ship is carrying four humanoids simultaneously, entering the Stargate will jump ahead a number of levels, allowing more advanced players to skip the easier lower levels (and also get a great number of points reward, and the extra lives, smart bombs and inviso energy associated with it). This warp jump is no longer available after level 10.

Otherwise, entering the Stargate will warp the ship to the opposite side of the planet.

Inside Jokes:

Stargate adds several new enemies to the lineup originally introduced in Defender. The names of most of the new creations are based on inside jokes.

The original enemies are now known as "The Irata." Irata is the name of Williams competitor Atari spelled backwards. Essentially, the objective of the game is to destroy Atari before it can take over the planet.

One of the other new enemies is also named after a competitor, "Yllabian Space Guppies." Bally was a major competitor with Williams in both the videogame and pinball markets.

Another new enemy is the "Dynamo," which breaks into several small "Space Hums." This is in homage to the risque song Dinah-Moe Humm by Frank Zappa.

Three new arrivals, "Phreds," "Big Reds," and "Munchies," vaguely resemble Pac-Man, a game released in the U.S. by Bally.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The level of difficulty of Defender is very high.

The player flies a small spaceship above a long, mountainous landscape (in all versions, except the Atari 2600 edition due to memory limitations; in that case, the landscape consisted of a city represented by buildings). The land is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. The landscape wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually bring the player back to their starting point. The player's ship can fly through the landscape without being harmed by it.

A number of flying aliens reside in the air above the landscape. The player's responsibilities are twofold:

1.Destroy all aliens

2.Defend the humanoids from being captured.

The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs (three, to begin with), which can destroy every enemy on the screen.

At the top of the screen is a radar-like scanner, which displays the positions of all aliens and humanoids on the landscape.

Fully functioning game. Very loosely based on the description of the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta (a.k.a. Delta Force) snipers as described at the bottom of p.116 of Inside Delta Force by Eric L. Haney (great book, btw).

Move the target off the screen to view the four sides of the building that you are sniping (white=front, red=building's left or sniper's right, black=back, green=building's right or sniper's left). You must quickly find the target (randomly placed on one of the sides) and shoot it, which is not easy. If you don't shoot the target in time, the target moves and your life meter decrements (this symbolizes the amount of time you have to terminate the target). If you shoot 2 targets you get to level 2, 4 for level 4, etc. Targets move more quickly in later levels. You also can move and then press the button to move quickly (unless your target is locked on, and then the fire button is only for firing).

It is a difficult game. Let me know what you think. Thanks to Michael for the randomization code!

Marooned on the ice planet Krybor, the player uses a laser cannon to destroy legions of demons that attack from above. Visually, the demons appear in waves similar to other space-themed shooters, but individually combine from the sides of the screen to the area above the player's cannon.

Each wave introduces new weapons with which the demons attack, such as long streaming lasers and laser clusters. Starting in Wave 5, demons also divide into two smaller, bird-like creatures that eventually attempt descent onto the player's cannon. Starting in Wave 9, the demons' shots follow directly beneath the monsters, making it difficult for the player to slip underneath to get in a direct shot.

Development: 

Demon Attack is based on the 1979 arcade shooter Galaxian.

The game was originally programmed to end after the 84th wave, as Fulop did not expect anyone to "wrap" the game. Two days after its initial release, a kid was able to beat the game. After this initial run of cartridges, Fulop went back and changed one line of code so that the game never ends, but never gets harder after the 84th wave.

Lawsuit: 

Demon Attack closely resembles the earlier arcade game Phoenix, prompting a lawsuit from Atari, who had purchased the latter's home video game rights. Imagic settled out of court, and Demon Attack went on to become the company's only hit title.

You and your best friend are spending a super Saturday at the Cosmic Carnival.  So far you've done all the usual things.  Now you're restlessly looking around for a new thrill--something exciting and different, some competitive skill sport.  Suddenly you hear a taunting voice coming from the vicinity of Target Skill Gallery. 

"Whoa, let's see what that's about!" you say as you make a sharp left and jog off in the direction of the high pitched speech.

The non-stop voice belongs to a squat, two-food tall demon parading back and forth in front of a huge, vertical shooting range.

"Hey you!" squeaks the demon, pointing directly at you.  "Would you like to command a laser base?  Like to hit targets and score points?  Are you looking for fun, excitement--a game in which you must dodge danger?  We are the demons and we dare you to try your laser-sharpshooting skills on us!  We're full of surprises.  We sidestep all over the shooting range. We yak at you until you shut us up.  We change into new target forms--precious diamonds or deadly skulls.  Hit a diamond and you'll score a small fortune in bonus points.  But beware of skulls!

"So come on, reach for your laser, exercise your trigger finger on us. Put us through our paces and we'll dazzle you with demonic tricks!"

A DARING DESERT QUEST FOR TREASURE!

All around you are long stretches of sand, ancient pyramids baking in the hot dead air, and constant danger.

The legends that brought you here are 30 centuries old.  The tales tell of thieves who plundered the Pharaoh's tomb, loading bags of gold, silver, and precious gems onto their camels, then making off into the desert.  But in the night, horrible desert beasts pursued the robbers, and the priceless treasure was scattered and lost.  Not even a camel was ever seen again.

Now you search for the lost treasure, daring the beaks and claws of the desert guardians.  As you scan the endless sand for the glitter of jewels, your eye catches sight of gliding shadows.  Something's coming!

You could turn back now and be safe.  Or you could go on, and dare to steal the Pharaoh's jewels.

GAME PLAY

The Pharaoh's lost treasures--enormous gems, big golden eggs, and silver ingots--are scattered among the ancient pyramids and obelisks.  Fly towards the treasures, then hover or hop over them to pick them up and earn points.  Use your joystick handle to maneuver.  (Follow the chart above.)

The treasures are guarded by flying and crawling beasts.  Burrowing Uwes crawl out of the sand to charge at you, and Vultures, Warrior Phleas, Scarabs, Flying Fish, and Phantom Gliders attack from the air.  Darts fly at you, spit our by the Howling Sphinx waiting at the end of the trail.  All these enemies will destroy you if they hit you.

Protect yourself by firing darts.  A direct hit destroys enemy creatures and gains you points.  You can also maneuver around enemies.  At higher levels, watch out for flame-throwing Fire Pots and dart-shooting Mini-Sphinxes.

You begin the game with five lives.  Each time you're hit or you crash into an object you lose a life, but you will recover as long as you have lives left.

The end of each desert trek brings you to the Howling Sphinx.  You must shoot this Sphinx in the middle of its face in order to get past it, all the while dodging the darts and nasty creatures it spits at you.

SUPER POWERS

Hop over any three hieroglyphs scattered in the sand to gain super powers.  Super powers give you great advantages, such as letting you destroy all enemies on screen at once or paralyze the Howling Sphinx. 

Check the Gaming Box at the bottom of the screen to find out which power you've gained and whether if requires pressing the fire button twice quickly ("DBL-PRESS").  Some powers will be used up when you double-press the fire button; other powers last for about 20 seconds.  A new power is awarded when you pick up three more hieroglyphs, whether or not the previous power was used.

There are many super powers for you to discover (some of them are described on the next page).  But beware: in the higher levels of play you can earn super problems, such as Shackles, as well as super powers.

Below the score, and in the middle, is the current Super Power the player possesses.  Below this is the Lives Remaining and Hieroglyphs Picked Up.  The Lives Remaining of Player 1 is on the left, the Hieroglyphs Picked Up is in the middle, and the Lives Remaining of Player 2 is on the right.

The dice puzzle has 16 squares of random numbers between 1-6. The object is to change all the numbers to 6 in the shortest amount of time, using the fewest numbers of turns.

When the power is turned on, each square will have the number 1. After pushing the reset button, all the dice change to random numbers. (The game is guaranteed to be solvable every time.) There is a small square that moves outside of the left side and over the top by using the joystick. When the fire button is pushed, all the numbers in the row next to the square increase by one. The numbers can also be changed diagonally. Every 5 minutes a warning will sound, up to a maximum time limit of 60 minutes. When all the dice are changed to 6, the game will automatically end displaying time used and number of turns taken.

The dice puzzle - sometimes mind boggling, sometimes a cinch, is always loads of fun. Come and match wits with the computer.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The objective of Dig Dug is to eliminate underground-dwelling monsters. This can be done by inflating them until they pop or by dropping rocks on them. There are two kinds of enemies in the game: Pookas, round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles, and Fygars, green dragons who can breathe fire. The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.

It takes four 'pumps' with the player's action button to inflate a monster until it bursts. If left partially inflated, the monster will deflate and recover after a few seconds, but half-inflating is a useful way to stun an enemy for a few moments, especially to make sure it remains in the path of a falling rock. You can also pass through the enemy while he is deflating.

The monsters normally crawl through the tunnels in the dirt but can turn into ghostly eyes and travel slowly through the dirt.

More points are awarded for eliminating an enemy further down in the dirt (the levels are color coded), and the Fygar is worth more points if it is inflated horizontally rather than vertically (because it only breathes fire horizontally). More points are also awarded for dropping rocks on enemies in order to eliminate them rather than inflating them. If one enemy is killed by the rock, it is worth 1000 points. The next two add 1500 points each and any after that they add 2000. The act of digging is itself worth points, giving ten points for each block dug, so some players do as much of it as possible in situations where the threat from the remaining monsters is minimal.

After the player drops two rocks, fruits and vegetables (and other edible bonus items, such as Galaxian flagships) appear in the center of the play field, and can be collected for points if the player is able to reach them before they disappear. These edible bonus items will appear even if the rocks fail to hit any enemies. In some versions of the game, the most points you can get for this fruit bonus is 8,000 from the pineapple.

If the player drops a rock on a foe at the same time he pumps it to death, the game will be tricked into thinking that all enemies have been destroyed, but that the level has not been defeated. Thus, all enemies will promptly disappear, and the player will be free to dig through all dirt. Until another rock is dropped, going to the next level will remain impossible.

The last enemy on a level will try to escape off the top left of the screen. Level numbers are represented by flowers in the top right of the screen and each new level is noted at the beginning of each stage on the bottom right (as seen in graphic above). In successive levels, more monsters appear on each screen and they move more quickly. A level is completed successfully when the last monster is dispatched or succeeds in fleeing.

Protagonist:

Although Namco has officially given the character of the original Dig Dug the name Dig Dug, in other games where he makes an appearance, the protagonist goes by the name Taizo Hori, and is the father of Susumu Hori, the main character in the Mr. Driller series. He is also the ex-husband of Toby "Kissy" Masuyo, the heroine of Baraduke. His name is a pun on the Japanese phrase "Horitai zo" or "I want to dig!" Many American gamers learned of his real name via the the Nintendo DS game Mr. Driller Drill Spirits, where he is also a playable character. He is additionally featured in an unlockable gallery of Mr. Driller items in Mr. Driller 2. In the Mr. Driller series, Hori is known as the "Hero of the Dig Dug Incident". In Japan, he is also the Hero of the South Island incident and is the honorary chairman of the Driller Council to whom most of the characters answer. This contrasts greatly with the PC remake Dig Dug Deeper, where the hero is simply named Dig Dug.

You've seen them do it at the circus, but can you keep the plates spinning on top of those tall skinny sticks? The action never Stops in this video version of the big top. Ali you have to do is keep running back and forth as you try to balance the plates that just never seem to stop coming. And, if you're lucky, when they all seem to come crashing down you'll be able to catch them. After this game doing the dinner dishes will seem like child's play. 

BALANCING THOSE PLATES 

To move the girl right or left, merely push the joystick controller right or left. If you see a plate that needs balancing, position the girl so that her arm is holding the pole, then hold down the action button on your joystick until the plate stops wobbling. 

If you need to catch a falling plate, just move the girl under it and let it touch her. It will automatically be replaced by another plate at the top of the pole.

Dodge 'Em is a 1980 Atari 2600 video game, a driving game based on a single screen of four concentric roadways. The player controls one car and has to drive counter-clockwise, avoiding computer-controlled cars whose sole aim is to produce a head-on collision. Each roadway of the maze has four gaps in it  at the top,bottom, left, and right of the screen  the player can use the gaps to change lanes in order to pick up other dots or to avoid the computer-controlled cars. The Dodge 'Em cartridge includes three versions of the game, accessible through the Game Select switch on the Atari 2600.

The player drives over dots while traveling around each ring, exactly like in Pac-Man. A screen is completed once the player has driven over every dot.

The player's car can travel at two speeds, a 'normal' speed which is the same speed as computer-controlled cars, or if the player presses the controller button, his or her car travels at a 'fast' speed double its normal speed. The computer-controlled cars have only one speed. Players change lanes by pushing the controller in the appropriate direction when their car is near one of the gaps in the roadway.

The difficulty selector adjusts the speed of the game. Screens 1 and 2 have a single opposing car; 3 through 5 feature two. Screen 6 is as if starting the game anew on high difficulty. The point counter resets at 1,000.

Dolphin is a unique game that requires you to use your ears as well as your eyes to be able to play the game fully. You are in control of a dolphin who needs your help in swimming through the ocean, through schools of seahorses, and being able to get the good currents (the arrows which are going in her direction) while dodging the hungry squid and the bad currents (the arrows going against her). You will hear a set of beeps before each school of seahorses appears, which is the dolphin's sonar. You must listen to the pitch to determine where you can swim through. The higher tones mean you must swim closer to the surface, while the lower tones mean you have to swim closer to the ocean floor. 

Colliding with a seahorse slows your dolphin and makes it easier for the squid to catch her, but she can protect herself by guiding herself into currents that slow down the squid. Occasionally a seagull will fly by overhead, and if the dolphin touches it, she will gain the ability to drive the squid off by ramming into it. 

Dolphin is a truly unique game and still remains fun to this day. If you earned at least 80,000 points and sent a photo of your score to Activision, you would get a Friends of the Dolphins patch. You could also earn an even higher, secret high score, which would reveal a secret message. Sending a photo of this message to Activision, would net you a Secret Society of Dolphins patch.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
One of the lost Disney games (along with Snow White and Dumbo), Donald Duck's Speedboat was ready for release before being cancelled for reasons unknown.  It was cancelled so late in fact that a prototype box and several screenshots had already been shown in European 2600 catalogs.  In another strange twist the Brazilian company Polyvox may have actually licensed and released the Donald Duck complete with an official looking silver label (instead of the normal Disney blue).

As the title states, Donald Duck's Speed Boat is a racing game where you must help Donald Duck maneuver his speedboat through an obstacle course of deadly rocks, dangerous whirl pools, and other water hazards as fast as possible.  Depending on how quickly you finish the race your nephews will award you either a Bronze, Silver, or Gold cup.  While the concept may sound simple, the gameplay and challenge are outstanding.  Winning the gold requires blasting through board after board of obstacles at breakneck speeds, and even one error will end your gold cup dream.

Since this is a children's game it's impossible to actually die (who wants to be responsible for murdering Donald Duck?), so if you happen to slam into a rock at 120 MPH you only need backup your boat and continue on your way.  There's also nothing stopping the player from letting the boat slowly drift towards the finish line, easily avoiding all the obstacles along the way.  To give players an incentive for recklessly speeding towards the goal, the game won't let you score any points unless the fire button (throttle) is pressed.  This allows children to go at their own pace, and adults to go for high scores.

It's a shame that incredibly fun games like Donald Duck went unreleased, because it's fun for both kids and adults (a very hard market segment to fill).  Speculation is that the children's line-up wasn't selling as well as Atari had hoped, and they pulled the plug on the whole operation.  Perhaps if Atari had released more games like Donald Duck's Speedboat from the start they would have had more success.

The player controls DKJ and has to rescue Donkey Kong from Mario, who had captured him. Like its predecessor, Donkey Kong, Jr. is an arcade-style platform game. There are a total of four levels, each with a somewhat different theme. DKJ can move and jump for the most part, but can also climb up vines. Enemies include "Snapjaws", which resemble bear traps with eyes, and bird-like creatures called "Nitpickers" that Mario releases to thwart DKJ. If the player touches one of these enemies, he or she will lose a life. Enemies can be killed by dropping fruit onto them. At the top of every stage is Mario and Donkey Kong, and when DKJ reaches the top, he chases Mario to the next stage. Once the four levels are completed, the player restarts the game with increased difficulty and his or her points and lives retained. Up to two players can play the game alternately.

Donkey Kong is an early example of the platform genre (it is sometimes said to be the first platform game, although it was preceded by Space Panic). Competitive video gamers and referees stress the game's high level of difficulty compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience and the ability to accurately time Jumpman's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving the Lady, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The player receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points. The highest recorded score was set by Billy Mitchell on June 26, 2007 when he achieved 1,050,200 points. He has been challenged many times by Steve Wiebe, who holds the 2nd best record with 1,049,100 points, accomplished March 23, 2007.

The game is divided into four different one-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final screen occurs at 100 m. Later ports of the game omit or change the sequence of the screens; the original arcade version includes:

Screen 1 (25 m)  Jumpman must scale a seven-story construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil barrels tossed by Donkey Kong. The hero must also avoid flaming balls, which generate when an oil barrel collides with an oil drum. Players routinely call this screen "Barrels."

Screen 2 (50 m)  Jumpman must climb a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transports pans of cement. The fireballs also make another appearance. This screen is sometimes referred to as the "Factory" or "Pie Factory" due to the resemblance of the cement pans to pies.

Screen 3 (75 m)  Jumpman rides up and down elevators while avoiding fireballs and bouncing objects, presumably spring-weights. The bouncing weights (the hero's greatest danger in this screen) emerge on the top level and drop near the rightmost elevator. The screen's common name is "Elevators."

Screen 4 (100 m)  Jumpman must remove the eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. The fireballs remain the primary obstacle. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with the Lady. This is the final screen of each level. Players refer to this screen as "Rivets."

These screens combine to form levels, which become progressively harder. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels more rapidly and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get quicker. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The 22nd level is unofficially known as the kill screen, due to an error in the game's programming that kills Jumpman after a few seconds, effectively ending the game. With its four unique levels, Donkey Kong was the most complex video game at the time of its release, and only the second game to feature multiple levels (the first was Gorf by Midway Games).

Storyline: 

That story of Double Dragon is set in a post-apocalyptic version of New York City, five years after a nuclear war, where gangs and criminal organizations have taken control of the city. The protagonists, named "Hammer" and "Spike" in the original arcade versions, are Billy and Jimmy Lee, the titular duo and the successors of a fictional martial arts style known as Sosetsuken (loosely based on Jeet Kune Do). One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street and the Lee brothers receive a message from her captors, the Black Warriors, demanding to know the secrets of Sosetsuken in exchange for her safety. The Black Warriors are the largest criminal organization in the city, led by machine gun-toting crime boss Willy Mackey.

This is the basic premise of the first game as originally established by Technos Japan, although certain details of the plot change between versions of the game and publishers. The actual game has no in-game plot and the opening merely depicts a woman being knocked unconscious and carried off by the Black Warriors, with Spike and Hammer emerging from the garage in the background giving chase.

The object of the game was to take control of a dragon that had to fight its way through waves of attackers that came at you from the right hand side of the screen. Strange ball type enemies came at you but although they did not fire at you but they could destroy you if they ran into your dragon. Large saucers would make an appearance and these would shoot at you and required four hits to destroy them. Each hit reduced them in size until they resembled a small alien invader that moved up and down the screen. On the bottom of the screen a strange creature would attempt to make his way past you but you could bomb him as he crawled past. This game was just another cheap entry into the gaming market of the time, an entry that no doubt added another nail into the 2600 coffin. 

The graphics were bland and unimaginative, the sound tedious and the game play non existent and the only thing that you did get was a sore finger from constantly being forced to press the fire button on the joystick in an effort to reach the ten thousand points. Simply speaking, a cheap excuse of a game. 

This game was known in Germany as Im Schutz der Drachen.

Your kingdom has been taken over by dragons and it's your duty as the Prince to get all the king's treasures back from those nasty dragons. Dragonfire is a simple game consisting of two screens. First you must traverse the drawbridge to the castle while dodging fireballs being shot towards you by the dragon. You must use quick reflexes to duck under the high ones and jump over the low ones. If you make it to the other side you'll find yourself in a a room full of treasures as well as a rather large dragon at the bottom of the screen. You must then gather the treasure as quickly as possible without falling victim to the dragon's fireballs. When you collect all the treasures an exit appears and you start over again, but with a higher difficulty than before. Get hit a total of seven times and the game is over. 

Dragonfie's graphics may not turn any heads at first glance but it does feature some rather large sprites for the 2600, namely the dragons. This is a fast-paced game and difficulty does ramp up fairly quickly. The re-playability of Dragonfire is about average, but the game does wear thin rather quickly.

Making use of the Starpath Supercharger, Dragonstomper was the only true RPG for the Atari 2600, and is consistently rated in the top 10 lists of fans as one of the best games for the console.

Dragonstomper followed the adventures of a dragon hunter who was given a quest by the king to defeat a dragon and reclaim a magical amulet that was stolen. The player makes his way over the countryside vanquishing various monsters and gaining gold and experience. After gaining strength, the player enters a shop in an oppressed village where equipment can be purchased, soldiers hired, and special scrolls obtained to defeat the dragon in its lair. The final leg of the journey traverses the character into the dragon's lair where he must use all his wit and resources to avoid a series of traps strewn throughout the cave and defeat the dragon. Amazingly, defeating the dragon isn't even required to win; one of the scrolls available for purchase in the town, "Unlock", can be used to open the gate between the player and the amulet, although it had a chance of failing.

Dragonstomper represented a great programming achievement in what could be done with the Atari 2600. If not for the video game crash of 1983, more games with this type of innovation likely would have been pursued.

In November 2005, Forbes Magazine named "Dragonstomper" as "The best title ever made in the history of U.S. videogaming." Forbes singled out the game's ingenuity, noting that "there were multiple ways to solve problems. One could descend to the dragon's lair on a rope or simply jump down (and absorb some damage)."

Gameplay:

During the first segment of the game "The Wilderness", the player's goal was to either collect enough money and valuables to bribe the town guard into letting him pass through, or to find an ID that would grant him permission to do so freely. Either way, the overworld was a vast open space littered with castles, huts, churches, and other areas that could be explored.

Like most console role-playing games, every so often, a random battle would occur, with the player and enemy taking turns attacking one another until one or the other was dead; if the player expired (accompanied by a faster version of Taps being played), a simple hit of the Reset switch brought him back to life right where he lay, but with all of his collected gold lost and his Strength and Dexterity reset to their normal values. Experience points did not exist in the game, although every so often, items such as staves, potions, or magic rings would be found in the spoils of battle, or inside of the aforementioned buildings. These items had a random chance of either raising or lowering the player's Strength or Dexterity.

Monsters largely consisted of animals, insects and arachnids of various types, as well as human occupations (Maniacs, Warriors, etc.) Some fantasy-themed creatures, like slimes, also existed. Equipment was only available in the form of an axe and a shield which could be found from various locations or monsters (churches often contained shields). Once the bridge guard permitted it, the player could advance into the Oppressed Village.

Three different stores were available to the player here  a Hospital, a Magic Shop, and an Item Store. Items that were no longer needed from the Wilderness could be sold for extra gold to use to buy new, helpful tools here. Like the bridge guard before them, the three soldiers had to be bribed (either with gold, Rubies or Sapphires) to enlist with the player. Furthermore, healing potions, spells to locate and circumvent traps inside the dragon's cave, and miscellaneous goods (like ropes and bow and arrows) were available for purchase. Once the player felt ready, he would enter the Dragon's Cave, which was preceded by a few bars of In the Hall of the Mountain King.

The Dragon's Cave was simply one long, narrow hallway lined by jagged rock protrusions, with no monsters to fight, but the primary danger was traps. Two varieties existed  poison darts which flew back and forth in one set line, and invisible floor panels which, when stepped on, would trigger an unavoidable burst of flash damage. These panels could be detected with a spell, while the darts could simply be run past. Succeeding in navigating the cave's dangers would result in coming upon a pit in the floor which led to the dragon himself.

The fight with the dragon alternated with the player-character and the dragon taking steps towards one another in turns. If the player recruited any of the soldiers, they marched of their own accord up to the dragon to help serve as a distraction and occasionally dealing (and being dealt) damage. With the aforementioned "Unlock" spell, it was still necessary to successfully get past the Dragon and reach the amulet in its secluded chamber; without this spell, defeating the dragon was the only key to victory.

Dragster may be one of the shortest video games ever produced by Activision, or anybody else for that matter. Your goal in Dragster is to get your car across the finish line before your opponent. Using the joystick you must rev, clutch, and shift your way to victory, but if you rev too much your engine will blow and you'll be out of the race! If you broke 6 seconds and sent in a picture of your score to Activision, you'd receive a world class Dragster patch! (Contributed by panda_racer)

Best Electronics sold this unreleased game, originally for $12 each. It is unknown whether these are truly legitimate prototypes or just reproduced copies. In most cases, this game has some other label on it with a white warning label on it. Apparently this game was finished and ready to go, but Atari decided against it, and no label was ever made.

Dumbo's Flying Circus was scheduled to be part of Atari's children's series (which included characters from Peanuts, Sesame Street, Disney, Muppets, and Garfield), but for one reason or another it never saw the light of day.  Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.

The object of the game is to guide Dumbo around the screen and catch or shoot balloons before they reach the top of the screen (sort of like Kaboom in reverse).  Some balloons have bombs attached to them and are deadly to the touch, so they must be shot down using peanuts from your trunk.  Every now and then you will see a balloon with a clown riding it, you must shoot these balloons and catch the falling clown before he hits the bottom.  If the clown makes it to the top of the screen he'll stay up there and begin to drop things on you.  Every time three balloons reach the top of the screen the ceiling gets slightly lower, this gives you less and less room to grab the incoming balloons.  The ceiling can be raised a bit by safely catching clowns or by winning the bonus round.

At the end of each wave you are presented with a bonus round where your mouse friend (Timothy Q. Mouse) comes flying from the left side out the screen.  If you can catch him before he bounces off to the right (which is very difficult to do), you earn some bonus points and he'll raise the ceiling a bit.  After the bonus round you are shown a status screen which displays the number of clowns you've caught, and the number of lives you have left. 

After two waves you are presented with a strange intermission of sorts where Dumbo picks up and flies around the screen with a banner that says Dumbo.  It is unknown what this intermission is for, but I've come up with two theories: Since the game was made for children this may simply be a chance for them to rest a bit before continuing on with the game, or the action on the intermission screen could correspond somehow to how your doing in the game (the better you do the more interesting the intermission). 

Dumbo appears to be complete (with the exception of the intermissions), but the gameplay is still rather difficult and would need some adjusting in order to make it suitable for children.  Adults on the other hand will find Dumbo to be an amusing challenge and well worth playing (just try to forget it's a Disney game).

Dune is an unreleased prototype based on the 1984 movie of the same name. It appears that it was to be an action/adventure style game similar to Atari's classic Adventure, but given as the game was never finished, we'll never know for sure. Dune was designed by Atari programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark, but it appears programming was began by another party. This prototype appears to be only about 30% complete--the game engine seems to be done, but many of the gameplay elements and graphics are missing. Presumably this title was canceled with the Tramiels shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.

DUNGEON is a new dungeon crawl adventure by guess who? David Weavil. There is a simple reason for facing the dangers of the dungeon, The princess has been kidnapped!  Rescue her and kill the demon who commands the forces of darkness.

DUNGEON has turn based combat that any role playing veteran will instantly recognize. You move through the dungeon and when you come across a monster a battle will take place. You can RUN, FIGHT or use MAGIC.

You must find the key to the next level of the dungeon to continue. A monster on the level must be defeated to get the key. Just because this game is on the Atari 2600 don't expect it to be overly simplified. You will level up after killing enough monsters and you can find armor and weapon upgrades in chest.

Like any good dungeon there are secret passages hidden behing some walls. Along the way you will come across the Cave of the Dead and also the Lake of Fire. The is a huge variety of animated monsters to fight as you make your way to the princess at the bottom of the dungeon.

Once you find the princess all you have to do is kill the demon who kidnapped her.

So go after that bird -- if you can "bear" the pressure. Otherwise, the yolks on you !!

~From the Manual

Eggomania is an arcade-style video game released in 1982 by US Games for the Atari 2600. The objective of the game is to catch eggs in a hat which are thrown by a chicken without letting any of the eggs hit the ground and break. At the end of each round, the player has a chance to throw the eggs that they have caught back at the chicken in order to win bonus points. The speed of the game increases as the player progresses. The game has two difficulties in which the easier variation gives the player a larger hat to use to catch the eggs.

    <name>Elevator Action</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Elevator Action is a title that no one in his or her wildest dreams actually thought existed.  So when its existence was reviled on a message board there was quite an uproar.  To further complicate matters, the whole story started out as an elaborate April Fools Day joke without an ounce of truth to it.  But when by a chance meeting with an ex-Atari programmer someone was able to obtain an actual prototype, no one actually believed them.  But when it was it was shown at the Philly Classic all skepticism and criticism was put aside as collectors got to see one of the true lost classics of the 2600.

For those not familiar with the arcade game, you play the role of Agent 17 (codename: Otto) who must grab all the top-secret documents from a 30-story building and make his way to the getaway car at bottom.  Along the way you'll encounter enemy agents who will pop out of doors and attempt to assassinate you.  You can either shoot the enemy, or crush him with elevators or by shooting out ceiling lights.  Ah yes elevators, it wouldn't be Elevator Action without elevators now would it?  Along you way you'll encounter numerous elevators, which you must ride down to lower floors.  Unfortunately the enemy likes to ride the elevators too and will attempt to crush you with them, or just shoot you as you ride.  Elevators aren't the only source of transportation in the building, on the lower levels you'll find escalators which will take you down one level but leave you exposed to gunfire.  Scattered through the building are red doors which contain the top-secret documents your after.

Surprisingly the 2600 was able to simulate the look and feel of the arcade version fairly well.  The graphics are bright and well done and the gameplay (bugs aside) is almost an exact copy of the arcade.  The programmer was even able to get multiple enemy agents on the screen at the same time (if only in one color) without much flicker. This is far better than most thought the 2600 was capable of.  Unfortunately this version is still has a long way to go before being a final product, and is riddled with multiple bugs.  The most obvious sign that the prototype is incomplete is the complete lack of sound and music, although this doesn't hurt the game as much as you'd think.

You must grab all the documents before you get to the bottom of the building or you will be forced to go back and retrieve the documents you missed.   

The next thing that most people notice is that your character can fly (no really!).  If you push up to jump and keep pushing up your character will hover in the air indefinitely (right above enemy bullets).  You can use this trick to "fly" by moving left or right before pushing up keeping your character airborne as he moves about the building.  You can also do the reverse of the flying bug by crouching and moving left or right effectively hanging below the enemy's bullet range.  The jumping bug is responsible for another interesting glitch, which makes your character invincible (to a point).  If you push up while your character is in his death animation, you will break out of the death cycle and jump instead.  With careful timing you can use this trick to become invincible although you'll still have to watch out around elevators since you can't jump inside an elevator (Remember Caesar, thou art mortal!). 

Some other bugs to watch out for are wrap around bullets (stand next to the left edge of the screen and fire into the wall), walking across open elevator shafts (I guess this is related to your flying ability), and walking into the sides of escalators (push left or right while riding an escalator).  You can also see the "super secret" 31st level by push up in just the right spot on the roof, if done correctly your character will ride an invisible escalator into air and the screen will show a bunch of garbage.  The elevators are also a bit buggy in this version, and will sometimes take a minute or two to come up to your level (be patient though, if you wait they will come). 

Even though it's far from complete, Elevator Action is an amazing piece of programming given how limited the 2600's resources were.  All the features from the arcade game were preserved in the 2600 version (a rarity among 2600 arcade translations).  Players could shoot out lights, squash agents with elevators, and even ride escalators.  Its obvious Atari had a winner on its hands, but like so many 2600 arcade to home translations it was left unfinished.  Had Atari held all its games to high standards like Elevator Action they might have been able to stave off the crash a bit longer.

Atari 2600 homebrew author Bob Montgomery, whose previous 2600 creations include Go Fish! and Reindeer Rescue, has created a third 2600 homebrew game--Elevators Amiss!

In Elevators Amiss you are a maid working in a hotel gone crazy! Normally the night shift is pretty uneventful, but tonight the hotel's elevators have taken on a life of their own! You need to get to the top of the hotel, but the elevators are simply not an option. To get to the top floor you will need to race along each floor of the building to the stairs while avoiding the out-of-control elevators! And when you do reach the top, you're work isn't done as you need to tackle the next hotel, also suffering the same problem!

Eli's Ladder is an educational game aimed at children, where math problems need to be solved to help Eli and his crew climb a ladder to his space ship so they can then journey to the Moon. The game included a wall chart and stickers designed to help motivate children progress through the problems. This is one of the rarest Atari 2600 games and apparently saw fairly limited distribution.

With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published.

Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.

Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.

While it's not a bad game, Elk Attack lacks one very important feature found in its arcade counterpart.  In Electric Yo-Yo there is an indestructible enemy which roams the screen making your life miserable.  Since you can't use the power squares to stun this enemy you must carefully plan on how avoid him.  It's this missing feature that makes the difficulty level in Elk Attack too easy.  In fact it's possible for even an average player to go 10 or 20 levels without dying.  Even though the enemies speed up as the levels progress they don't become much of a factor with large number of power squares available, it's the indestructible enemy that really adds the challenge to the game.  Atari made the right decision in not pick up Elk Attack for release in its current form.  With a few added gameplay elements Elk Attack would have been sure fire hit and a darn good clone of Electric Yo-Yo.  But for one reason or another this never happened, and the game was left in its current state.

Darkness. Your head aches. Where are you? What happened to you? Then you remember the steady beep of a technical device. You start groping for the source of the tone and find a PDA laying near your legs. You grab it and watch its display.

You stare at the screen and can't tell what the numbers stand for. You stand up and move a step to the right and come to know that the small dot on the screen represents your position. You continue walking, but a wall abruptly stops your movement. You are in a giant maze and the PDA screen shows the map of this big dark surrounding! While examining the electronic device in your hands you find a button and a small stick. Your curiosity and raising panic results in pushing the button instantly. You are still standing in complete darkness, but the screen shows something like a spotlight. It seems to be produced by a radar spot scanning the caves. Moving the small stick while the button is pressed moves the spotlight around the maze on screen. You spot ways and walls on screen and decide to follow the lanes and hope to find an exit somewhere... unfortunately you come to know that the numbers in the top right corner of the screen are counting down and you feel that it can't be any good if this timer reaches zero.

Encaved is Simon Quernhorst's fourth Atari 2600 homebrew game! The game starts with the screen showing a black maze within border lines. Your position is represented by the small cursor in the left down corner. Moving the joystick starts the countdown timer and you player moves through the maze. You can't move further when you run into walls. Pressing the fire button lightens the spotlight on your screen. You can move the spotlight around with your joystick while you keep the fire button pressed. A box is hidden somewhere in each maze. Locate it with your spotlight and collect it with your player to gain more time. As soon as you found an exit and moved through it with your player, you receive the remaining time as points. If you know the maze very well already and manage to navigate through it without switching the spotlight on, you score double points. After having escaped a maze a door closes behind you and you come to know that the next maze is already awaiting your exploration...

Story
-----
Darkness. Your head aches. Where are you? What happened to you? Then you realize the steady beep of a technical device. You start groping for the source of the tone and find a PDA laying near your legs. You grab it and watch its display.

You stare at the screen and can't tell what the numbers stand for. You stand up and move a step to the right and come to know that the small dot on the screen represents your very own position. You continue walking, but a wall abruptly stops your movement. You are in a giant maze and the PDA screen shows the map of this big dark surrounding!

While examining the electronic device in your hands you discover a button and a small stick. Your curiosity and raising panic results in pushing the button instantly. You are still standing in complete darkness, but the screen shows something like a spotlight now. It seems to be produced by a radar spot scanning these caves. Moving the small stick while the button is pressed moves the spotlight around the maze on screen. You spot ways and walls on screen and decide to follow the lanes and hope to find an exit somewhere... unfortunately you come to know that the numbers in the top right corner of the screen are counting down and you feel that it can't be any good if this timer reaches zero.


Object of the game
------------------
The game starts with the screen showing a totally black maze within border lines. Your position is represented by the small cursor in the down left corner. The number in the top left corner shows the current maze and the number in the top right corner is the countdown timer. The player's score is shown below the maze.

You move through the mazes and search for the exits which are located somewhere in the outer walls of each maze.


General controls
----------------
Set up the system as described in the consoles manual. The game is controlled by a joystick in the left controller port.

Press the fire button on the title screen to start the game.

Moving the joystick starts the countdown timer and your player moves through the maze according to the joystick directions. You can't move further when you run into walls.

Pressing the fire button lightens the spotlight on your screen. You can move the spotlight around with your joystick while you keep the fire button pressed.

Press the "Reset" switch to abort the current game and return to the title screen.


Bonus time
----------
A box is hidden somewhere in each maze. Locate it with your spotlight and collect it with your player to gain more time.


Scoring points
--------------
You score the remaining time as points when you reach the exit of a maze. If you know a maze very well already and manage to navigate through it without switching the spotlight on, you score double points.

After having escaped a maze the door closes behind you and you come to know that the next maze is already awaiting your exploration... 


End of game
-----------
The game ends when the countdown timer reaches 00.

The object of the game is to be in an endurance race and to pass a certain amount of cars each day as to continue the race the next day.

Gameplay: 

Enduro consists of maneuvering a race car in the National Enduro, a long-distance endurance race. The object of the race is to pass a certain amount of cars each day. Doing so will allow the player to continue racing for the next day. The driver must avoid other racers and pass 200 cars on the first day, and 300 cars with each following day.

As the time in the game passes, visibility changes as well. When it is night in the game the player can only see the oncoming cars' taillights. As the days progress, cars will become more difficult to avoid as well. Weather and time of day are factors in how to play. During the day the player may drive through an icy patch on the road which would limit control of the vehicle, or a patch of fog may reduce visibility.

Contest: 

In 1983, Activision ran the "Enduro Race-For-Riches Sweepstakes". The grand prize was a Datsun 280ZX pace car and a trip for two to Caesars Palace Grand Prix Weekend. The second prize was a Datsun 200SX Hatchback SL, third prize was a trip for two to Caesars Palace Grand Prix Weekend, the fourth prize was one of fifty radio controlled cars, the fifth prize was one of five hundred Activision Grand Prix video game cartridges, sixth prize was one of two thousand Datsun Racing posters.

Release and Reception:

Enduro was released on February 1, 1983 for the Atari 2600. On its release if a player succeeded to race five days or more, an on-screen racing trophy would pop-up on the screen. If the player sent a photograph of this achievement to Activision, they would receive a patch declaring them an "Activision Roadbuster".

The online video game database Allgame referred to Enduro as "the best driving game available for the Atari 2600."

    <desc>
Based on the horror movie of the same name, The Entity is an interesting action game by programmer Mark Klein who was also responsible for two other unreleased TCF games (Pick Up and Look Ahead).  Much like his previous game Pick Up, The Entity deals with a rather adult theme (the movie involved a young woman who was being raped by a ghost).  This could be why 20th Century Fox chose not to release the game.

Despite the name, the game itself really doesn't resemble the movie "The Entity" at all.  In the game your goal is to move the Entity to the highest plane of existence before your energy runs out (wasn't that called Nirvana?).  How are you to accomplish this goal you ask?  An exorcism? One of those cool Ghostbuster proton packs? A virgin sacrifice?  Nope.   All you have at your disposal are walls.  That's right, walls... 

The game is divided up into several rows (planes of existence) similar to Taz, but in The Entity you can only see three rows on the screen at one time.  Between each of the rows is a portal (hole) through which you must force the Entity.  As previously stated, this is accomplished through the careful placement of walls (ok so they're really probably some kind of electrostatic ectoplasmic energy barrier, but let's just call them walls for now).  The walls are moved by pressing the joystick left and right.  Once a wall lines up with the portal it will 'lock' into place, thus giving the bouncing Entity no where to go but up.

At this point you may be saying to yourself "Hey this sounds easy!" (you've got some nerve mister!), but there's a catch.  You see the Entity doesn't like to be pushed around, in fact that makes him angry (you don't want to see him when he's angry).  So every time you force the Entity through a portal it will begin to resist by bouncing faster and pushing back on the walls more and more.  Also keep in mind that the Entity isn't stupid, if it sees that you're about to trap him, he'll turn red and begin to go berserk.  Trapping the Entity once he turns red is a difficult task at best, so try not to tip him off by keeping the walls back until the last possible moment.

Thankfully you have a secret weapon up your sleeve... Liquid Helium! (the secret weapon of choice for Entity busters since 1983).  By tapping the fire button you can give the Entity a little squirt if the ol' He and slow him down for a bit.  Ironically it's the same Helium (located in a tank at the bottom of the screen) which ultimately proves to be your downfall.  If you are unsuccessful in forcing the Entity up through the planes of existence it will plunge into the tank and cost you 25% of your energy (but on the bright side the Entity will be slowed down for a short time).   Once you run out of energy the game is over.

So why was The Entity never released?  Several factors may have ultimately lead to The Entity's demise.  First and foremost was probably the games subject matter.  Not only was the movie a little 'adult', but it wasn't exactly a box office success (unlike other TCF game's such as Porky's or Fantastic Voyage).  Another factor may have been that The Entity's gameplay, which while fun, is not stellar by any means and grows boring after only a short time.  Whatever the reason for its cancellation, The Entity is an interesting look into the darker side of 20th Century Fox.

Escape from the MindMaster utilizes a tape cassette through the Starpath Supercharger. This is used to bypass the 2K limitation of available memory in the Atari 2600. Each game has 6 levels, 2 levels per load, giving an effective total of 6K for each game, which allows for better graphics and more complicated gameplay than the average 2K cartridge. 

Gameplay:

The player's goal in the game is to solve the maze consisting of a series of hallways and rooms. The rooms either were empty, contained puzzle pegs, or has a bonus game that allowed the user to collect more points. Each level had its own individual bonus game.

The solve the maze, players had to collect keys called "puzzle pegs" that are designed as shapes to find their corresponding sockets. Only one peg can be held on to one at a time. After placing all the pegs correctly, the player is able to go on to the next level through a now unlocked door. As the levels advanced, the pegs begin to appear more similar to confuse the player. The pegs are placed randomly each time the game is re-booted. There is a time limit in which to finish the maze by, although you are not penalized for exceeding the time, you do get bonus points for each second under the time.

This must be done all the while avoiding the Alien stalker which would be roaming the maze. If it gets too close to you, you would have to start again. There are two parts to each maze, a safe part, and the part where the creature is, separated by doors. Regardless of which room the player is in, you can tell how close the creature is by the beeping he makes. The louder and faster, the closer it is. In the more advances mazes, There are also large squares that slide out of a wall into the adjacent wall which must be avoided in order for the player to progress. The third maze introduces one way doors, which disappear once you go through them, making you continue some other route.

Reception:

The game is fondly remembered as one of the great Atari 2600 games with much critical acclaim.

Special Note from Rx: Don't believe the hype.  This game has been unfairly and unmercilessly scapegoated as the cause the Great Video Game Market Crash of 1983.  This game was great when I was a kid.  Give it a try....

Description:

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is an adventure video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600 video game console. It was based on the film of the same name, and was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw in 1982. In E.T., players must control E.T. through various screens and obtain three pieces of a device that allows him to phone home. They are found scattered randomly through pits. With few exceptions, critics and gamers alike feel that it was a poorly produced and rushed game that Atari thought would sell purely based on brand loyalty to the names of Atari and E.T.  Owing to the lengthy negotiations to secure the rights to make the game, Warshaw only had six weeks before its scheduled release to develop it.

E.T. is seen as marking the beginning of Atari's downfall and is often viewed as one of the biggest commercial failures in video gaming history, as well as the worst video game ever made. E.T. was a contributing factor to Atari's massive financial losses during 1983 and 1984, and a glut of unsold copies of the game helped contribute to the video game crash of 1983. As a result of overproduction, hundreds of thousands of unsold cartridges were buried in a New Mexico landfill.

Gameplay:

The gameplay of E.T. consists of maneuvering the eponymous alien character through various screens to obtain three pieces of a device that, when assembled, allows him to phone home. The pieces are obtained by finding them scattered randomly throughout various pits, which are called wells. Alternatively, the player can collect up to nine Reese's Pieces at a time, a healing item, which allows for a call-Elliot option that makes his friend deliver one of the device pieces. Once the player has collected all three pieces, the player can call E.T.'s spaceship from a specific zone, after which there is a limited amount of time to return to the landing zone. Once these conditions are fulfilled, the game starts over at the same difficulty level, with the player's score left intact.

The game consists of six screens representing different settings from the movie. The game starts in a forest, which is also where the ship picks up E.T., and has four screens full of wells of various sizes. The player can cause E.T. to fall into wells, which may contain phone pieces or extra lives; and to escape from a well, the player must cause E.T. to levitate out. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current zone, and each zone enables the player to perform certain actions. These actions include detecting items, warping to other zones, and sending the enemies back to their starting places. Some zones can only be accessed when E.T. possesses certain items (for instance, E.T. must have at least one Reese's Piece to eat candy).

As the player moves E.T. and performs actions throughout the game, his energy supply steadily drains. The player can restore some of E.T.'s energy by eating Reese's Pieces. Extra lives are represented by Elliot merging with E.T. after his energy is depleted, thus reviving him, and letting the player continue until they are spent. Additionally, the player must avoid a scientist who takes E.T. to Washington D.C., and an FBI agent who confiscates E.T.'s collected items. The game offers several difficulty settings that affect the number and speed of humans present and/or the conditions needed to win the game.

Fall Down pits the ever-opposed forces of RED and BLUE* against each other in an ultimate battle to capture scrolling platforms! The first player to fall past a platform captures it and scores a point. Taking time to collect power-ups can give some advantage, but taking too long only results in death at the top of the screen. Watch out, because as you progress, the platforms slowly accelerate!

Fall Down includes both two-player and single-player modes against a highly effective computer opponent. Game modes include:

 - Human vs. AI
 - Human vs. AI, easy mode
 - Human vs. AI, pass-by mode
 - Human vs. AI, invisibility mode
 - Single Player
 - Human vs. Human
 - Human vs. Human, pass-by mode
 - Human vs. Human, invisibility mode

In pass-by mode, the players don't bounce off each other as in the default mode. In invisibility mode background alternates colors, making one of the players invisible. Easy mode makes the computer opponent fairly dumb.

Fall Down is one of the first homebrew games to support Richard Hutchinson's AtariVox. Fall Down uses the AtariVox to save your high score for each game mode, as well as for some in-game speech ("Red Wins! New High Score!"). When you power off your Atari 2600 and come back later to play Fall Down, your high scores will be restored!

Fall Down can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

BLUE couldn't make it for the PAL version, but his side-kick BLUEISH GREEN was more than ready to take up the fight!

In the game, the player controls a pair of disembodied lips, similar to a Chattery Teeth toy. The game's manual gives the name of the lips as Mighty Mouth.[1] Various fast food menu items fly across the screen and the teeth earns points by catching them. The player must avoid eating the purple pickles. After eating 6 purple pickles, the screen is replaced by large text reading "BURP", followed by "CLOSED". As the player acquires more points, the speed of the game increases. The transitions between speeds are indicated by the text "YOU'RE GETTING FATTER!"

Fathom is another great game from Rub Fulop, who programmed several other classic Atari 2600 games such as Night Driver, Missile Command, Demon Attack, and Cosmic Ark. Unlike his previous hits, this one is a slower-paced adventure game, in which the player alternates between playing as a dolphin and a seagull. The goal is to swim and fly through multiple screens, searching for starfish that will give you a piece of Neptune's trident. Once the trident is assembled, you can release Neptune's mermaid daughter from her prison at the bottom of the sea. The game is colorful and fun, but can become frustrating in its later levels.

The situation: You've done well in the early matches of the International Tournament of Jugglers. Most of the competitors have been eliminated. You've survived. Now it's down to the final event: the Fireball. 

Your objective: Catch the blazing Fireball and hurl it back at the wall of blocks. Rack up points by smashing blocks and clearing the screen. And prove your skill as a juggler by keeping a number of Fireballs in the air. First one, then two, three, four... 

You have five tries, just in case the Fireball becomes a little too hot to handle.

After programming Breakout and Asteroids for Atari, Brad Stewart created Fire Fighter for Imagic. Fire Fighter places you in the role of a fireman attempting to save a panicked man from a burning warehouse. Your goal is simply to achieve the rescue in the minimum amount of time. Games tend to be very short, although variation 9 allows the player to rescue 8 victims in a row from increasingly taller buildings. Like most Imagic games, Fire Fighter has good graphics, but the gameplay is unlikely to engage most players for very long. (Contributed by sdamon)

TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a powerplant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a smmall, black hole.  After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconsciouss.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed. 

The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.

During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.

Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  

To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.

In Fishing Derby, two fishermen sit on opposite docks over a lake filled with fish (and a shark that passes through). Using the joystick the player is able to move his line left right and up and down in the water. When a fish is hooked, the line slowly comes up to the surface of the water. Pressing the fire button on the joystick reels in the fish faster. However, if both fishermen have fish hooked, only one person can reel theirs in (the one who hooked theirs first). The shark that roams the water will try to eat hooked fish before they surface.

The objective for both fishermen is to reach 99 pounds of fish first. There are six rows of fish; the top two rows have 2 lb. fish, the middle two rows have 4 lb. fish, and the two bottom rows have 6 lb. fish. The more valuable fish sit at the bottom, but they are harder to bring in as they run a higher risk of being eaten by the shark.

The game's two variants are simply single player and multi-player. In both games the objective is to reach 99 lb. of fish first.

"The future of gaming can be summed up in two words -- Pong and Joust." ...with these prophetic words on rec.games.video.classic, "Otter" planted the seeds for the game you see before you now. FlapPing, at its core, is an oldschool Pong Deathmatch... but with a "Flap" button. Each player flaps furiously to prevent the opponent from getting a ball past and scoring a point--first to 10 points win (3 points in a "poorlords" game).

FlapPing features two primary game variations, a "classic pong" mode which resembles the classic Pong arcade game, and "poorlords", where each player must defend a wall in a manner similar to the arcade game Warlords. You can play another human, or take on all the AI might of your Atari 2600. The Pterodactyl of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element to the gameplay!

FlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for his original homebrew game. Unfortunately, this name stepped on the Pong trademark owned by Atari, and in early 2005 he renamed the game top FlapPing so it could once again be sold in the AtariAge Store, complete with a new label and manual designed by Dave Exton.

MUST HAVE 2 PLAYERS TO PLAY! ~Rx

All offensive plays can be pass plays, except when a "punt" play is set.  Any player (including your opponent) is an eligible receiver. All passes must be made behind the "line of scrimmage" or the line on which the play started.

To punt, push the red controller button to program the "punt formation."  After the play starts, push the red button again and your Quarterback will kick the ball.  On a punt play only the defensive back can catch and return the ball.  If the ball is not caught, the computer will randomly select the yardage or lenghth of your kick.

In games 1 and 2, the path of the ball on a pass or punt can be "steered" after it leaves the Quarterback by using the Joystick. You can steer the ball left or right only.

SCORING

The offensive team scores a "touchdown" (seven points) by moving the ball past the opponent's goal line.  The defensive team can score a "safety" (two points) by tackling the opponent behind his goal line.  In addition, the defensive team gets the ball.

HANDICAP (Skill Switches)

When placed in the EXPERT position your players cannot move from side to side as quickly as in the NOVICE position.  This will give the more experienced player a handicap.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES &amp; TIME

In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation. 

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive. To succeed you will have to move fast, avoiding poisonous spiders, vampire bats and terrifying ghosts. Complete the job and the village will be safe forever. 

Fiend Foiling Objective 

You must build a barrier around FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER before he is completely energized. 

Player - Player must collect stones from the dungeons of Dr. Frankenstein's castle and bring them to the tower where he must construct the barrier around FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER. 

Frankenstein's Monster - A grotesque creature that is slowly being energized. Once completely energized, he will come alive and direct his fury on the helpless villagers. 

Power Probe - This device absorbs the energy released by an electrical storm and distributes it to FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER 

Ghoulish Creatures to Avoid 

Ghost - Whether real or mere illusion, these characters are equally terrifying. Contact one of them and you'll become mesmerized for a short time. 

Giant Tarantula - These creatures crawl freely throughout the castle. Avoid them or their venom will temporarily immobilize you. 

Spider - The dungeons of the castle are infested with these crafty pests. Without warning they'll drop upon you from the cracks in the stone ceiling. They seem determined to drive you into the deadly pool of acid. 

Bat - Lurking in the dark corners are scores of bloodthirsty vampire bats who will swarm you as you make your final assault on FRANKENSTEIN'S MOSNTER.

Freeway was one of the first titles released by Activision in their bold move to publish independent games for the Atari 2600. Both players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten-lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to "get to the other side." Every time a chicken gets across, a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, the chicken is forced back a bit, and in some modes is pushed all the way back to the bottom of the screen. The winner is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes allotted.

The chickens are only allowed to move up or down. The chicken sprite includes a limited bit of animation and the character clucks when struck by a car.

Comparisons are often made to Frogger, since that game also features crossing a street filled with moving vehicles. But the gameplay is different and both games were developed independently at the same time. Similarities did help sales when Frogger was popular in the arcades and a home version was not yet available.

Trivia:

Many early Activision games included contests. If a player scored over a certain number of points and sent in a photograph of the television screen, Activision would send the player a cloth patch for that particular game. For Freeway, the player needed to score 20 or more points on either Road 3 or Road 7 and was rewarded with a "Save The Chicken Foundation" patch featuring the Activision logo and the stylized "running chicken" image from the game package.

David Crane came up with the game during the SCES in Chicago, when he observed someone attempting to cross Lake Shore Drive on foot.

The goal of Frogger II: Threeedeep! is to maneuver each frog to a berth at the top of the screen. Once all of the berths are filled the player progresses to the next level. Unlike its predecessor, the game features three consecutive screens for each level rather than one screen per level, with berths at the top of each of the three screens that need to be filled.

The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one. To do this, each frog must avoid cars while crossing a busy road and navigate a river full of hazards. The skillful player may obtain many bonuses along the way.

The player starts with three frogs (lives). The player guides a frog which starts at the bottom of the screen. The lower half of the screen contains a road with motor vehicles, which in various versions include cars, trucks, buses,vans ,taxis, bicyclists, and/or motorcycles, speeding along it horizontally. The upper half of the screen consists of a river with logs, alligators, and turtles, all moving horizontally across the screen. The very top of the screen contains five "frog homes" which are the goals for each frog. Every level is timed; the player must act quickly to finish each level before the time expires.

The only player control is the joystick used to navigate the frog; each push in a direction causes the frog to hop once in that direction. On the bottom half of the screen, the player must successfully guide the frog between opposing lanes of trucks, cars, and other vehicles, to avoid becoming roadkill.

The middle of the screen, after the road, contains a median where the player must prepare to navigate the river.

By jumping on swiftly moving logs and the backs of turtles, the player can guide his or her frog safely to one of the empty lilypads. The player must avoid alligators, snakes, and otters in the river, but may catch bugs or escort a lady frog for bonuses. When all five frogs are directed home, the game progresses to the next, harder level.

There are many different ways to lose a life in this game, including...

1.Running into traffic or vehicles (Cars for example)
2.Running into snakes, otters or into an alligator's mouth or throat in the river
3.Jumping into the river's water
4.Jumping into a dock invaded by an alligator (on even levels)
5.Passing the dock
6.Staying on top of a diving turtle too extendedly
7.Running off the screen by being idle on a top of a log or turtle too long
8.Jumping into a dock already occupied by a frog
9.Running out of time before docking
10.Jumping on a dog

    <desc>
The history behind Frog Pond is a little hazy, it's either a victim of bad timing or of management/programmer dispute.  The premise behind Frog pond is simple, you control a frog who must try and catch various insects with its tongue in a race to see how many points you can score.  The game subject and total lack of difficulty almost guarantee that it was to going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds.  The problem with children's games is that they're really not alot of fun for adults to play, and Frog Pond is no exception. 

If Frog Pond looks familiar to you it's probably because it's an almost exact copy of Mattel's Frog Bog, which was released for the 2600 as Frogs and Flies under the M-Network label.  According to Nick Turner, this is a completely coincidence and neither company had any idea what the other had been working on.  According to Nick he wanted to add more options and gameplay to the game, expanding it to 8K.  Atari wasn't keen on spending the extra money on more memory for a children's game, and refused to allocate the extra 4K.  Frog Pond was shelved and Nick left Atari shortly afterwards.

As you might expect the gameplay is very simple.  Every time you press the fire button, your frog jumps and shoots out his tongue.  If your tongue hits an insect you score points and your frog gets a pleasant snack.  The are several different insects to catch, which are worth varying amounts of points.

While the larger insects are slightly faster than the smaller ones, they still don't put up much of fight.  However if you take too long to grab your bug he'll fly away.  If you miss six insects the sun sets and the games ends. 

Frog Pond sports four different game variations.  Games one and three are one player variations, while games two and four are two player variations.  The only difference between the two variations is the number of insects you are allowed to miss (games 3 and 4 allow more misses).  The difficulty switches can be used to control the length of your frogs tongue (A=short, B=long).  

Even with two difficulty levels Frog Pond never really gets very exciting.  It lacks the difficulty and variety that makes players want to come back for more.  Had Atari allocated the extra memory, Frog Pond probably would have been a decent seller (at least with the kids).  Unfortunately Frog Pond is now just another painful reminder of the managerial incompetence that ultimately brought down America's first video game company.

In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.

Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen - the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a "The End" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.

There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water - in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.

Playing as a lone soldier, the player's ultimate objective is to lob a hand grenade into the enemy's fort by first fighting off infantry units, then battling an armada of tanks before finally reaching the opponent's compound.

The player begins with two weapons: a pistol and grenades. The ammunition supply for both items is unlimited, so there is no need to acquire ammunition during gameplay. Once the player has advanced far enough into enemy territory, there's a "tank warfare" stage in which the player commandeers tanks to fight off the enemy.

There are two types of tanks available: a light tank armed with a machine gun and a heavy tank armed with a cannon. The light tank is more nimble, but can be easily destroyed by the enemy. The heavy tank is slower, but can sustain one hit from any tank. Once the damaged tank is evacuated, the player can jump back in and resume normal operation without any deadly consequence. If a heavy tank is by struck another mortar round, it will be destroyed. With either type of tank, the player must exit the vehicle within a few seconds of being struck by a fatal shot. The tank quickly explodes, and if the player is still occupying it, they lose a life.

The tank battle continues up until the player reaches the enemy's fort. The fort is a brick-barricaded tank which fires mortar rounds while the player attempts to take it out. In order to destroy this tank, the player must toss a grenade over the brick barricade. This requires them to be on foot instead of manning a tank. Once the player has successfully lobbed a grenade into the tank fortress, the tank will explode and an enemy soldier will wave the white flag, signaling surrender. The game then starts over with the infantry level, but enemy soldiers become much quicker and deadlier in successive rounds.

Pioneering Game: 

Front Line was one of the first video games to feature a ground combat theme. Most video games in the early '80s centered around battling aliens in space (e.g. Space Invaders, Galaxian), eating up dots (e.g. Pac Man and its descendants), or shooting centipedes (e.g. Centipede, Millipede). Military-themed video games before Front Line usually involved vehicular combat, such as tanks or naval vessels, but did not include infantry in its gameplay. Front Line was therefore a pioneering title in the now-popular military gaming genre.

The object of the game is to help Frostbite Bailey build igloos by jumping on floating blocks of ice, while trying to avoid deadly hazards like clams, snowgeese, Alaskan king crab, grizzly polar bears, and the rapidly dropping temperature.

Description:

The game depicts a polar scenery. Bottom two thirds of the screen are covered by a mass of water with four rows of ice blocks floating horizontally. The player moves by jumping from one row to another while trying to avoid various kinds of foes including crabs and birds. There are also fish which grant extra points.

On the top of the screen is the shore where the player must build the Igloo. On later levels there is also a polar bear walking around on the shore which must be avoided.

The game levels alternate between large ice blocks and little ice pieces. The levels with the little pieces are actually easier, since one can walk left or right over them without falling in the water.

Each time the player jumps on a piece of ice in a row its color changes from white to blue and the player gets an ice block in the Igloo on the shore. The player has the ability to change the direction in which the ice is flowing by pressing the fire button, but that costs a piece of the Igloo.

After the player has jumped on all the pieces on the screen, they all turn back to white and one can jump on them again. When all the 15 ice blocks required for building the Igloo are gathered, the player has to get back to the shore and get inside it, thus proceeding to the next level. On every level the enemies and the ice blocks move slightly faster than in the previous level making the game more difficult.

Each level must be completed in 60 seconds. The faster the level is completed the more bonus points are awarded to the player.

Trivia:

The game manual included a chance to become an Arctic Architect, by achieving a suitably high score. By scoring 40,000 points or more, you could take a photo of the TV screen, showing the score and send it along to Activision. After verifying the score, you would receive an Arctic Architects emblem.

Funky Fish is a port of the 1981 arcade game by Sun Electronics. It was programmed by UA Ltd., the same company that programmed all the games for the Emerson Arcadia 2001. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) was never released commercially.

Funky Fish is available in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store and includes a professionally printed box, manual and label, with artwork created by Dave Exton.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by Space Invaders. As in the earlier game, Galaxian featured a horde of attacking aliens that exchanged shots with the player. In contrast to Space Invaders, however, Galaxian added an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make kamikaze-like dives at the player's ship.

The gameplay was relatively simple. Swarm after swarm of alien armies attacked the player's ship that moved left and right at the bottom of the screen. The ship could only fire sparingly by default, but rearmed instantly when an enemy was hit. The player would defeat one swarm, only to have it replaced by another more aggressive and challenging army in the next screen. A plain and repetitive starfield scrolled in the background.

1984 wasn't a good year for Atari or the video game industry in general.  In fact Atari was doing so poorly it was losing almost a million dollars a day!  Because of this Atari decided to stop developing games that it didn't think would sell in large numbers.  Once Atari was sold to the Tramiels they took a look at Garfield and decided they didn't want to pay the high royalties to Jim Davis and Steve Woita, so the game was canceled.  When Steve heard this he didn't take the news very well, but he had little time to protest as most of Atari's staff was laid off.  To make a long story short, Garfield was never finished.

While Atari may have thought Garfield had limited appeal, its obvious they didn't take the time to play the game.  Had they actually taken a close look at Garfield they would have discovered that while it may feature a well-known cartoon cat, it was actually a great side scrolling platform game (something the 2600 library was sorely lacking).  Even in its unfinished state, Garfield proves that the 2600 could do a multi-screened side scrolling game (and all this after only 2 months of programming!).  Too bad Atari didn't agree.

As you probably guessed, Garfield stars the lovable orange furball from the Sunday comics (no not Alf!).  Garfield is on a mission to find Nermal (wasn't he always trying to get AWAY from Nermal?), and to accomplish this mission he's going to have to cross five different action filled screens while keeping a looking out for the nefarious Odie!  The movement in Garfield is a bit strange, you don't move left or right with the joystick but by pressing the fire button to jump.  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but fits in well with the whole fence post idea.

According to Steve Garfield still needed about 2 to 3 months of work before it would be complete.  The final game was to have hundreds of screens and probably would have been the largest 2600 game to date (certainly one of the most ambitious in any case).  Garfield finally turned up when Jim Davis finally gave Steve permission to distribute the rom.  It's great to see large companies (in this case Paws inc.) finally give permission for ancient (but still copyrighted) games to be released so the public can enjoy them.  Now if only other companies would follow suit (Pink Panther anyone?).

The bank has loaned you $5,000 to start your own Ghostbusters franchise. Earn enough money busting ghosts before their dangerous energy emissions (PK energy) reach critical mass at 9999. Otherwise, your business will be foreclosed.

~From the Manual

While numerous Activision games were ported from the 2600 to computers, this game is actually a port of the Commodore 64 game by David Crane. Following the 1984 hit movie, the game stars the Ghostbusters who patrol the city trapping rampaging ghosts, taking them back to their headquarters, and finally facing the Stay-Puft marshmallow man. Dan Kitchen's port incorporates nearly all of the computer game's complex gameplay, although the graphics had to be stripped down a great deal. (Contributed by sdamon)

Ghost Manor is a survival horror game that was released by Xonox in 1983 for the Atari 2600 and the Vic-20. It was generally packaged in a double ended cartridge along with one of three other games in an effort to appeal to budget conscious buyers who would purchase two games for the price of one cartridge. There was also a more limited release of single ended cartridges containing Ghost Manor by itself. The double ended cartridges paired Ghost Manor with the platform game Spike's Peak, the fighting game Chuck Norris Superkicks, or a strategy game called Artillery Duel.[1]

Characters:

Friendly characters:

 - Girl: Playable on both the 2600 and the 7800, she sets out to rescue the boy from Ghost Manor. Set the 2600's TV Type switch to "Color" to play as the Girl.

 - Boy: Playable on the 2600 only, he sets out to rescue the girl from Ghost Manor. Set the 2600's TV Type Switch to "B/W" to play as the Boy. Atari 7800 users will not be able to play as the Boy, since the 7800 does not have a TV Type switch.

Neutral Characters:

 - Bones: A invincible skeleton in the graveyard who will give you spears for use at the Gate.

 - Rainbow Ghost: A ghost who is otherwise identical to Bones.

Enemies:

 - Chopping Mummy: Found in the game's second stage, the Chopping Mummy is the leader of the Spooks at the Gate. He will try to stop the Boy or Girl from entering Ghost Manor. The Chopping Mummy is invincible until all of the Spooks are defeated. Contact with the Chopping Mummy's blade ends the game instantly.

 - Spooks: Any of the seven beings flying around the Gate. They consist of two green scorpions, two white skulls, and three black bats. Defeat them using your Spears.

 - Dracula: The sinister being who guards the Prison (and your friend) in the game's final stage. He is vulnerable only to the Crosses you find in the game. Contact with Dracula is lethal to your character.

Defend and fire!  That's your mission in this battle between the G.I. Joes and their archenemy Cobra!  Cobra, an evil organization, determined to take over the world, now slithers back and forth over the G.I. Joe training camp in the form of a giant cobra snake.  And that means danger for the G.I. Joe recruits running for shelter between the training building and headquarters.

You see, the Cobra is trying to capture them by shooting venom from its fangs and laser beams from its eyes.  If hit by venom, a recruit is "vaporized" until he materializes again...at Cobra Headquarters!  And if he's hie by a laser beam, he's directly "beamed up!" 

But you as G.I. Joe can protect the recruits with your atomic-powered energy shield.  You as G.I. Joe can destroy the Cobra with your missile-firing guns.  But you must be quick with your wits and deadly with your aim.  It's a mission for only a highly trained commando like G.I. Joe--and you.

~From the Manual

The color label version of G.I. Joe Cobra Strike is also fancier than its gray counterpart. It seems to be a bit harder to find, and is more desirable to collectors.

Unrefined sugar, flour, ginger and heat have combined magically to produce consciousness and mobility in a delicious culinary confection. You, a Gingerbread Man, find yourself baking in a gas-fired oven, and you must find a way out! Gingerbread Man is based loosely on the popular children's story of the same name. And although this game is appropriate for children, it's not child's play!

In Gingerbread Man you must fight your way through 20 levels consisting of five unique game-play screens, facing a variety of obstacles and challenges in order to survive! In the first level you begin in a hot oven where you must escape before being cooked alive! Once you break free from the oven, you find yourself in the dining room where you need to collect all of the balloons and float up to the roof through the chimney. Now that you're on the roof you must build a bridge to a nearby tree while fighting off cats and birds that want you for a tasty treat! Once in the tree, you need to evade all the dangerous creatures in the forest (will you ever get a break?) And if you do escape the forest, you enter a cave where you must fight off your most fearsome enemy yet!

Once you defeat the boss, to your dismay you are captured again and put back in the oven too cook some more, and this time the heat has been turned up! Will you ever escape? Can you battle through 19 levels to have your chance to out-fox the final boss and win your freedom?

Gingerbread Man includes three game variations:

- Selection 1 is the default.

- Selection 2 is expert mode.

- Selection 3 is a special mode for children.

Night has fallen over the North Pole and you are on guard duty. A mysterious Aquafreze craft glows in the sky and you realize the beings directing the craft are not friendly, when they begin dropping what appear to be large ice blocks, which in reality are semi-intelligent invasion devices. These devices are attempting to build a protective wall to shield the invaders' advance. You perceive the danger to the Earth if the wall is completed. You quickly draw your heat ray pistol and begin Earth's final defense.

As you desperately melt the invasion devices, you realize that as you try to run under the ice wall, your bio-chemical reactions are inhibited, which causes you to slow down.

When you were sent to polar station Freedom, you thought a cold war was propaganda; how wrong you were. Can you hold out till the sun comes up?

Go Fish! is an original game loosely based on the Intellivision game Shark! Shark! - you are a wee fish and, to survive, you must eat other, smaller fish to grow. But watch out for the shark, as he's also on the hunt for food and you could be his next meal! Go Fish! features extensive, continuously-playing music (with an option to turn it off for those who'd rather do their fishing in quiet), as well as a two-player battle mode.

Go Fish! is one of the first homebrew games to support Richard Hutchinson's AtariVox. Go Fish! takes advantage of the AtariVox to save your high score, which is retained when you turn your Atari 2600 off. When you come back later to play Go Fish! and power on your 2600, your previous high score will be restored!

Programmer Bob Montgomery teamed up with AtariAge to sponsor a contest to create original artwork for Go Fish!

This game features a simplified type of golf. The area of the hole is rendered in light green, all areas outside the hole are rendered in a medium blue. On the larger holes the green is rendered as a dark green hole circle with the hole near the center. There are several obstacles that can appear, including trees, sand traps, and water features.

On difficulty A, balls that go out of bounds stay there and must be hit back in; on difficulty B, the balls stick to the edge of the area. Balls hit near the water can soar over it, or if they land into the water, the ball is placed back where the shot was taken. Balls hit into sand traps will stick to the sides of the traps, and it takes a more powerful swing to free the ball.

The player only uses one club  the amount of time the fire button is held down determines how much power the ball will be hit with, and how far it will go. The player's golfer can be moved anywhere on the field, with his golf club always facing the ball.

On the larger hole the goal is to hit the ball on to the green. Once the player reaches the green, the game will zoom in on the green. The green is rendered as a light green circle, with a black dot as the actual hole. Once the ball reaches a hole, the player moves on to the next hole.

The player controls a farmer with a shovel who must protect his three carrots from the gopher. The gopher tunnels left and right and up to the surface. When he makes a hole to the surface he will attempt to steal a carrot. The farmer must hit the gopher to send him back underground or fill in the holes to prevent him from reaching the surface. If gopher has taken any of the three carrots, a pelican will occasionally fly overhead and drop a seed which, if the farmer catches it, he can plant it in the place of the missing carrot. The longer the game, the faster the gopher gets. The game ends when the gopher successfully removes all three carrots.

Gorf's objective is simply to destroy all enemies. The player controls a spaceship that can move slowly left, right, up and down. (Its vertical movement is limited to the lower one-third of the screen.) The ship can fire a single shot (called a "quark laser" in this game), which travels slowly up the screen. Unlike similar games, where the player cannot fire again until their existing shot has disappeared, the player can "re-fire" their laser at any time, causing their existing shot to disappear immediately (if it hasn't already).

Grand Prix is a typical early Activision title: colorful graphics and solid, fun gameplay. In what is possibly the simplest racing game ever made, it is your job to race to the finish line in as little time as possible, all the while swooping in and around other cars on the track. If that wasn't bad enough, oil spots litter the track's final stretch, making the end of the race quite treacherous. Grand Prix was one of the first games that Activision awarded a patch if you were able to beat a beat a certain time on one of the four tracks and send in a picture of your accomplishment.

In the game, the player controls a small blue spacecraft. The game starts in a fictional solar system with several planets to explore. If the player moves his ship into a planet, he will be taken to a side-view landscape. Unlike many other shooting games, gravity plays a fair part in Gravitar: the ship will be pulled slowly to the deadly star in the overworld, and downward in the side-view levels.

CAST OF CHARACTERS

BILLY

Billy is a nice young fellow who works in a bank. His life is fairly ordinary until his dad gives him a Mogwai for Christmas. Then the extraordinary happens!

MOGWAI

The Mogwai is a cute and cuddly animal that Billy's dad discovers in a Hong Kong junk store. If not properly cared for, the Mogwai can turn into something grim! Rules for the care of Mogwai:

1. Keep them away from water. Don't ever get them wet. Water makes them multiply.

2. Keep them out of light. They hate bright light. It will kill them.

3. But the most important thing, the thing you must never forget, is that no matter how much they cry, no matter how much they beg, never, NEVER feed them after midnight. If you do, they'll hatch into Gremlins!

GREMLIN

The Gremlin has an evil glint in his eyes. He causes problems wherever he goes.  He's mischievous -- in fact, he's dangerous!

Gunfight is the first release from Manuel Polik and is heavily inspired by the 1975 Midway arcade game Gun Fight. Gunfight features eight-way movement with the following gameplay modes:

 - Standard Duel: The first player to score 7 points wins
 - Sixshooter Duel: The first player to score 7 points wins
 - Escape Scenario: The left player wins when scoring _once_! The right player wins when surviving 99 time units.
 - Target Shooting: The first player to score 77 points wins. Hitting a target scores 1 point. Hitting the opponent scores 5 points.

AtariAge sponsored a contest to see who could create the best label for Gunfight. The winner was David Exton and you can view his winning entry here! Gunfight is available in cartridge form in the AtariAge Store, complete with David Exton's winning label and a beautiful eight-page, full-color manual.

The gameplay is very similar to that of Galaga but with an added twist: the game is presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player's ship facing 'into' the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle - essentially, Gyruss was Galaga mapped onto a Tempest-like cylinder. This gameplay style is called a tube shooter, and Gyruss is one of the very few examples that exist. The familiar scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games was arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving very fast through space.

The majority of enemies are other spaceships, all of which must be destroyed before a level is completed. They appear either from the centre of the screen or from one of the edges, and move in swirling patterns. They can shoot the player's ship or destroy it by contact. They hover near the centre of the screen after completing their deployment pattern, and occasionally fly outwards and shoot at the player. If they are not destroyed by the player, the enemy ships gradually fly away one by one.

This is what Pac-man should have been on the VCS. As close to the arcade as you are probably going to get, this game features both the original Pac-man and the later Pac-man Plus. Both arcade games are superbly recreated here.
 
What's New:

Nukey Shay took the original Pesco game and completely overhauled the source, leaving no stones unturned. All sprites have been changed to resemble Pac-man characters. The playfield has been modified to resemble the original Pac-man maze. All game sounds and colors have been changed to more closely resemble the Pac-man arcade. For a complete list of changes and to follow the progress of this hack from start to finish, please visit this thread in the AtariAge Hacks Forum.

Trivia:

As Wizard Video was liquidating their inventory and trying to minimize costs, many copies of Halloween were sold with no label. The word "Halloween" is simply written across the cartridge in black marker. The label version is more sought after by collectors, but it is unclear which version is more rare.

Your object? To complete the Hangman Word within eleven incorrect letter guesses. Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 are one-player games in which one player competes against himself and the computer. During two-player games of Game 5, 6, 7 and 8, two players compete to guess the Hangman Word first within eleven incorrect guesses.

Let's face it, pornographic games aren't generally known for their plot.  Usually there's a flimsy excuse for a character to have sex with multiple women with a bit of danger thrown in for good measure, but that's about all.  That being said, usually the plots make some sort of sense (albiet a bit simplistic or contrived).  The same can't be said about Harem, which may just be the most surreal pornographic game to ever grace the 2600. 

What do mystery snipers, dragons, and gargoyles all have in common?  If you said elements of a good porno game, then you're probably smoking the same stuff that the developer of this game was.  Yes, you read that right.  Your character must contend with snipers, dragons, poisonous snake women, and gargoyles all in an attempt to get laid.  Surely there must be an easier way? 

Your character starts at the lower left of a multi-tiered screen and must make his way to the beautiful(?) woman to the right, however you'll soon find out that someone is out to stop your stud monkey conquests at all costs.  The first obstacle you'll encounter takes the form of a sniper hiding in a bush.  Why would a sniper be hiding in a bush just to shoot you in the buttocks?  Why not?  As you approach the bush a bullet will fly out in your direction, killing you if it makes contact.  To get past the sniper, simply run away a few times until he has to reload (the bullets will stop) and then run past the bush.  Once you're past the bush, you can run into your lady's loving arms and explore a different kind of bush?

Each time you make it to one of the women, you will start the "humping" mini-game.  Your goal here is to meet her thrusts by pushing right every time she thrusts her pelvis.  If you're successful in your timing you will score a point and a tone will sound.  Each time you score a point, the tone will get higher and higher indicating that danger is approaching.  If you continue to "score" past a certain point (around 8 or so points) your woman will appear to explode and you will fall into a pit and die (I guess you were a little too much for her).  To avoid this, make sure you push the button to escape before this happens.  If you manage to score 69 points you will earn an extra life.

The next obstacle you must face comes in the form of a river.  While conceptually this is the easiest obstacle to clear, the iffy collision detection makes it much more difficult than it should be.  To clear the river, simply run towards to it and push the button when your back foot is on the edge of the bank (not your front foot).  Assuming you timed it right, you will go flying over the river and meet yet another woman.  You know what to do?

After you've scored as many points as you dare, you will be taken to the next area of the screen.  Here you must run past a dangerous fire breathing dragon, which is much more difficult than it sounds.  The trick to getting past the dragon is to wait for it to breathe fire, then quickly run by him.  Once you're past the dragon you'll undoubtedly notice the large pit ahead of you.  Here you must wait for the snake to change into a woman and then quickly drop down into the pit to "do the deed".  The timing on this is rather tricky as you can't simply wait around for the snake to change because the dragon is chasing you.  If you manage to time it just right and find the woman, you'll be taken to the last area of the game.

In this final area you must chase down the woman running around the top of the castle as they aren't just going to wait around for you anymore.  As you chase your dream date, you'll notice that ugly little faces appear to be puking on you.  These are actually gargoyles, and they're trying to dump lava on you.  The gargoyles are easily avoided by stopping when they breathe fire, and since there are no other dangers on this level, you're free to stop and start the pursuit at will.  Each time you catch the woman you can score a few points in the standard manner, but she'll run away again and the chase continues?

For a porno game, Harem is actually pretty good.  The gameplay is varied, and the graphics are respectable.  However the gameplay is rather difficult at times, and needs a bit of polish here and there.  The other main problem with Harem is that the game gets old after only a short time.  The thrill of being able to hump your lady can only entertain for so long, and once that bit of fun is gone the frustrating obstacles start to become more and more annoying than fun.  Still, Harem is much more refined than the schlock that companies like Playaround were putting out around the same time.  So if you're horny and the 2600 is the only game system you own, give Harem a try.  You might actually find yourself having a good time...

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

This game was one of the first home video games to feature scrolling graphics and a multi-level playing field, and has been identified as one of the earliest examples of the survival horror genre by a GameSpy article.

The house has three floors and a basement. The player's character may pick up only one of three items at a time (a key to open doors, a sceptre to ward off evil spirits, or the urn) and must avoid a bat, a tarantula, and the ghost of Mr. Graves himself. If the player is hit by the monsters nine times, the game ends. If the player escapes the house with the urn, the player wins.

The items (and house layout in higher difficulties) can only be seen when the player uses the 'fire' button on the joystick to light a match, illuminating a small radius directly around his character; this can be done an infinite number of times, although the match only lasts for a limited amount of time before being snuffed out. If a monster enters the same room as the player, a howling wind from the monster will blow out any lit match.

Haunted House has a total of nine different levels which make the game more challenging; in particular, later difficulty levels make the walls of the house itself invisible unless the player lights a match.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

H.E.R.O., supposedly meaning "Helicopter Equipped Rescue Operation" (or "Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation", "Human Extraction and Rescue Operation"), is a platform-style action game, set in a system of underground mines.

The player's character (known as Roderick Hero according to the game inlay) in H.E.R.O. is a rescue worker with a small helicopter-type backpack, enabling him to fly around the underground mine shafts and caverns. For defense, the character is equipped with a laser beam and a finite supply of sticks of dynamite.

The object of each level is to rescue a trapped mine worker at the extreme end of the mine shaft within a time limit. Dangers along the way include various cave-dwelling animals (such as bats, snakes, spiders and even butterflies) and on later levels, some kind of red ore (magma, on the 8-bit systems) which is lethal to the touch, and water at the bottom of the shaft (where appears a tentacle from an unknown animal) .

Holey Moley is an unreleased prototype written by Bob Polaro. The game was originally programmed back in 1983, but was never commercially released due to ownership changes at Atari. This game requires the use of the Kid's Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.

A version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid's Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. You can purchase a copy of Holey Moley by visiting Atari2600.com.

MUST HAVE 2 PLAYERS TO PLAY! ~Rx


Play HOME RUN just as you would play baseball. The left or blue player is the "visiting team" and is the first to bat. The pitcher-outfielder pitches the ball. Three _strikes_ (either swinging or pitched) are an out; four balls (any pitch not struck at that is NOT over the plate) are a walk and the batter advances to first base.

If the pitcher hits the batter (and the batter does not strike at the pitch, or the pitch does not pass over Home Plate) the batter will advance to first base.

If the batter hits the ball, the outfielder(s) can catch the ball and make a putout by touching first base ahead of the runner or by tagging the runner. If there are other runners on base, a putout can be made by tagging any runner or, if the runner is in a "force play", by touching the base in front of that runner. With practice, doubleplays (two outs on one pitched ball) can be made with ease.

Careful now, the Human Cannonball is counting on you to make your calculations accurately. Otherwise he'll end up flat as a pancake and you'll end up with 0 points or a miss to show for it! The objective of this game is to shoot the man out of the cannon and into the water tower. To accomplish this, you must consider the following variables: 

The angle of the cannon (establishes the line or arc of trajectory the man follows after being shot from the can- non). 

The speed (MPH) at which the man travels after being shot from the cannon. 

The distance between the cannon and the water tower. 

These variables are set by you and/or the computer, depending on the game you're playing. In some games, the cannon position remains fixed throughout the game. There are 8 game variations in all. Each game variation contains a one- and a two-player version.

"For though he was gentle and kind, it was Quasimodo's crime to have been born hideously deformed. But one day his heart would prove to be a thing of rare beauty. She was Esmerelda. The victim of a coward's jealous rage, she is unjustly convicted of a crime she didn't commit. Her sentence is death by hanging. Only one man can save her --Quasimodo." Victor Hugo

Hunchy II is a sequel to the 1982 classic arcade game Hunch Back which is loosely based on the novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1831) by Victor Hugo. Your task is to guide the hunchbacked Quasimodo in his quest to rescue the gypsy girl Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. To succeed, you must collect all of the bells in each cathedral room. You must also avoid any incoming missiles and the fearsome cathedral guards. Hunchy II contains 14 levels of increasing difficulty.

Hunchy II can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

Ice Hockey is a game of two-on-two ice hockey. One player on each team is the goalie, and the other plays offensive (although, the goalie is not confined to the goal). As in the real sport, the object of the game is to take control of the puck and shoot it into the opposing goal to score points. When the puck is in player control, it moves left and right along the blade of the hockey stick. The puck can be shot at any of 32 angles, depending on the position of the puck when it's shot.

Human players take control of the skater in control of (or closest to) the puck. The puck can be stolen from its holder; shots can also be blocked by the blade of the hockey stick.

INCOMING! is a new artillery duel game by Ben Larson. The set up is simple, You control a cannon on one side of the screen and the enemy appears on the other. Take turns shooting at each other and the first one to get a hit receives a point.

Of course it's not that simple. This battle take place in a canyon that is built randomly for each level. You also have to take into account the direction and speed of the wind. You control the elevation and power of your shot.

The game was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale October 1977. Sears Telegames later released Indy 500 as Race; no changes were made to the gameplay.

This video car racing game  ostensibly named after the Indianapolis 500  offered a number of games (listed below).

Included with each game was a set of two driving controllers, which were identical in appearance to the paddle controller except they could rotate continuously.

Game variations among the racing games included:

Standardized racing games: Players could opt to race against the clock or complete 25 laps around the course the soonest. A number of courses were featured (either dry or "ice-covered").

Crash and Score: Players competed  either against each other or a computer opponent  to crash into a white square randomly placed on the track. The square was moved whenever one player crashed into it.

Tag: Each player controlled a car. One was blinking and had to avoid being struck by the other car (which was "it").

Ice Race: Standardized racing, but with a race course that was supposed to be covered in ice, and thus behaved as if it were slippery.

Options:

Each game allowed the player to determine the following:

Whether the game had a time limit or continued until a certain score was reached.

The number of players (one or two). In one-player games, the player competed against a computer opponent.

INV+ is an original take of the arcade classic Space Invaders for the 2600 and was a collaborative effort between Erik Mooney and Piero Cavina. This is the only version of Space Invaders for the 2600 to feature 11 invaders per row, matching the arcade game in this regard. INV+ also features a simultaneous two-player mode.

INV+ is the successor to INV, with several improvements over the original game:

 - Scoring more closely matches the original arcade game
 - PAL support has been added
 - Added an Invisible Invaders mode
 - Player death sequence improved and animated
 - Hidden easter egg added
 - New, full-color manual
 - Several bugs were fixed

Several additional improvements were made in addition to the above. You can read the complete list of changes here.

INV+ can be purchased from the AtariAge Store, featuring an original and colorful label created by Dave Exton, as well as a full-color manual. If you're a Space Invaders fan, don't miss out on this fast-paced, original title for the 2600!

Perhaps one of Atari's lesser known arcade games, I, Robot was ahead of its time. This is probably the first arcade game to use 3-D filled polygons, placing the player in a surreal universe of strange landscapes and sounds. You play the role of "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984" and must clear each level of the red tiled polygons. Unfortunately, the game didn't go over very well with gamers and was a failure in arcades.

Atari expected this game to be a huge success in the arcades, as a good number of their previous original concepts did quite well. Because of this, Atari was developing a 2600 version of the game in parallel with the arcade game. However, once it was obvious that the coin-op was not going to be a commercial success, Atari dropped development of the 2600 version.

The game was far enough along in development that box artwork and labels had already been created for the game. It also appears that Atari was going to release the game in Europe, as we have scans for two different box styles (presumably NTSC and PAL). We were even fortunate enough to secure a dump of the prototype cartridge, which you can download here. Don't get your hopes up too much, though, as it looks like there was still a lot of work remaining to be done.

Given the complexity of the arcade game, it's amazing that Atari would even attempt to reproduce this game on the Atari 2600. But by this time Atari's programmers had been pulling off some impressive feats on the 2600, games that just a few years earlier would have been thought impossible to do. Crystal Castles, Gravitar, Joust, Millipede, Ms. Pac-Man, and Stargate are all examples of previous arcade conversions that made the transition to the 2600 remarkably well.

To play the game, download the binary image here. You'll also need to download a 2600 emulator if you don't already have one. For those of you with the means to play the game on a real 2600 (via a Cuttle Cart or other means), the game can use one or two joysticks. If you use a single joystick, you must hold down the joystick button to change your view (the arcade game has a second button dedicated for this purpose). If you have a second joystick plugged into the second controller port, moving any direction on the stick or pressing the button will cause your view to shift.

Special thanks to Sasche Becker and Joe Grand for helping us to bring this long-lost game to light.

Here's an oddity, an unreleased 2600 game that's a port of an unreleased game (an unreleased 8-bit port exists as well).  It appears that although Sega developed Ixion for multiple platforms, they never released it for anything. For those who don't know, Ixion was a character from Greek mythology.  Ixion was the son the Phlegyas, descendent of Ares, and king of the Lapiths in Thessaly.  He is also the first mortal to shed kindred blood.  To punish him, Zeus bound Ixion to a winged wheel, which revolved in the air in all directions for all eternity.  What does a flying out of control wheel have to do with this game?  Read on to found out!

Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else (this is a refreshing change from all the 'me too' clone games in the 2600 library).  The goal of the game is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before time runs out.  This is strangely reminiscent of many of the games put out by Universal, where the player would have spell out the word Bonus by grabbing letters that would appear around the screen.  The game screen consists of a giant grid of 110 squares on which your ship (which looks like a small tank) can travel.  Your ship cannot travel over areas where squares are missing.  At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, to get around easier you will need to reveal the missing squares.  

Reveling the missing squares is fairly simple, one simply has to move the brown sphere over an empty square.  The sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it.  This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies as it goes (hence the reference to Ixion's flying wheel).  After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares.  Learning how to move the sphere to where you want to go is the key to mastering Ixion.

Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship.  Unfortunately in addition to your ship their shots also destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse.  Thankfully the drones appear to be bound by the same rules about traveling over tiles that you are, so there is no unfair advantage.  Aside from using the sphere as a weapon, your ship is armed with a powerful cannon that shoots three bullets and can be aimed in eight directions and bounce off walls.  Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.  Also make sure you keep an eye on the timer (represented by a drone slowly moving towards your reserve ships).  If the drone makes it to your reserve ships before you've spelled Ixion, you will lose a life.  This timer starts to move at amazing speed on the higher levels, so don't delay in hunting down those letters! 

After each level you will be treated to a small bonus round.  In these rounds the screen starts out without any tiles present, but there are two spheres.  Your goal on this screen is quickly reveal as many tiles as you can before the timer runs out.  Since there are no squares visible at the start of the round you will only be able to shoot the spheres at first, however as more squares are reveled you can start bumping the sphere to move it around even more.    If you are able to reveal all the squares (a very difficult feat) you will receive a large bonus.  There does not appear to be a penalty for not revealing all the squares (other than your wounded pride of course)

Although Ixion starts off easy, the higher rounds are very intense.  Each successive round starts off with less squares visible at the start, and they're usually missing from the worst possible places.  The sphere also will get placed in harder to reach locations, making it difficult to grab at the start of the round.  The enemies begin to shoot faster and more often, and will respawn much faster after they are destroyed.  In the higher rounds it is not uncommon to destroy more squares than you reveal, simply by destroying the rapidly respawning drones.

The graphics for Ixion are top notch, very impressive for the time in which is was created.  There is little, if any, flicker, and the sound effects get the job done (be sure to check out the warning sound that plays when running out of time, which appears to have been ripped off from Pac-Man).  The timer and score counter at the bottom of the screen look very similar to those used in Thunderground, this may mean that they had the same programmer or that the programmer simply borrowed code.  

It is unknown why Ixion was never released, but it was around this time that Sega Enterprises (the American arm of Sega) was sold to Bally.  After this sale, all of Sega's 2600 titles were Bally Midway arcade games (Tapper, Spy Hunter, and Up n Down).  It may have been felt that only well known arcade game would sell well enough in the overly competitive 2600 market, or perhaps Ixion simply got lost in the transition shuffle?  Whatever the reason, the 2600 world was robbed of one of one of the most original and entertaining titles to grace the console.

Players control the British spy James Bond's multi-purpose vehicle that can travel both land and sea. Players can shoot lasers upward towards aerial opponents or bullets downwards at other enemies. They must also jump over obstacles and dodge enemy attacks.

There are four missions, each based on a Bond movie. The missions are: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Before each mission begins, the game displays its name, lives remaining, the vehicle, and a message from M stating, "Good luck, Mr. Bond." Each mission has a specific goal, with various checkpoints throughout.

When a player's last life is lost, M bids James goodbye, and the final score is shown.

Grab your joystick and become "Bruce" the man eating Shark!! 

Amity Island has long been known for its clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches. But in recent days, a cloud has appeared on the horizon of this beautiful resort community - a cloud in the shape of a killer shark.

Object of the Game:

Try to eliminate as many victims as possible before your Feed Time runs out.

Scoring: 

For each victim you eat, you will receive 1,000 points.

How to Play:

The player controls Bruce the Shark.  Computer-controlled victims thrash in terror as you pursue them.  Beware of the obstacles in the water  buoys and oil slicks also watch out Quint is shooting harpoons at you and he has also placed barrels in the water to try and stop you.  At the top of the screen is the number of lives you have left and a gauge indicating the amount of feeding time left.  At the bottom of the screen is the score display.

Using your joystick, move The Shark in the desired direction and try to overtake your victim.  When you're close enough, press the joystick button once to start munching and eat your victims. Constant munching drains your feed time so be sure you are in range before you press the button.  Jaws starts the game with three lives.

BONUS: Extra feed time is awarded every 5,000 points.

You're on the road with Journey, one of the world's hottest rock groups. A spectacular performance has just ended. Now it's up to you to guide each Journey Band Member past hordes of Love-Crazed Groupies, Sneaky Photographers, and Shifty-Eyed Promoters to the safety of the Journey Escape Vehicle in time to make the next concert. Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you!

~From the Manual

Gameplay:

The player must lead the band members to their "Scarab Escape Vehicle" (as featured on the cover) and protect the concert cash from crazy groupies, sneaky photographers, stage barriers and dishonest promoters. Assisting the player are roadies, which provided short periods of immunity to obstacles, and The Manager, inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid Man, which allowed the player to move to the Scarab completely unhindered. The screen scrolls vertically non-stop, although the speed can be controlled; the player moves side to side to dodge the aforementioned obstacles.

Music:

Despite the title, the song "Escape" is not featured in the game; the intro tune is an excerpt from "Don't Stop Believin'", which is also on the same album. The in-game music, however, appears to be an original tune, rather than based on a Journey song.

The player controls a knight armed with a lance, mounted on either an ostrich (player 1) or a stork (player 2), who battles waves of computer-controlled enemy knights mounted on giant buzzards. These knights have three different speed and agility levels. The game screen is static; its only features are five platforms hanging in mid-air (some wrapping around the screen), the ground, and a pit of lava beneath.

The simplicity of its controls are a factor in the game's wide appeal. A joystick moves left and right, and a "Flap" button flaps the mount's wings once. Pressing "Flap" in rapid succession will produce a gain in altitude until simulated gravity drags the mount downward.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The gameplay of Jr. Pac-Man is largely identical to that of its predecessors, with a few differences. The maze is now two times the width of the display, and a virtual camera pans left and right along the maze to follow Jr. Pac-Man, sometimes resulting in the ghosts being off-screen. A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and unlike previous Pac-Man games, none of the mazes have tunnels that wrap from one side of the screen to the other.

As in prior games, bonus prizes appear in each level. These prizes were called fruits in Pac-Man, but none of the prizes in this game are fruits. Similar to Ms. Pac-Man, prizes appear in the middle of the maze and bounce around for a time, but as a prize encounters dots, it changes them into larger dots that slow Jr. Pac-Man down more than regular dots but are worth more points. If not eaten beforehand, a prize self-destructs when it encounters an energizer (also known as a power pellet) and destroys them both.

There are also a few cosmetic differences: The main character is Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie); Clyde, the orange ghost, is now called Tim; and the game's graphics and sound have been updated, including a lower-case anti-aliased font for scores and game text. The game's intermissions center around the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum (apparently the daughter of Blinky).

Like Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, Jr. Pac-Man has a kill screen: when the 146th screen is reached, the maze is invisible and there are no dots to eat, effectively preventing the player from completing the level.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES &amp; SHORT STAGES

The player controls a jungle explorer who sports a pith helmet and a safari suit. The player must rescue his girl from a tribe of hungry cannibals. To do this, he must swing from vine to vine, survive a crocodile-infested river, jump or duck falling rocks rolling downhill, and release the girl before she "takes a dip" in the boiling cauldron.

History:

Jungle Hunt was originally called Jungle King but Jungle King's prototype was called Jungle Boy. In these earlier versions the playable character was a bare-chested man with a loincloth who resembled Tarzan. Taito was sued by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate for copyright infringement for using the character's likeness. 

In Jungle Hunt, the following changes were made to the game:

 - The character was replaced with a jungle explorer wearing a pith helmet and safari outfit.

 - In the first scene, ropes replace the vines as the objects that the player has to swing on.

 - The Tarzan yell was removed and cannot be heard throughout the game.

 - Taito Brazil (Taito do Brasil) released a version of the game in Brazil in 1983 under the title 'Jungle Hunt' which included the bare-chested character and the Tarzan yell.

Yet another variant of the game was called Pirate Pete. Gameplay in this version was identical to Jungle Hunt but the character was replaced with a pirate (complete with eye patch) and the levels had a pirate theme.

Jess Ragan's latest 2600 hack is a conversion of Jungle King, the original version of Jungle Hunt that Taito was forced to change after the estate of Edgar Rice Burrows threatened a lawsuit. After Jess' changes, the game is once again the way the designers had intended it. It's so close to the arcade original that the jungle hero's hair even changes color from round to round!
 
What's New:

Player sprite has been changed. Logo and score fonts have been updated.

Juno First is intended to be an Atari 2600 port of the arcade game of the same name. Naturally, my 2600 version required some significant simplifications, but I think the main elements are there. The visual style of the game is similar to Beamrider, but it plays quite differently. The awesome sprite graphics were created by Nathan Strum, and the the excellent title music was created by Erik Ehrling (moderntimes99).

Kabobber is just one of those games that defies definition.  Looking a bit like a cross between Q*Bert and Frogger, Kabobber is a game as strange as its name.  Along with Thwocker, Kabobber is one of the lost Activision titles that people all knew existed somewhere, but it wasn't until 2001 that a prototype was finally confirmed to exist and the rom was released.     Kabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalogs.

Since no instruction manual was ever made for Kabobber, we can only guess at what the storyline might have been.  Atari Age hosted a contest to come up with a story and manual that best fit the style of the game.  While we'll never know how close the winning entry was to the real storyline, it probably isn't too far off.  The story (such as it is) tells the tale of greedy Princess Buvsky who is attempting to devour the rainbow energy source of Kabobberland.  You must take your army of Buvskies and attempt to catch Princess Buvsky before she can reach the rainbow on the other side of the screen.  Along the way you must contend with the dangerous Kabobbers who are attempting to destroy your rescue party.

The basic gameplay of Kabobber is very simple; you must hop on the enemy before he hops on you.  To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.

As the boards progress the enemies become faster and more numerous, and Princess Buvsky moves towards the rainbow faster.  The game ends once all your troops are lost or Princess Buvsky reaches the energy rainbow.  On the later levels it's all about strategy, simply jumping non-stop towards the Princess won't cut it anymore.  You must carefully decide which enemies are worth conquering, and which are best left alone.  Don't take too long however, as the Princess has her eye on the prize.

Kabobber is an excellent action/strategy game by Rex Bradford, the man responsible for Jedi Arena and Empire Strikes Back.   So why did Kabobber never get released?  According to Rex:

"What happened was that I "finished" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it.  I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted.  Anyway, I didn't feel like working on it more, and Activision didn't want to publish it as is (and was probably a little miffed at my attitude, though they never said so), and that was that."

It's a shame Activision didn't want to release Kabobber as is, because it's a lot of fun and didn't really need anymore retooling.  Kabobber is proof that sometimes it's best to release games as is instead of reworking them to death.

Prepare yourself for a supreme test of reflexes, coordination, and agility.  You're about to face the world's most unpredictable and relentless "Mad Bomber."  He hates losing as much as you love winning. So, to keep him frowning, take a minute to read over these instructions. Then, grab your buckets and bomb away!

~From the Manual

aboom! is considered to be one of Activision's signature games, and sticks to the basic principle of being simple, addictive, and fun. At the top of the screen is the Mad Bomber, a guy decked out in classic prison garb, moving back and forth dropping bombs like crazy. You control three buckets of water near the bottom of the screen, which must catch each bomb by use of a paddle controller. If you miss a bomb, any onscreen bombs (including the one you missed) will explode, you lose a bucket, and the Mad Bomber will smile at you. One might say this was the first case of 'someone setting them up the bomb!' Earning a score of 3,000 points or more allowed you to send your score to Activision so they could enroll you in the elite Bucket Brigade.

Activision programmer Larry Kaplan originally wanted to port Dennis Koble's Atari coinop game Avalanche to the Atari 2600. But the problem was that in Avalanche all the boulders are lined up at the top which is difficult to accomplish on the 2600, hence the shift to the Mad Bomber. David Crane actually coded the overlaid sprites for the Mad Bomber himself. Although Avalanche failed in the arcades, the gameplay is quite similar to Kaboom!, and so the success of Kaboom! helps to vindicate Dennis' efforts in retrospect.

Kaboom! is a 2K game, as all the first Activision releases were. Kaplan is quoted as saying that 2K is all you really need for a 2600 title, and that 4K is extravagant. Kaplan only released one 4K title, Bridge, and he said that he only needed the extra 2K for the AI. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

    <desc>
Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.

Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.

Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used to, but actually makes the game more challenging.

While Kamikaze Saucers isn't a bad game, it's nothing special.  In the "Me Too" clone environment that caused the great crash, Kamikaze Saucers would hardly get noticed.  Syncro made the right decision in staying out of the crumbling market, especially with lackluster games like this.  Kamikaze Saucers is just one of many victims of bad timing.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES &amp; TIME

The object of the game is to score as many points as you can while helping Mother Kangaroo rescue her precious baby.  Use your joystick controller to guide Mother Kangaroo.  You star the game with three lives.

During this rescue mission, Mother Kangaroo encounters many obstacles. Push your joystick up to help her climb ladders, hop over logs, and jump over apples; pull the joystick down to help her duck under apples.  Help her pick bonus fruit, and ring the bell at the top of the screen by making her hop up to touch the fruit and bell.  Push the joystick diagonally right and left to help Mother Kangaroo take Super Leaps across broken logs.  Press the red fire button to make Mother Kangaroo throw punches at monkeys and apples.

HELPFUL HINTS: 

When a monkey moves toward you, ready to throw an apple, watch the direction of its throwing arm.  If it winds back underhand, the apple will be thrown low, so jump over it.  If it winds up overhand, the  apple will be thrown high, so duck under it.  As you progress to  higher levels, apples will be thrown mid-level, so either punch them or jump over them.

Time your ladder climbing carefully so you can be out of the firing range of falling apples.

Monkeys are usually most dangerous when you move away from them, so try to move toward them so you can punch them before they can throw apples.

Time your jumps carefully.  Mother Kangaroo can leap from the edge of a branch or log, but she must land flat on her feet.  When preparing for a Super Leap, make Mother Kangaroo walk to the end of the log with her toes hanging over the edge.  Then pull the joystick back and immediately push it up in the direction of her leap.

For a high score, climb up and down each screen until every type of fruit is picked.

Okay here is my tongue-in-cheek Odyssey 2 remake

K.C.'s Crazy Nightmare!

K.C. has found himself trapped in a Atari 2600 system along with some enslaved O2 zombies! The Atari system maze is deadly, he cannot touch the maze walls, if he does his 02 code will mix with the 2600 code and destroy him!

Story: 
K.C. has found himself trapped in a Atari 2600 system along with some enslaved O2 zombies! The Atari system maze is deadly to him, he cannot touch the maze walls, if he does his 02 code will mix with the 2600 code and destroy him! His only hope is to stay alive by keeping the O2 zombies at bay while looking for a way out!

Objective:

- Increase your score!

- Gather Bullets (white dots) to shoot the O2 zombies for 10 points! 

- Gather vitamin tablets (red dash) to slightly protect you against O2 zombies to earn 1 point! 

Game Notes:

- O2 zombies and maze walls may kill you instantly if touched (you may be able to brush by them if you have some resistance given by a vitamin tablets but don't count on it every time)! The resistance wears off and is only replinished with vitamins. It works better with O2 zombies than it does with walls. 

- O2 zombies take bullets out of your inventory when they reach a bullet before you do! 

- They take a point out of your score if they reach a vitamin pill before you do! 

- You can only carry a maximum of 6 bullets at any one time! 

- O2 zombies are sent back to the Graveyard (the center of the maze) whenever one is hit by a bullet, they will not hurt you when they are blue for a short time after they return to the Graveyard. 

- Note the excessive use or exclamation points!!! After all, this is about an Odyssey 2 character!!!  :)


Controls:

Joystick = Move
Button   = shoot (when you have bullets)

This is a simple 2 player only game where you try to score goals. Oh yeah, you also have a gun. KeepAway attempts to pay homage to the system that started it all in trying to recapture those 30 year old memories in a two player game designed for the Atari 2600 console. two players fight for the puck, the highest player wins. The top and bottom of the playfield are fumble areas. The player with the puck moves slower. Deliver the puck to your goal to score, deliver it to the other players goal to give them a point. Loose a point if the other player scores. 4 points wins the match.

Inspired by Mack Sennett's slapstick Keystone Cops series of silent films, the object of the game is for Officer Keystone Kelly (the user) to catch Harry Hooligan before he can escape from the department store.

Gameplay:

In this game, Officer Kelly and Harry are in a four story department store. Kelly starts out at the first floor entrance at the lower west right hand corner of the screen. Harry starts out at the second floor elevator door. When the user starts the game, Kelly will run to the left, toward the elevators at the center of the store. Harry will run toward the escalator to the third floor at the right hand end of the second floor. Kelly has to catch Harry within 50 seconds, and before Harry can escape off the roof of the store (Once Kelly takes the escolator to the roof, he's stuck up there for the remainder of the life).

Each game begins with Kelly having three lives in reserve. Kelly will lose a life each time the clock runs out without him catching Hooligan, if Harry escapes off the roof, or if Kelly touches one of the toy biplanes flying through the store in later levels. Kelly will win an extra life every 10,000 points; however, the maximum number of lives that can be held in reserve is three. The game is over once all of Kelly's lives are lost.

The player will use a joystick to move Kelly. Moving the joystick to the left or the right will move Kelly in the direction selected on the screen. Kelly can jump to avoid obstacles, and the user pushes the fire button to perform that action. He can also duck, which is accomplished by the user pressing down on the joystick. The obstacles include cathedral radios, which are stationary. There are also bouncing beach balls, as well as shopping carts. Touching any of the these objects will cause the user to suffer a 9 second penalty. The aforementioned biplanes, however, are deadly to the touch.

Both Harry and Kelly can make use of the escalators to take them up to the next floor. Harry will then typically run toward the next escalator, on the opposite end of the floor. Kelly can make use of the elevators at the center of the store; however, if he takes the elevator to a floor that is ahead of the one on which Harry currently is, Harry will reverse direction. When he is being pursued, the latter--unlike Kelly--can also go down an escalator to the lower floor.

Once Kelly catches Harry, the player will score points based upon the amount of time they have left. On levels 1 - 9, the user will score what's left on the clock times 100 points, on levels 10 - 15 the amount left on the clock times 200 points, and afterwards the amount left times 300 points. Kelly can also pick up bags and suitcases of money for 50 points each.

As with most early video games, there is no end to the game; each level gets progressively harder, adding more and/or faster hazards until Kelly loses all of his lives.

There is a map of the store at the bottom of the screen. This map shows where both Kelly and Harry are, which direction they are going, what floor the elevator is on, and which direction the elevator is moving.

Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.

Klax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Level 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels. Skipping levels gives bonus points and more drops.

In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by getting three or more "Klaxes" (groups) of the same colour in a line. The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (i.e., one vertical and horizontal) counts as two Klaxes. In a few early levels, the player may be able to warp ahead 45 levels if he builds a large X with five blocks for each diagonal. Doing so awards a 600,000 point bonus (plus any due warp bonus).

There are 100 levels in Klax, and a score of 250,000 is required to complete the last level.

Hello everyone,

I am announcing that I am in the process of writing my first homebrew Atari 2600 game - K.O. Cruiser.

This game has a bit of a history. Back in 1986, I started programming my first graphical game on the Commodore 64. I was inspired by the arcade version of the Punch-Out. While I was impressed by the graphics of that classic game, I didn't like the simple stick-and-move logic. The version I was working on would allow the players to move around the ring. At first I played around with the idea of a side-view of the boxers, but it didn't allow much flexibility on designing the faces. So, like Punch-Out, I went for a first-person view.

I went as far as to design a total of 15 characters. I also was able to get an early version of the game working. By this time, it was the start of 1987 - and events would discourage me from finishing the project. Later in 1987, Nintendo released "Mike Tyson's Punchout". I realized, sadly, that I couldn't make my Commodore BASIC version look better (and I didn't know how I could). As a result, I abandoned the project and concentrated on knocking out Tyson (which I never did).

Anyway, I was introduced to the idea of writing an Atari 2600 homebrew by Zach. So, why not finish the game I started 20+ years ago? Even though I have a third of the horizontal resolution than I did on Commodore 64 BASIC, I have far more control over the vertical resolution and colors. Not a bad tradeoff. In fact, my Atari 2600 version might have better graphics.

I'm attached a screenshot of the original Commodore 64 version. I've also attached a copy of the Atari 2600 version (still in progress obviously).

Please remember that my Commodore 64 version came before Mike Tyson's Punchout.

Notes:

- To punch, hold down the button and push either left or right. The button + up/down will block.

- The computer runs off a simple macro-language that I wrote for the game. It controls animation, basic timing, and conditional branching. This will allow each of the boxers to have different styles and behavior. For this early version, the computer simply walks up to the human. There is a 10% chance he will throw a punch for each cycle (flip torso, legs, bob). If he throws a punch, there is an equal chance of a left or right.

- The computer currently doesn't block. I will add this functionality later.

- The ring will not be green in the final version. I was testing the colors read from the background buffer and choose a rather visually-offensive pattern. This will change in the final version - as will the appearance of the ropes.

- The computer moves back slowly when hit. The system will update the speed later.

- I'm updating the color of the computer every two scanlines. I just haven't gotten around to creating some nice shading.


To Do:

- Sound.

- Knockdown logic. Right now both the computer and human are in "god mode with infinite ammo".

- Health bars. I will probably use a combination of the playfield and missiles.


Future:

- I don't plan to write a fancy intro screen. It will probably just be a player0+player1 bitmap.

- I hope to fit 4 or 5 boxers on the final version. However, I might be forced to bank-switch. If so, I should be able to fit far more boxers. I'm not sure how hard it is to implement.

- Since I have a basic "boxing platform", I can add characters by just updating graphics and the macro for each. As a result, I will create several sequels. One will be the "Homebrew Circuit" where everyone here can create their own boxers!

The premise of the game is that the so-called "Thirsties" want a drink, and the player must not bump into them when they begin to drink out of the pool, in order to repel them (thus preventing them from draining the contents of the pool). If the player touches a Thirstie who is not drinking from the pool, he will be bounced away. In order to complete a given stage, the player needs to quench the thirst of about 30 Thirsties. The player loses either by running out of time, or by running out of pool water. Quenching 30 Thirsties takes the player to a faster stage. The pool is technically a "life bar" for Kool-Aid Man. The party's over if the pool is drained, and that is exactly what the Thirsties want; the pool's water.

The game, designed by Dave Staugas, mostly follows the plot of the movie, and takes place on four separate screens. In the first level, the player, as Colwyn, starts at his wedding to Lyssa, which is interrupted by the extraterrestrial Slayers. The game continues to generate new Slayers for the player to fight until he is overwhelmed and Lyssa is abducted to the Black Fortress.

The player then traverses the Iron Desert on a Fire Mare, stocking up on Colwyn's magical throwing weapon, the Glaive (in the film there is only one), by pressing the button each time the horse rides over one.

The next level takes places in the lair of the Widow of the Web. The player is required to jump between moving threads of web, towards the widow at the top of the screen, while avoiding a giant spider. After completing this task, the widow reveals the location of the Black Fortress, and the player again rides a Fire Mare through the Iron Desert to reach it. If the player does not arrive at the correct time of day, according to a timer at the top of the screen, he loses a life and must return to the Widow to find out the Fortress's new location.

At the Black Fortress, the player must penetrate the barrier surrounding Lyssa with the Glaive (of which the player has a limited number), while the Beast attempts to block the player's shots and hit him with fireballs. If the Glaive hits the Beast or is not caught on the rebound by the player, that Glaive is lost. If all of the player's Glaives are lost, he must return to the Widow of the Web level, discover the new location of the Black Fortress, and traverse the Iron Desert again.

If the player manages to break through the barrier surrounding Lyssa, she turns into a fireball the player can throw at the Beast. If the fireball hits, the player wins, and the game starts over at a higher level of difficulty.

Response:

The Atari version of the game was generally well received and is today considered one of the better early film-to-game adaptations, with some of the best graphics and sound featured on the system.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE ENERGY

Kung-Fu Master is a fair port of the arcade game of the same name. You are, as the name implies, a Kung-Fu Master, and have been given the task of rescuing the fair Princess Victoria from the clutches of an evil wizard. Your only means of defense against the grippers, knife throwers, and other traps and enemies that you will encounter are your repetoire of Kung Fu maneuvers. The characters pretty much look the same with minor color differences, although a few have been given unique, albeit blocky, designs. The controls were modified to fit a one-button joystick, and as a result, a few moves were taken out. The core gameplay element remains, along with the challenge of the original, meaning that even expert game players may get a run for their money. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

Over the years Apollo has released some strange games.  From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different.  Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay.  However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet... 

Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.  Like I said, this game is weird!.

Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern. 

As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers.  These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation.  The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game.  The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number.  It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle. 

Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay.  Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke.  It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things.  Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot.  It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype. 

Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise.  Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat.  It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear.  Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.

It's dinnertime and Lady Bug is ready to eat! Take a stroll through the garden and nibble on the rows and rows of pretty flowers. Be careful though -- there are many dangerous insects that just love to eat ladybugs -- and they're fast too! Block their way by swinging the gates closed, and stay away from the deadly poison. Oh -- and don't forget to collect the bonus prizes to get the help of other ladybugs and a special invite to the Veggie Bounty Harvest! GOOD LUCK!

While many prototypes of unreleased games have surfaced over the years, there are a few notorious titles that have not. This includes Lady Bug, a title that appeared in arcades and was even advertised in Coleco's Atari 2600 Catalog, but never saw the light of day. It's not even known if work was ever begun on the Atari 2600 port. Well, Atari 2600 fans no longer have to wait for a version of Lady Bug, as Atari enthusiast John W. Champeau has developed a remarkable 2600 version! John's first Atari 2600 homebrew game was Conquest of Mars, one of the finest homebrews to be developed for the 2600.

The object of Lady Bug is to clear the maze of all the dots while avoiding up to four insects. Once all four insects have entered the maze, a bonus vegetable appears in the middle. Eating this veggie not only earns big points, but also freezes the insects for a few seconds. Also appearing in the maze are hearts that increase the bonus multiplier and letters that can be used to spell EXTRA for a bonus ladybug or SPECIAL to earn a round in the bounty harvest maze full of vegetables to eat! If the insects start to gain on the ladybug, she can use the revolving doors to block their attack as she tries to clear each maze. When all flowers and items have been collected, you advance to the next level where the insects are even faster. The game ends when the last ladybug has been eaten.

If you've ever played Lady Bug in the arcade or on the ColecoVision, you'll be amazed at how faithful the 2600 version is to the original!

Lady Bug may be purchased from the AtariAge Store, complete with a label and full-color manual designed by Nathan Strum.

In David Crane's Laser Blast you are a spaceship blasting away at enemy bases, which appear in intervals of three, while they blast right back at you. This is a game that requires speed, accuracy and a long attention span. While Laser Blast has a reputation as a repetitive and not terribly challenging game, the game select switch allows the difficulty to ramp up very quickly. Back when Laser Blast was released, if you managed to score 100,000 points or higher you could receive a Federation of Laser Blasters Patch. A score of a million points, which would turn your on-screen score into "!!!!!!", would earn you a patch adorned with those same exclamation marks. (Contributed by panda_racer)

Best described as a 3-D shooting gallery, Lasercade is an odd little game designed by Videa, the same company that created the similarly unreleased Meltdown for 20th Century Fox.  However while Meltdown had a "frenzied fun" factor going for it, there's something... lacking about Lasercade. 

The first thing you're bound to notice upon booting Lasercade is how nice the graphics look.  It's hard to believe that the 2600 can do a 3/4th perspective shooting game, but Lasercade is the proof.  The goal of the game is to shoot all the targets in the upper section of the screen before time runs out (that's original).  However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. 

In the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors.  As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful.  If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned.  However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round.  While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves.  The number of mirrors can be controlled with the left difficulty switch. 

The first round starts off with four targets for you to destroy (a light bulb, a dragon, a firecracker, and a lamp).  Each new round adds an extra target to hit, each one getting smaller and smaller. If you're successful in shooting all the targets in a given round, you will have a shot of some bonus points in the form of some fancy trick shooting.  Between each round a candelabra will appear with three flames, you must shoot one of the flames before the candles burn down.  Shooting the flame is more a matter of luck than skill, as the collision detection seems to be a bit off here.  As the rounds progress, you will be given less and less time to hit the targets.  If you manage to get through all 16 rounds you will be granted a large bonus.

While Lasercade isn't a bad game, it lacks that "something" that keeps you coming back for more.  Lasercade plays more like a fancy tech demo than a real game.  It's easy to see why 20th Century Fox opted for the graphically challenged, but infinitely more fun, Meltdown over Lasercade.  Still, Lasercade is a good choice if you want to see how nice 2600 graphics could be.

This rare, but fun side-scrolling shooter sends you into the depths of the 'Cryptic Computer' to destroy four failsafe detonators that will cause the massive computer to self-destruct, thus threatening the universe. You pilot the Dante Dart, a small but effective fighter craft that handles well in the caverns of the computer. On the way expect to battle several types of enemies and to avoid or blast your way through a number of hazards while maintaining your shields and energy to make it to the next detonator on time. 

While the graphics in Laser Gates are good, your instrument panel takes up about half of the screen, thus leaving the top half of the screen for the playfield. It takes a bit getting used to this arrangement, but after that it becomes an addicting game to play. 

As an interesting note, the detonators have '6507' on them, which is the type of CPU used in the Atari 2600. (Contributed by Shaggy the Atarian)

"In the year 1988 Earth was invaded by aliens from the distant future, who are known as kyrzons, they tried to take over in distant future,but we had the equipment to drive them off. They have came back to the past and they are waiting for the perfect time to take over. by thorough research, we have found the base in the center of the Bermuda Triangle. 

The Secretary of Defense, has called his best team to take on this challenge but they all have failed. so the sec. of Defense called on the only person who can take on this challenge, is a superhero from the distant future: Laserman."

In this game, you are Laserman in your Laser Blaser,which give you 4 lives the kyrzon's have detected you and they are armed with cloaking device and are dropping bombs on you. In order to reach the main base you have go through 5 levels,shoot down the bombs to advance to next level finish the last level you would have won,if you lose your lives the game ends and you will see what the kryzon's look like at the end screen. 

Each bomb is worth 10pts.

(no bonus points for advancing to next level (I will work on that for the cart release as well adding a special end level for getting past level 5) right now you might get an extra live getting to level to level 2(thats a bit iffy though,since I'm using pfscore1 for lives)

You are a deep sea diver in search of a fabulous treasure of diamonds that spilled from the hold of a Spanish galeon that sank during a fierce storm in the early sixteenth century.  You dive deep into the murky darkness of Dave Jones' Locker, and enter the shark-infested maze of kelp to retrieve the treasure.  You know your mission is rife with danger...the menace of the man-eating sharks that patrol the kelp beds...the lurking menace of the legendary Loch Ness monster, a beast that will pursue you relentlessly if you dare invade its territory.

~From the Manual

This game was later released as Shark Attack. The name was changed due to a lawsuit over the name's similarity to the movie "Jaws". There are some subtle differences between this and Shark Attack.

During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business: 

1. Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].
 
2. Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or 

3. Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.

    <desc>
Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name, Looping is one of the few prototypes that was known to be 'out there', but could not be located.  Thankfully Looping finally surfaced in 2003 and was released to the gaming community.  Amazingly the 2600 version of Looping plays very close to the Colecovision original with the requisite downgrade in graphics and sound of course.  However since Looping wasn't exactly a graphical masterpiece to begin with, the downgrade isn't really all that noticeable.

As the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect).  Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. 

Looping is separated into two main sections: The Airfield and The Pipe Maze.  Each level begins on the runway of the airfield where you must start the game by successfully taking off (just pull down on the stick).  Assuming you didn't crash into the building at the end of the runway, you're now airborne and can begin to complete your mission.  There are three possible missions depending on what level you are playing: Destroy the Terminal, Destroy the Missile, or Destroy the Terminal and Missile.  To destroy your target, you're going to have to shoot through the blocks that make up the structure, which as you may have guessed is easier said than done.  Since your plane is constantly moving at high speed you can only take a few shots at your target before passing it over (or flying into it if you're not too talented).  Also making your life miserable are several balloons which bounce around the screen at alarming speed.  Although you can shoot these balloons you end up crashing into them more often than not.  

If you succeed in destroying your target it will turn gray and the gate at the far end of the Airfield will open revealing the next section of the game.

The Pipe Maze (as the name suggests) is a huge maze of pipes which you must fly though in order to reach "The End".  The first room in this maze is fairly open, with several paths to take to the next room.  The main enemy in this room is a large green drop of ooze which constantly drips from one of the pipe opening.  This drop is fairly easy to avoid unless you take the top route which takes you right next to it (so try and take the bottom route).  The second room is very similar to the first, except it contains a "monster" which bounces around the top right corner.  Destroy the monster quickly and move to the final room.

The final room is one of the most difficult areas of the game.  To reach "The End" you must maneuver past three bouncing balls that are blocking the entrances to the small inner room.  Thankfully you can shoot these balls if it looks like you're about to crash, but lining up a shot can be difficult since you're still moving at a high rate of speed.  Once you make it inside you've got one last ball to deal with before you can reach the end of the level.  After touching the finish line you will begin a new and more difficult level.

It's unknown why Looping was never released since it seems to be finished and was even advertised.  One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.  Difficulty aside, Looping would have made an excellent addition to the 2600 library, and is one of the best Coleco games overall.  It appears that Coleco was finally learning after several titles of questionable quality (Donkey Kong anyone?).

This a modified version of the Dark Mage text adventure engine, incorporating the entire plot of Fellowship of the Ring into a 4K Atari 2600 ROM. Adam Thornton created this highly compressed version of the J.R.R. Tolkien classic as his entry into the 2002 Interactive Fiction IntroComp. This is twice as much story as contained in Parker Brothers' unreleased Journey to Rivendell game. The full source code is available here, and be sure to take a look at the manual Adam has written.

If there was ever a prototype I doubted the existence of it was LOTR.  After seeing the mock up screenshots in the final Parker Brothers catalog I was sure that little if any work had actually been done on this title.  Imagine my surprise when not only did the prototype turn up, but it was nearly complete!  How could one of the most sought after prototypes remain hidden for so many years?  Was it worth the wait?  Did it live up to expectations?  Would Tolkien fans have a reason to to keep on living? The answer to these questions is a resounding "sorta".

First lets make one thing clear, much like Star Wars: Episode I there was no way this prototype could have lived up to the hype.  The 20-year wait had made everybody's expectations of the game unreasonable, and poor old LOTR never had a chance.  While the game was good, it wasn't the ultimate fantasy game everyone had been hoping for.  Still, fans were happy with what they got and we're all better for having played it.  That being said, here's a complete and thorough rundown of the game.

The goal of the game is get from Hobbitton to Rivendell in as short a time as possible.  As you make your journey to Rivendell you will be pursued by the deadly Nazgul (Ring Wraith), who will attempt to kill you and take the ring.  Along the way you can meet various characters from the book, each character will help you in a special way.  Although you can simply run straight for Rivendell without exploring the rest of the game, it makes the game rather short and boring.  The game much more enjoyable if you attempt to follow the path laid out in the book.  This means stopping over in Bree, finding all the various hidden characters, and not using the ring.  While the game ending is exactly the same, your enjoyment level (and points) will increase dramatically.

You start the game in the town of Hobbitton with Sam Gamgee (the red guy).  The town scene is fairly well done with rows of houses and streets dotting the landscape.  All the towns in the game (Hobbitton, Bree, and Rivendell) look exactly the same, I guess the building codes of Middle Earth were pretty strict.  Your character is represented by a square (no room left for your graphics I guess), which you can move around the screen.  To leave Hobbitton simply move one screen any direction.  Going to the left will bring you to the road, and going either up or right will bring you to the forest. 

All in all Lord of the Rings isn't bad, and is pretty complex for a 2600 game.  LOTR main problem is that it's boring!  All you do is run away from things until you reach Rivendell, there's no way to defend yourself.  This is an unfortunate side affect of basing a video game off a fantasy novel.  Having Frodo take out his sword and slice the Nazgul in two just wouldn't fit the character (but it would make for a much more exciting game).  LOTR was never released due to two different parties owning the rights to the characters.  Tolkien's son owned one set of the rights (to the books), and some company owned the other set of rights (movies, games, and action figures).  Parker Brothers was able to get permission from one group, but not the other so the project stalled.  It's just as well I suppose; the game is average and probably wouldn't have been a great seller.  Of course with the Lord of the Rings name on it, rabid fans probably would have gobbled it up anyway.

Either way, we can finally close the book on one of the greatest prototype mysteries of all time.

You are Harrington 'Harry' Crag, commander of the starship "Endless Search".

You have landed on a MALAGAI starbase to make emergency repairs to your ship.  The repairs are now complete but the MALAGAI are holding you for ransom...they need the secrets of your advanced civilization!!! You are allowed to roam about the ship as long as you are not away from your compartment too long and you do not try to escape. Your ship is located outside a series of three airlocks.

You've landed on an alien planet and penetrated the enemy base defended by armed attack robots. Your mission is to find your way to the heart of the base and to destroy the power center of the enemy's weapon system. Robots pursue you through halls and corridors, from room to room, as their sensors detect your presence. They fire at you from all corners. It's a race against time to find the power center as you shoot back, defending yourself against the onslaught.

The concept for Marble Craze arose from those wooden games that have two knobs used to tilt a board, rolling a marble through a maze in an attempt to avoid the holes. To properly simulate one of these games, both paddle controllers are utilized, one to control the vertical movement and the other to control horizontal movement. A simultaneous two-player mode is also available. 

Marble Craze made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a tin box, manual and cart. You can now purchase a copy of Marble Craze in the AtariAge Store.

Mario the carpenter and his brother Luigi are hopping mad!  The water pipes in their house are blocked with nests of crawling creatures.  If the two brothers can't get rid of them they'll never take a bath again!

Your task is to help Mario and Luigi knock the pipe pests off floors and into a puddle of water below.  Each time a pest is knocked off, you earn points; when all the pests are knocked off, the next round begins.  You start the game with five lives, and earn additional lives every 20,000 points.

To jump from floor to floor, press the controller button while Mario or Luigi is running to the right or left.  To jump straight up, press the button when Mario or Luigi is standing still.

THE MASTER CONTRACT:

To become a MASTER BUILDER, you have to complete construction of several buildings in SPECTRAVILLE.  Try to remember the blueprints of the buildings which will appear on screen for only 5 seconds.  Don't worry about the buildings materials supply.  You can get substantial volume of bricks from stores and construct the building by laying them in the appropriate position.  A MAGIC LADDER will help you in carrying out your hob on the upper floors.  But don't forget the troublesome SPECTRADOG, naughty KID and the powerful destructive LIGHTNING. 

If the construction is succesfully accomplished, you can leave the site by catching a HELICOPTER.  However, you will lose a chance every time your finished construction is not according to the blueprint, so THINK before catching the HELICOPTER.

THE SPECTRADOG:

Don't let the cray little SPECTRADOG bite you, jump over it, or you'll lose one chance!

THE KID:

You must leave the ladder when the naughty KID comes, he used to steal the ladder and hurt you seriously.

THE LIGHTNING:

You will be killed by the LIGHTNING and lose one chance when you're on the top part of the building.

Guide HE-MAN through the dangers of ETERNIA, It's 28 long and torturous miles from the workshop of MAN-AT-ARMS' to CASTLE GRAYSKULL. The EVIL WARRIORS' are waiting for you along the way with ENERGY BOLTS and WARP TRAKKERS. If you make it to CASTLE GRAYSKULL, SKELETOR himself is ready to stop you with ROLLING WALLS and LASER BLASTS. Defeat them all BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL.

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible while guiding HE-MAN in battle against his evil foes. During the first half of the game, HE-MAN is at the controls of his trusty WIND RAIDER. He must fly the 30 miles from the workshop of MAN-AT-ARMS to CASTLE GRAYSKULL. Nearly every mile of this terrain could end the quest of HE-MAN. EVIL WARRIORS hurl deadly WARP TRAKKERS and ENERGY BOLTS at HE-MAN as he flies overhead. He defends himself with the ION CANNON, MUTRON BOMBS, and fearless flying maneuvers. With enough skill and luck, you can fly HE-MAN to CASTLE GRAYSKULL, but that's only half the battle.

Once you land the WIND RAIDER on CASTLE GRAYSKULL, you are magically projected inside a dungeon room to battle SKELETOR. The room has two moving walls. Each wall has three gaps. The walls are always in motion and the gaps are never still. HE-MAN uses the gaps to reach SKELETOR. SKELETOR Is moving and firing LASER BLASTS at HE-MAN while he tries to pass through the gaps. HE-MAN defends himself from the LASER BLAST with his POWER SWORD. If HE-MAN touches SKELETOR, the victory screen plays and you can move on to the next level.

MATH GRAN PRIX is an educational game for children, ages 6 through 10. By solving arithmetic problems shown on the screen, players move their cars along the Gran Prix track. While the game is designed to exercise and strengthen basic arithmetic skills, it also offers children an element of chance and surprise that will capture their attention and enthusiasm. 

In addition to nine different game versions, MATH GRAN PRIX contains a built-in "tutor" to encourage players of all skill levels. The computer will respond to incorrect answers by offering progressively easier problems. The problems become more difficult in response to correct answers. This helps to balance the different abilities of two players, and insures a more exciting race for each game. 

Part of arithmetic reasoning is learning to find different and quicker ways to solve problems. To enhance this goal, each player has the option of playing MATH GRAN PRIX with a time limit on each problem. A more advanced player may choose to play with a time limit, while the other player plays without. 

We suggest that you read through this manual once with your children; then put them behind the wheel. MATH GRAN PRIX will keep them playing and practicing long after they've set down their books and worksheets.

Right on the heels of Lord of the Rings comes another PB prototype thought not to exist, McDonald's!  Unfortunately unlike Lord of the Rings, McDonald's really is just an unplayable demo.  In fact the golden arches are all you'll see in this prototype.  Dave Engman never got around to finishing this game, all he did was hack a simple title screen onto Tutankham (which Dave also programmed) as a demo for marketing.  In fact 90% of the rom image is actually that of Tutankham!  

Although McDonalds is far from finished (or even started for that matter), Isabel was able to give us the details on how the game would have been played:

"You are Ronald McDonald flying in your spaceship.  Hungry aliens are descending on the Golden Arches below to eat them.  You must fly down to the ground and pick up McDonald's food to bring up and feed the aliens, but certain aliens will only eat certain McDonald's fast food (shakes, fries, hamburgers) so you need to feed them the right food.  If you don't feed them in time, they start to eat the Golden Arches, but not to worry, you can fly back down to the ground and pick up pieces to rebuild the Golden Arches."

Fans of the popular four-player Atari 2600 game Warlords (itself based on an arcade game of the same name) will be happy to learn that 2600 enthusiast Darrell Spice Jr. has created a new 2600 homebrew titled Medieval Mayhem, an updated take on Warlords. While the original version from Atari is still a blast to play, Medieval Mayhem adds arcade features such as the launch dragon, multiple fireballs and a level of polish missing from the original 2600 release. It also includes a menu to select options before starting the game. Medieval Mayhem is a frenetic multi-player game that you can enjoy against your friends (up to four people may play) or against the computer AI!

Features:

 - Launch Dragon
 - Multiple Fireballs
 - 4 AI levels
 - Options Menu
 - Stereo Sound
 - Titlescreen Music
 - Demo mode
 - Individual Player Catch Setting
 - Fireball Flareups

In October 2006, AtariAge sponsored a Medieval Mayhem Label Contest to solicit artwork for the game. The winning entry was created by David Vazquez, whose art graces both the label and manual. You can view all the contest submissions here.

Medieval Mayhem can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

Because of your reputation as a clever and daring memeber of the MEGAFORCE, you have been sent to Sardoun, a strategically important Democratic nation currently under attack.  Your mission is to destroy the Enemy Headquaters.  Armed with the world's most advanced fighting machine, the Moto-Fighter, you are dropped off just outside Sardoun.  You must pass the city and make your way across the barren desert to the Enemy Headquarters on a limited supply of fuel.  You'll be challenged the entire way by heavy air and ground attack.  Should you travel too far into the barren desert, flashing arrows will direct you back toward the enemy--that's the only help you can expect.

THE CONTROLS:

Tilt the joystick forward, backward, left and right to maneuver the Moto-Fighter around the screen.  The Moto-Fighter fires missiles at a downward angle when on the ground.  When the Moto-Fighter takes to the air, it fires straight foward.  Either way, the Moto-Fighter can fire while moving forward or backward or while stationary.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

Megamania is a frenetic shoot 'em up that pits the player against a variety of household objects (tires, dice, hamburgers, bow ties, and more) gone berzerk. These objects attack in different formations, many of which pass through the player's field of movement at the bottom of the screen. Most of these objects also drop bombs in an attempt to destroy the player's oversized cannon, making these stages even more difficult. Players can take advantage of Megamania's bonus system by allowing a cannon to be lost just before reaching 10,000 points (when an extra life is awarded), and then finishing off the remaining objects from the current wave. This allows more of the time remaining from that wave to be converted to points. Achieving 45,000 points qualifies you as an Activision Megamania. Achieving 999,999 points (or running out of cannons) ends the game. (Contributed by shadow460)

So you've decided to seek your fortune as an adventurer? Explore the mazes of Melbourne Tatty for elusive and valuable treasures. Just be careful, as this is no average maze--the walls shift and move with a life of their own to confuse and disorient you. And beware of the hungry wolf that prowls the maze, looking for a tasty morsel just like you...

Melbourne Tatty features 20 levels where your goal sounds pretty straightforward: Collect as much treasure as you can! But what fun is collecting treasure if there's no danger? This is no ordinary dungeon! Every few seconds the walls move, potentially trapping you until they move again! Now, this might not normally cause you too much consternation, except that you are not alone in this maze! A dangerous wolf is pursuing you relentlessly, guarding the treasure and trying to thwart your attempts at taking it! And while the walls will block you, they won't stop the wolf!

You do have one tool at your disposal (well, besides your wits!)--at the beginning of each maze you'll receive three decoys that you can place one at a time in the maze. After placing a decoy, the wolf will ignore you until he reaches the decoy only to discover your deception! You must collect ten treasures in each maze before moving on to the next. Can you survive all 20 levels or will you become a tasty treat for the wolf?

Not to be confused with the Atari game by the same name (which was released for the 7800), Meltdown was one of the final 20th Century Fox titles to be developed (Crash Dive was the absolute last) but was never released.  Why TCF decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market.  The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting "Just Released" had already been printed.  Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed.  Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.  

Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow!

As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment.  

The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor will be saved (for the moment).  Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily.  Once you reach the 10,000 mark, missing even one quark will likely blow the reactor.

Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to put down.  It's a shame that 20th Century Fox never released Meltdown, as it is one of their better titles.  Like many TCF games, Meltdown was not developed by Fox themselves, but rather by a small company called Videa.  Videa eventually became Sente Technologies before being acquired by Bally and becoming the well known Bally Sente.

Mental Kombat is a two player puzzle game based on a concept developed by Simon and a friend originally for the Commodore 64. The rules of Mental Kombat are as follows:

- Each player has their own color.
- You have to connect tiles of your color vertically or horizontally.
- You can move every tile of every color, this means that you could connect a row of tiles of your opponent's color if you don't move carefully enough.
- To prevent deadlock situations you can't undo the last move.
- If you complete a row of your stones your opponent will lose energy.
- If one player runs out of energy the battle is over.

AtariAge held a Mental Kombat Label Kontest in December 2001 to choose a label that adorns the cart. Initially released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, copies are now available from the AtariAge Store. Copies of the Limited Edition are available as well.

That's right.  If you want to play this game, just flip your bigscreen TV 90 degrees counter clockwise.

Do it, and nobody but your dumb self is to blame for any thing that goes wrong, such as your TV no longer functioning properly, or your TV crashing down on you and crushing the life out of your broken body.


It's totally worth it to play this badass game 2600 properly though!

Find a way out of the intricate maze before your countdown timer runs out! Use dynamite, get energy, and discover special walls in your attempts to escape from the 16 levels of Merlin's Walls!

Merlin had tolerated your disobedience before, but this time it appears he's tired of your games. It would seem that Merlin has teleported you into a strange maze with no roof, exposed to an empty, black sky! Now you must use your intelligence, something Merlin does not believe you possess, to escape this maze and redeem yourself in his eyes! Merlin has left you with a map of the first level--but can you find your way out of all 16 levels before the time expires?

This is the first game with a real-time 3D engine for the Atari 2600! You can view a video capture of the game in action here (Quicktime, 230K). Merlin's Walls displays its visuals rotated at 90 degrees, so you will need to adapt yourself or your rotate your television to fully enjoy the game! The screenshots below have been rotated to show the game in the proper orientation.

Merlin's Walls is Ebivision's third title, written by Igor Barzilai. This new release of Merlin's Walls features a professionaly printed label and manual, and all five Ebivision games sold through AtariAge feature a uniform label and manual design.

RID YOUR GARDEN OF THOSE BOTHERSOME BUGS!

An army of menacing millipedes - cousins to the famed Centipede - have invaded your garden patch, and you must shoot arrows at them to rid your plot of these pesky pests.  But wait!  The millipedes aren't the only insidious insects you have to destroy.  Jumping spiders, buzzing  bees, bouncing beetles, mosquitoes, dragonflies, inchworms, and earwigs all have unique and deadly powers of their own!

SURVIVAL TIPS

- Make sure you keep your eye on the millipede while you're getting rid of the other pests.  The millipede can sneak up on you if you're not careful, so keep it under control.

- If a millipede touches a poisonous mushroom - poinsonous mushrooms are colored differently from most - watch out!  The millipede will charge directly at you!

- When the insects swarm, you're in for big trouble if you're not alert.  Only a spider can enter the garden while the mosquitoes, bees, or dragonflies are swarming.  You get 100 extra points (above the normal point value) for the second swarming bug you destroy, 200 for the third, and so forth - up to 1000 extra points per bug.  But beware!  Swarming bugs fly fast and furious!

- Each insect has its own unique sound, so keep your ears open and you can anticipate what will be coming next.

While not as successful as its predecessor Centipede, Millipede is still a great game.  Millipede added new enemies and gameplay twists while keeping all the elements that made the original Centipede one of the most popular games of all time.  However Millipede fell into what I like to call the "Asteroids Deluxe" trap.  With all the new "upgrades" that Atari added to the game, it made it impossible for gamers to use the same strategies that allowed them to play Centipede for hours at a time.  While this was good news for arcade operators (the more often you die the more money they make), gamers complained and abandoned Millipede in droves just like they had with Asteroids Deluxe. 

Millipede can best be described as Centipede Deluxe (which was its original name).  The basic game is the same, but many improvements were made.  The first major change was the addition of DDT bombs, which are scattered around the screen. When shot these bombs form a deadly poison cloud, which will kill any enemy that touches it.  Wise use of the DDT bombs can make life much easier, especially on the higher levels.  Another significant change was the introduction of new enemies: Beetles, Mosquitoes, Earwigs, Inchworms, Bees, and Dragonflies all make their first appearance in Millipede.  

Many of these new insects are similar to their predecessors (Earwigs = Scorpions, Beetles = Fleas, Millipedes = Centipedes), but some have entirely new properties.  For instance, Inchworms which slowly move across the screen cause all enemies to slow down for a few seconds when it's shot, Mosquitoes quickly dart down the screen in a Kamikaze fashion, and Bees and Dragonflies like to randomly move around the screen making them hard to hit. 

Another new twist added to Millipede was the "Swarm" stage. Every few boards you'll be swarmed by either Mosquitoes, Dragonflies, or Bees.  During these swarms large numbers of enemies rapidly drop down the screen at random angles.  If your careful you can shoot them for big points, but its best to just try and survive (not an easy task).  Swarm stages keep the game lively and tend to make even the coolest player a bit flustered.  Millipede also features a stage select of sorts, which allows the player to start at a certain score (the higher the score, the higher the starting level).  This feature is greatly appreciated by players who mastered the lower levels and don't want to play through them again to get to the challenging levels.

Did you know that both Atari and GCC created versions of Millipede for the 2600?  Atari had always intended for its own internal developers to program Millipede, but for some reason GCC decided that they would do one anyway despite being told not to (probably in an attempt to prove they were the better programming team).  While the GCC version is considered by some people to be the better version, Atari stuck with its own people and never released the GCC version.  Rumor has it that Dave Staugas also made a harder version of Millipede for his own private use, however this version has not been found yet.

Millipede never received a fair shake in the arcades, and was frowned upon by Centipede loyalists (mostly due to the Asteroids Deluxe effect).  While it may have been a close call at the arcades, most players agree that Millipede was definitely the more superior of the two on the home consoles.  Millipede is one of the better arcade to home translations on the 2600, and well worthy of the 16K of space it takes up.

    <desc>
A game based on ESP?  Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of "Mind Reading" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...

Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the "correct" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast... 

After choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the "correct" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the "Race" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also "pass" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card. 

The current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the "Cheat" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

The cleaning woman was diligently dusting the Hall of Fame wall in the office of Headmaster Mounty Monty. Monty was quietly doing the boring paperwork that all mounties must attend to. "Excuse me Sir, but why is there a big black wreath around this one picture?" inquired the cleaning woman. Slowly removing his glasses, he looked up and studied the picture she was referring to. "That is the famous mounty "Bounty Bob" answered Monty. "Bounty Bob was considered by all to be the most loyal, heroic, and charismatic mounty that our province has ever known."

The cleaning woman was entranced. "Well, if he was so wonderful, then what is that blooming black wreath doin' up there?"

Monty reclined back in his chair as he said, "We sent ol' Bounty out one wintery day to find Yukon Yohan, a ruthless, conniving fur trapper from Sweden."

The cleaning woman gulped. Nervously, she asked "What was this evil slime of a man wanted for?"

A blank stare appeared on Mounty Monty's face. In a whisper he muttered, "Murder".

The cleaning woman was horrified. "Did Bounty Bob ever find this Yohan fellow?" she wondered.

"Apparently he did" replied the headmaster. "We found his dogsled stopped outside an abandoned uranium mine once owned by Nuclear Ned. Two sets of tracks led into the mine. We followed them into the dark passages of the mine when suddenly there was a massive explosion. A huge cave-in occurred. We were barely able to escape with our lives."

"No" answered Monty. He's still in there looking for Yukon Yohan. Old Nuclear Ned was a survivalist and stocked up on supplies so Bounty Bob won't have to worry about food ... if he survives the radiation."

Gameplay:

You control Bounty Bob in his travels throughout the mine as he attempts to capture Yukon Yohan.  You must "claim" all of the various mine stations.  Cute but deadly mutant organisms prance casually throughout the mine.  Any contact with them is fatal.  To avoid contact simply stay away from them, or hop over them if you're fast.  Scattered throughout the mine are various articles that have been lost by previous miners.  Capture them by touching them and you will be awarded points.  Additionally, the mutant will change color into a happy creature that is now edible.  Quickly run into them before they return to their deadly forms and you will eliminate them and score points.

Whenever you walk along sections of the framework in the min the sections immediately under your feet will turn solid.  To advance to the next station you must "claim" all sections of the framework.  Missing even one section will prevent you from advancing to the next station. 

At the top right of your display is the "Miner Timer".  This timer indicates how much time you have remaining to finish the station.  When it counts down below a safe level, it will warn you by flashing and beeping.  If it reaches zero, your minder dies instantly.  If you finish the station before it reaches zero you then receive the number of points that it shows.

Something terrible has happened in the mazelike Mines of Minos. The smoothly running robot operation has been interrupted by an invasion of monstrous alien life forms! Aliens stalk the corridors of the mine; only a single robot survives to battle them. Desperately he struggles to find and assemble pieces of his fellow robots scattered around the mine while avoiding the pursuing aliens. If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the alien command center at the lowest level. But if the aliens catch him he is doomed and his only weapon against them is his stock of time bombs. 

Can you avoid the monsters and assemble enough robots to expel the alien invaders from the Mines of Minos? Find out in this latest video challenge from CommaVid.

There are nine "holes" in which to hit the ball into the "cup".  Each time you hit the ball it is called a "stroke."  Although the number of strokes you take to hit the ball into the cup is unlimited, each hole has a designated "par."  Par represents the number of strokes you are ideally supposed to take to complete the hole.

Aliens from the planet of Krytol have begun an attack on the planet Zardon. The Krytolians are warriors out to destroy and seize the planet of Zardon. Zardon is the last of the peaceful planets. The Zardonians are skillful and hardworking people. Their cities are built-up and rich in resources. It is truly a planet void of crime and violence.

Zardon has built a powerful defense system. Several antiballistic missile bases have been established within the cities of Zardon. The Zardonians are ready for this attack, and are prepared to fight to save their cities.

As base commander it is your responsibility to protect and defend six cities on the planet of Zardon. The Krytolians have begun firing interplanetary ballistic missiles. They are aiming at your cities and missile bases. Your only defense is to fire back with antiballistic missiles. But watch out, the Krytolians are sly, they also have cruise missiles. Cruise missiles look like satellites, but they are just as deadly as the interplanetary ballistic missiles.

Use your antiballistic missiles (ABMs) to stop the enemy before your happy and harmonious planet is destroyed.

Here is a new bB game I call Miss It. The object is to avoid letting the moving objects hit you. How long can you last? Press the fire button to start a new game. The black and white switch pauses the game.

Many thanks to batari for making the programming language that made this game possible. Also, many thanks to SeaGtGruff for helping me get this game started. The code snippets and samples by Atarius Maximus were quite helpful. And thanks to RevEng for helping me with that missile problem.

    <name>Miss Piggy's Wedding</name>

One of the lost titles most people were sure existed somewhere, Miss Piggy's Wedding finally surfaced in 1996. Part of Atari's Muppets line up along with Pigs in Space, and Kermit's Homicidal Rampage (ok, so I made the last one up), Miss Piggy's Wedding was one of the few Atari games aimed at squarely at young girls (or very confused little boys).  Unfortunately both versions that have surfaced to date are woefully incomplete, and we can only begin to imagine what the final product would be like.  Miss Piggy's wedding was announced in several Atari catalogs, but was dropped when Atari cancelled the Children's series. 

Miss Piggy's Wedding is a maze game in which one player controls Miss Piggy and the other player controls Kermit.  The story line says that Kermit has had second thoughts about marrying Miss Piggy (gee I don't know why), and so he's decided to make a run for it.  Miss Piggy will have none of this, and has decided to track down poor Kermit and force him to marry her.  Kermit must maneuver his way through the church and make his way to the cab waiting for him at the bottom of the screen (I guess he thought about this ahead of time).

While Kermit is wandering the maze, he'll encounter wedding guests (the blocks), which will attempt to block his path.  Kermit will also find a key that randomly moves through the maze, touching the key as Kermit will cause the entrances on the top and bottom of the screen to open (allowing Kermit to make his getaway) and touching the key as Miss Piggy will cause them to close (trapping poor Kermit in the church).  Gonzo (the minister) is present at the top of the screen, but doesn't seem to do anything in this version. 

Unfortunately this is where the fun ends, because the rest of the game is unfinished.  Kermit can never escape the maze, and if Miss Piggy catches him with the church doors closed the game freezes.  Its obvious that there was still a lot of work to be done, such as the game endings (Kermit escaping or Miss Piggy catching Kermit), Gonzo's role in the game (he doesn't do anything yet), and some graphics work (the graphics are still very rough).  There are also a few glitches in this version such as Gonzo's graphics glitch when Miss Piggy or Kermit move to the right.

It's unknown whether a more complete version exists, or when work was stopped on this title.  The final game may have been mildly amusing for children, but is no great loss for regular gamers.  Still, Miss Piggy's Wedding is an interesting attempt at a two player competitive game in a time when one player games were all the rage.  Until a more complete version is found I'll withhold judgment on this title.

Mondo Pong was Piero Cavina's first programming effort on the Atari 2600 and is an evil variation on the game that started it all, Pong. In this version there are two balls and they each have a mind of their own! Sometimes the ball will double back at you after you hit it, other times it might just spin around in circles for a bit, keeping you on your toes as you wait for it to shoot off in some direction (hopefully not at you!)

There are several game variations that allow you to select one or two players and a score limit of 15 or 45. There is also a normal vs. hard option, but that is not implemented in this version of Mondo Pong.

This is an Alpha Version of Mondo Pong as it was never completed! Therefore, the game doesn't have the polish you might expect from a finished game and there may be a few bugs. Nevertheless, it's still an interesting concept and a hoot to play.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

PANAMA JOE, That's what they call him 'round these parts; though no one knows his real name or where he comes from.  But one thing's for sure,  PANAMA JOE's a daredevil from the word "go!"  No risk's too great if the reward's large enough.  Winning.  That's what's the most important to him.  And more times than not, that's exactly what he does.  Because he's tough, clever  resourceful.  And sometimes, downright pig-headed!  Though occasionally (ah-hum), he's been known to get in over his head.  Luckily, he's got a knack for getting himself out of hot water as quickly as he gets into it!  Let's hope MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE is one of those times. 

OBJECT

To help PANAMA JOE safely reach Montezuma's fantastic treasure by guiding him through a maze of death-dealing chambers within the emperor's fortress.  Along the way, PANAMA JOE must avoid an array of deadly creatures while he collects valuables and tools which can aid him in mastering the evils of the fortress and eventually, escaping with the  loot!

As a Moon Buggy driver, your objective is to travel across the surface of the moon as quickly as you can. While you progress on your journey, you'll encounter huge craters, exploding land mines, and moon rocks on the lunar surface. To make your journey even more challenging, your Moon Buggy comes under missile fire from alien UFOs, some of which create even more craters.

Push your Joystick up to jump over craters, land mines, and other obstacles. Time your jumps carefully: a poorly timed jump will cause your Moon Buggy to crash. Push your Joystick right to increase the speed of your Moon Buggy; push the Joystick left to slow it down. Press the red fire button to shoot your laser guns. When an enemy car appears from behind. use your jumping skill to jump over it, then blast it away when it's in front of you. When you encounter an enemy tank, jump over it and its bullets, or simply destroy it for maximum points.

GAME PLAY

You start the game with four Moon Buggy lives. If one is destroyed. you restart at the course segment where your Moon Buggy was destroyed. The number of Moon Buggies remaining is shown at the bottom of the screen. When all your Moon Buggy lives are lost. the game ends. To restart the game at the beginning. press the red fire button. 

There are two courses and three skill levels: Easy. Medium, and Hard (see GAME VARIATIONS). Each course is divided into 26 segments, indicated by markers along the way. A segment is completed when its x marker passes off the left side of the screen.

The gauge at the lower center of the screen indicates your location on the course. It is divided into five sections, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, and 21-26. The gauge fills with color as you travel along the course. When you complete course 1, your Moon Buggy moves on to course 2, which continues to progress in difficulty.

A timer at the bottom of the screen clocks your journey. It starts ticking away the seconds as soon as you start. When the timer reaches 999 seconds, it stops counting. but you can continue driving.

You score points for shooting UFOs and for destroying or jumping over rocks, enemy cars, craters, tanks. and land mines. You can also earn bonus points for completing the course in less than the average time (see SCORING for details).

Moonsweeper puts you in the role as a pilot of the USS Minesweeper, given the task of patrolling the various moons in the Jupiter? star quadrant, rescuing stranded miners, destroying enemy fighters, and then returning to orbit to continue patrolling. The graphics in this game are rather simple, but they are drawn very well, even for an Atari 2600 game, complete with some 3-Dimensional effects on the planets. The gameplay is very unique and somewhat reminiscent of Solaris at times, and the difficulty factor is high, making it a very unique game. Not to mention this is the only 2600 game that 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot' when you die! (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

You're second in the grueling competition of an all-day MotoRodeo. Your customized truck, a cherry little number, speeds through the dangerous obstacle course. You quickly break through a brick wall, rumble through a muddy ditch, and jump high into the air. You grin widely as you land on a Plymouth, crushing it beneath the weight of your monster truck. 

Up till now, you and your oppo nent, Trucker Tom, have been neck and neck throughout the competition, but you've just pulled ahead. Your truck paid its dues during the early part of the competition, but you're confident that you've got the skills needed to outmaneuver Tom as you race for the finish line. 

Your adrenalin pounds. You psych yourself up for the few remaining obstacles. You're only slightly ahead of Tom, but there are still a few more walls and cars to crush. Good thing you learned quickly to jump the mud which is slowing Tom down.

You rev your engine, add a burst of acceleration, and jump the last mud hole as you race for the finish line. Trucker Tom has finally met his match!

It's dinnertime, and you're simply starving.  What you would do for a nice hunk of cheese!  A slice of old-fashioned Swiss would be nice, or, even better, a morsel of Camembert.  Mmmmm.

Dreaming of cheese won't get you anywhere.  You're going to have to earn your lunch.  As a hungry but clever mouse, you'll have to chomp your way through a maze of corridors and doors, while avoiding starving cats who want nothing better than to eat you.  But those feline fanatics aren't as crafty as you are.  You can outrun them.  You can confuse them by opening and shutting trapdoors.  And, with a stash of bones in reserve, you can fool these furry menaces by turning into a cat-biting dog!

And the race is on!

You have discovered a long-sought-after buried treasure, and just when you thought your ou have discovered a long-sought-after troubles were over, things get really tough! There's a persistent shark who thinks that the treasure belongs to him, and he is after you! As if that were not enough to contend with, there's a big old octopus sitting right above your trove who keeps reaching down to check things out.

There you are, shooting at the shark, fighting off the octopus tentacles, and you realize your oxygen supply is running low. Your partner, in the boat, keeps dropping you a line, and you better run over and fill up.

It is not going to be easy to hold on to your treasure now that you've found it, but we're sure you are not going to give it up without a fight.

You're in the drivers seat and the track is just ahead of you on the television screen. Your car is permanently fixed at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the diagram. All you have to do is accelerate and steer the car through one of the four tracks (see USING THE CONTROLLERS). Each time you veer off the track and hit one of the pylons or hit an oncoming car, a simulated crash scene will appear on the screen.

No Escape! is Imagic's answer to Breakout-style games, providing a wicked twist on this popular genre. You control Jason, a hero who can throw rocks to temporarily defeat his enemies. Unfortunately, the enemies now are able to multiply when hit by Jason's rocks. Jason must use his rocks to knock out bricks from the ceiling, in a manner similar to Breakout. These, in turn, fall, and are used to wipe out Furies (Jason's enemies). 

No Escape! does allow some degree of control over Jason's enemies at the risk of getting hit by his own bricks. Furies learn how to avoid the bricks to some extent and drop rocks of their own. One hit from a rock or falling brick will cost Jason some life force. Although Jason begins with only one life, it takes several hits to deplete the life force sustaining him. Once Jason's life force is depleted, Pegasus carries Jason to his afterlife. No Escape! awards one extra hit to Jason's life force for every level completed. (Contributed by shadow460)

The year: 50 B.C. The place: a Gaulish village near the Roman outposts of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum, and Compendium. Here we find the last outpost of resistance against the legions of Julius Caesar. And who are the leaders of these indomitable fighters against the mighty Roman empire? Who has the gall to oppose Caesar's will? Why, none other than a humble menhir deliveryman named Obelix, and his small but shrewd friend, Asterix.

GAME PLAY

Your job is to help Asterix stun Roman soldiers while Obelix knocks them off with menhirs (What's a menhir? It's a... um... Oh, here it is. Menhir n.: A rough-hewn rock). Each time Asterix runs into a soldier, the soldier turns white with fear and stops in his tracks. If Obelix drops a menhir on a stunned Roman, you'll score points (in Roman numerals, of course). The faster the soldier is moving when Asterix stuns him, the more points you'll receive. If a stunned soldier is not knocked off by Obelix's menhir, he turns red with anger and becomes a dangerous foe. Asterix can only overcome angry Romans if he catches a pellet of magic potion, which the village druid, Getafix, drops from above. The potion gives Asterix superhuman speed and strength. Unfortunately, the potion wears off quickly, and as soon as it does, Asterix is vulnerable to red Romans again.

There are two types of Roman soldiers: fat legionnaires and smaller centurions. The centurions are worth twice as many points as the legionnaires (as Obelix says, "Romans are like oysters - the little ones are often the best!"). The Romans march in lanes; Asterix can only move between lanes by means of red footbridges (see figure).

There are four rounds of play: when one round is over all the soldiers temporarily disappear from the screen and a new round begins. Each round is more difficult than the last; the longer you play, the faster the action. You start the game with three lives, and score bonus lives at 10,000, 50,000 and 100,000 points.

Blazing Brickbats and Blackbirds!

Far away in the Mysterious East on the other side of the world, there lived an adventurous lad named Kung Fu Lu. Lu's grand longing was to crush the ancient, evil wall that plagued his friendly neighbors.

Guarding the wall was a mystical dragon and a cunning blackbird. The dragon would cast balls at brave Lu. If Lu successfully deflected them with his staff, he gained good fortune and special powers. If he missed a ball, it cost him one of his five lives he was granted as a child. The frightful blackbird tried to prevent Kung Fu Lu from destroying the wall, but Lu remained undaunted and continued on until he smashed the last remaining brick.

Amiga had big plans when they announced their foray into the Atari 2600.  Not only did they plan to release games, but they planned to release their own sort of Supercharger called the Power Module.  The Power Module not only would allow for larger games, but would add a 3D ability to the 2600 (with those dorky red/blue glasses of course).  Unfortunately as was the case with many companies, none of these things came to pass.  Amiga only managed to eek out one game before abandoning the crumbling 2600 market for greener pastures.  However before leaving the Atari arena Amiga had sent its second game "Off Your Rocker" off to a company to have labels applied.  Unfortunately since Amiga had pulled the plug on its 2600 division they didn't have the money to pay for labels, so the carts were kept by the label company.  Years later the company sold the cartridges off as scrap to a company called Pleasant Valley Video who slapped on a homemade label and sold them to the 2600 community. 

Off Your Rocker is a Simon Says game in which you must correctly mimic the sound and color pattern displayed on the screen.  This is accomplished by moving your little guy in the direction of the proper color pattern (which are displayed on the screen).  Since this was an Amiga game its fully compatible with the Amiga Joyboard controller and was probably intended to be played with the clunky device (notice how your guy is on a Joyboard), although the joystick will work in a pinch.  When using the Joyboard, Off Your Rocker takes on a whole new difficulty as you must move your whole body in the proper directions (it's a lot harder than you'd think, trust me).  If you fail to do the correctly your guy will fall on his butt and an ambulance will come take him away.  I guess the fall off his Joyboard was too much for him to take.

Even with the addition of the Joyboard, Simon Says is still just plain old Simon Says, hardly subject matter for a standalone game.  Perhaps Amiga was so desperate for any game they could pass off as joyboard compatible they jumped at any old idea?  I doubt they would have experienced much success had they ended up releasing this turkey; for games based on a gimmick never sell well in the long run

Take the concept of Breakout and put it in reverse while mixing in the story of the popular Three Pigs children's fable and you have Oink! You play the role of each of the Three Pigs trying to save his house from the attacking Wolf. The wolf will immediately begin breaking your house by blowing it apart one brick at a time with his powerful breath. As a pig you can grab one brick at a time from the top of the screen and drop it down to a hole that the wolf has made in the wall. If the wolf breaks through all three layers of your wall and catches you, you're dead meat (literally). (Contributed by Shaggy the Atarian)

Okie Dokie is a fast moving puzzle game that challenges you with 30 preset puzzles and 435 random puzzles. It seems simple enough, turn off all of the squares. Well, there's a catch! Every time you select a square, it gets "flipped" -- if it was on it turns off and vise versa. To complicate things further, any square directly to the left, right, above, or below the square is also "flipped". Can you complete each puzzle in the minimum number of moves?

You can get a copy of Okie Dokie in cartridge form in the AtariAge Store. Included with the cartridge is a colorfully illustrated eight page manual.

We, the leaders of the Omegan Star System, have spent countless eons perfecting our method of training our warrirs to defend our star colonies.  This method -- you may call it OMEGA RACE -- has proven so successful that evildoers tremble at the mere thought of interfering with us.  As a result, our lives have become rather mundane and boring.  So now we search the galaxies for other forms of intelligent life fast and tough enough to meet the challenge of our OMEGARACE. Having failed to locate such life, we're settling for you.  We await you in the arena!

You'll need strategy, foresight and cunning to be a success at this game.

The field is made up of a grid containing 64 squares.  Each player is designated by a color(white or black) and takes turns trying to capture as many squares as possible.  When you capture a square, it becomes your square and changes to your color.  Your corresponding score is displayed at the top of the screen.

To capture a square, you must OUTFLANK your opponent.  To do this, you must position your squares on the grid so that one or more of your opponent's squares is in a row which is bordered on each end by one of your squares.

HOW TO PLAY OUTLAW

One or two players can become expert gunslingers during these games:

In one-player games (Target Shoot), you control the movement of a gunfighter with the left Joystick Controller.  Practice target shooting with the moving target that appears on the screen.

In two-player games (Gunslinger Games), each player controls the omvement of a gunslinger with a Joystick Controller.  You score points when your gunslinger shoots your opponent's gunslinger.

NOTE: In all one and two-player games, bullets will ricochet off the upper and lower playfield boundaries.

In the Irata solar system lies the planet Stella. It is surrounded by an energy belt. In this belt there live space oysters. They make good food, so there are other outer space creatures living among them, that eat the oysters...

Starting the Game: 

Press GAME RESET or push the fire button to start. You start the game with four lives and zero bombs.

Controlling the Spaceship:

Your ship will move in whatever direction the Joystick is pushed. The red "fire" button will fire the missiles. Keep the red button pressed for continuous firing. 

Fire button has two additional uses:

- drop off a pearl in the collect zone during normal playing;

- drop off bombs during the Oystron attack. 

Gameplay: 

Enemies and Space Oysters will enter the screen on the right and attack you moving towards the left border.

Some of them will bounce and go back to the right, others will disappear.

Learn the behavior of the different kinds of enemies.

Shoot repeatedly the Space Oysters and they will eventually turn into pearls. Collect the pearls and drop them in the Pearls Zone. Your ship glows when is ready to drop a pearl.

You get a bomb putting 8 pearls in a row.

Beware of the enemies that reach the left border of the playfield, since they will try to steal your pearls. Shoot the thief enemy to rescue the pearls.

Floating pearls that reach the left border may mutate into enemies.

Stolen or lost pearls bring undesired guests in... these guys become very annoying from level 3 onwards, so get rid of them as sooner as possible! You can't kill them, but you can send them out of the playfield pushing them left with your shots.

Oystron phase: near the end of each level, you'll hear a warning signal and the screen will flash. After a few moments the Oystron will enter and your standard shots will be disabled. From this moment you can either kill him dropping the bombs and letting him step over them, or wait until he gets bored and mutates into a Space Oyster. You lose the bonus points if you let the Oystron go away. In both cases, you'll enter the Warp phase.

If you're killed in the Oystron phase, you'll be put a little back in the level, and you'll have to face the Oystron again.

Warp phase: during the warp phase, you'll travel at high speed between Space Oysters and enemies. The risk of collision will be high, but now everything is worth 100 points!

A new level will start immediately after the end of the warp phase, with more enemies and troubles waiting for you.

Scoring:

Space Oysters (each hit): 10 points

Enemies (formation destroyed): 30 points

Oystron (killed with a bomb): 1530 points + (no. of bombs left)x100 points

Extra ships: you win an extra ship every 4,000 points. From 75,000 to 99,990 points there are no extra ships. Why? Guess it! :-)

Hints: 

This seems to be a good strategy: stay on the right part of the playfield, off the pearls zone, shooting left and right. Collect pearls here and when you've enough of them, rush down and complete an entire row.

There's only a kind of enemy (except the Oystron itself) that can jump from a row to another; however, they will never jump on a row already occupied by something else. So when these enemies come out, busy rows are usually a safe place to stay.

Gimmick:

There's a way start the game near the end of the level with a load of bombs...

Oystory:

Basically, Oystron started as an exercise in Atari 2600 programming early this year, when on Stellalist (the Atari VCS programmers mailing list) we were discussing about how to reuse a sprite to put more objects on the screen. After many lines of code I realized that I almost had all the elements for a full game. This was only the beginning of the real challenge: the Atari 2600 is a classic videogame system, so this had to be a game with a true classing feeling. I've tried to recreate the fun and excitement of the great early games, so you may find elements of Sinistar, Defender and Rip Off in Oystron. But you'll have to be the judge...

Feedback:

I would really like to hear your comments, suggestions, doubts about Oystron. Send your mail to: p.cavina@mo.nettuno.it.

The Party Mix Philosophy

Humans are better video game opponents than computers.  They are more attractive and certainly more adept at conversation, but the true advantage lies in the fact that you can gloat over them when you win, and yell at them when you lose.

So get one or two sets of paddle controllers, one or three humans (not included) and mix it up.

In this case, Atari redesigned Space Invaders so that you shoot the letters "P E P S I" instead of space creatures. There were 125 copies of this game made. There is no real box for this one, just a flimsy Styrofoam shell. So it isn't really a prototype, but it wasn't a commercially available game either. And no, Coca-Cola does not have any copies left.

"I Play Baseball One Way.....All Out!"  
~Pete Rose 

Here's the first 2600 Baseball game to live up to this winning attitude.

- From the crack of the bat, make split second decisions as you choose which fielder makes the play.

- Throw popular Major League pitches - fast balls, curves, change-ups, screwballs and sinkers. (Spitballs?)

- Head to head action with your friends or against the computer.

- Complete TV-like coverage, with six camera angles you're always right there where the action is.

- Play to  a packed stadium complete with cheering crowd and organist. (Bring your own peanuts and hotdogs.)

- The most exciting baseball ever on the 2600 with depth and feel you've   seen on Big League Home Computers.

Phantom II / Pirate is a homebrew cartridge featuring two games written by David Weavil. Phantom II is based on an old Bally Midway arcade game of the same name, where your goal is to patrol the unfriendly skies and shoot down enemy bombers! In Pirate, you must explore a dangerous island and find the treasure of evil pirate Chuck DeLuc! The cartridge features a menu that lets you select which game to play upon powering up your system.

Fighter Pilots Needed!

Fight your way through day and night zones and shoot down the enemy bomber!

Use the joystick to move your fighter and the fire button to fire missiles. You only get one life, so avoid colliding with the enemy jets (you are safe at the lowest level of the screen)! In the night zone the enemy jets are only visible when the radar wave passes over them.

You start with approximately 60 seconds in the guided missile version and 90 seconds in the regular missile version. If you can reach and shoot down the bomber (which requires three hits), you'll be awarded with additional time (represented by a bar on the left of the screen). The enemy jets get more evasive and you receive less time to accomplish your goals with each successive round.

Arrrrr Matey! X Marks the Spot!

Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess!

Use the joystick to move around the island and use your fire button to fight/pick up items or use an item/enter or exit the hut. The window color represents what you are presently carrying (gray - nothing, blue - shovel, yellow - sword, green - shovel &amp; sword). The color of the display in the window shows your health. You start with three hit points (3 - green, 2 - yellow, 1 - red). Snakes have 1 hit point each. The other enemies' hit points are randomly generated. There is a flower growing on the island that will restore your health, but it only works when it is fresh. Only use it when you actually need it!

The treasure is marked by an X and you must have the shovel in your possession to dig it up. Can you find the treasure before LeDuc finds you?

Phantom II / Pirate may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

Your mission: Fly your interstellar interceptor like you never flew before... because only you stand between the Dracon armada and their cruel objective.

The situation: Serious trouble. The Human Federation has been caught napping. While pretending to sign a peace treaty, the devious Dracons have launched a surprise attack. And they've virtually captured the Federation's farm galaxy.

Victory seems so close the Dracons can practically smell it with their hideous nostrils. One lone defender stands between them and control of the human food supply. You.

About your enemy: You wouldn't want to have lunch with a Dracon.  They're not nice to look at, and they're very hostile. They live by raiding peaceful planets, stealing everything they can, and taking no prisoners. To make matters worse, they are absolutely fearless.

The Dracon armada: They're tough. Each Dracon fighter is armed with lethal photon torpedoes. You've got shields, but a direct hit can disable them. And a series of direct hits could reduce you to space dust.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

PHOENIX FIRE RISING
In ancient times, legend says, there was a bird of great beauty.  About the size of an eagle, it had brilliant scarlet and gold feathers, a melodious song, and was the only one of its kind in the entire world.

This fabulous creature lived in Arabia and had a life span of over five hundred years.  At the end of its life, the phoenix built a nest of frankincense, myrrh, and other aromatic spices.  After setting fire to the nest by rapidly beating its wings, the beautiful bird settled down to die amidst the flames.

From the ashes of that fire miraculously arose a young, revitalized Phoenix.  This new bird then took the remains of its parent to the temple of the sun at Heliopolis in Egypt, and sacrificed them on the high altar.

The long life of the Phoenix and the dramatic rebirth from its own ashes has made this legendary bird a symbol of immortality and spiritual rebirth in many cultures.  The Egyptians saw the myth as a symbol of the life cycle of the sun, which dies every day at sunset and is reborn every morning at dawn.  Most others interpret the legend as a general symbol for the regeneration of life after death.

However, something awful has happened to tarnish the long-standing image of the Phoenix.  Due to the effects of radioactive fallout on its nest, the Phoenix has unfortunately mutated into a bird of prey.

Now, several birds arise from the ashes, but these are not like the beautiful, friendly bird of old.  These birds are mean.  Their cries are shrill.  They have developed a tough, metallic-like skin that makes them almost indestructible.  And they have turned their backs on the human race to offer their services to alien beings determined to drain away earth's energy resources.

Your mission: Eliminate these seemingly immortal war hawks, destroy the alien spaceship, and safeguard our planet from ravaging energy-thieves.

You want to date the girl of your dreams.  Unfortunately, you hold this girl with too much esteem that she is high up on a pedestal and you have to get her down.  You can do this by wooing her and winning her heart with the right presents.  If you succeed, you'll score in a big way at the love-nest hotel.  But be careful!  If you mess up too many times she'll lose her patience with you and leave!

~From the Manual

Pick-Up appears to be a completed game, we can only guess that 20th Century Fox decided the game was too racy to release.

This is an adult themed game in which you attempt to take a girl to a hotel for intimate encounters. You control the male character at the bottom of the screen, and the girl is on a platform to the left. In get to her, you must shoot various objects that are falling from the sky such as a heart, a wine glass, a car, and other items that are deemed as assets to the girl.

If you accidentally shoot the same type of item twice, you loose that item and the girl's platform drops one notch. If the platform touches the ground, you loose a life. Sometimes a falling item will flash, which means you must shoot it quickly or you will be penalized. Once you have shot each type of item once, you run over and "Pick Up" the girl and take her off the screen.

Next is the hotel screen, where you and the girl enter the hotel and close the blinds. The hotel sign then displays your "score", and level starts over.

Pick-Up was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, complete with a unique label, box and instructions.

Piece Of Cake?--no way!!  

So you thought your first day on the job was going to be easy?  Well, you not only have to learn the fine art of baking cakes, but you also have to master it in a big hurry.  This is a production operation, and business is booming!  It's actually a very simple job--at first.  You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt.  Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors.  You must stack them correctly however, or--splat!!  As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep cool, and try not to earn the dubious title of "butterfingers."  Being a top notch bakery chef requires adeptness and a calm temperament, so if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!

Pitfall Harry is back for another adventure on the Atari 2600! And this time not only does he not have to worry about a time limit, but he can swim as well! Pitfall II improves on many aspects of the original Pitfall! in terms of graphics, gameplay and sound. Even in 1983 finding a 2600 game with music was a rarity, and Pitfall II features an amazing sound track that even changes according to your situation (if you pick up a piece of gold, you get an upbeat track, if you touch a bat and are sent back to a restore point, you get a depressing track). Also, instead of having a set number of lives (common with games of this era), you are sent back to the last red cross you touched if an enemy "kills" you. Yes, you will lose points on your trip back, but at least you can continue your adventure from the last red cross you touched, instead of going back to the beginning. 

The caverns that you explore are vast, and your goal is to find your niece Rhonda, the Raj diamond, and Quickclaw the cat, all the while collecting as much gold and other loot along the way. If you are looking for an excellent platformer game on the Atari 2600, you'll want to add Pitfall II to your collection. 

Activision held a contest at the time where if you were able to surpass 99,000 points in the game, you could take a picture of the screen with your score and send it in to Activision to get a cool Cliffhangers patch. (Contributed by Shaggy the Atarian)

Talk about suffering from an identity crisis, for years Planet of the Ape had been misidentified as another 20th Century Fox prototype called Alligator People.  This was because the first PotA prototype was found in case labeled Alligator People, and since no screenshots of either game existed there was no reason to doubt the name on the label.  However after much research it was discovered (by yours truly) that this game was in fact really John Marvin's lost Planet of the Apes game.  So why was Planet of the Apes found in a case labeled Alligator People?  While no one knows for sure, it's assumed that this prototype was simply put into the wrong case (they probably just used an old case they had lying around).  

You play the role Col. George Taylor (who looks a bit like Pitfall Harry's long lost brother).  Your mission is to guide Col. Taylor through a series of screens as he avoids an army of apes and makes his way towards the Forbidden Zone.  There are three different kinds of apes in this game, and they all move in a straight line across the screen from right to left.

Chimpanzees - These little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear.  Shooting them is worth 3 points.

Orangutans - Orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the Chimpanzees.  Touching them will get you captured and cost you 1 life unit.  Shooting a Chimpanzee is worth 200 points.  

Gorillas - Gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes.  Not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.  Being shot will cost you 2 life units and shooting them is worth only 42 points!

At the top of the screen you see two counters, L and E.  L is your Life counter, you start with 60 life points and if you lose them all the game ends.  The E is your Escape counter, this is the number of times you can escape from the cage or pit.  If you run out of escapes your character will be trapped forever (effectively ending the game).

The Forest

You start out in a forest with several apes after you.  You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep on coming its best to run for it.  There are also pits scattered throughout the forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly.  Thankfully you can press the fire button to get out, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  While you can run in any direction, only moving south will advance you towards your goal.  Moving south three times will bring you to the river.   

The River

Unlike other sections of this game, the river is only one screen wide.  Once again you can move any direction, but only going south will bring you towards the Forbidden Zone.  Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move through without any trouble.  As you move through the river you'll notice that your guy appears to be flailing about with his arms in the air like he's drowning.  This may be because the river was going to be deadly and a bridge put across it, but since this is an early prototype we'll assume your guy is just a poor swimmer and move on.

The Village

If you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla then you'll end up here.  You can escape from the cage by pressing the fire button, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around.  It's very easy to escape and be captured again right away.  You'll also want to escape from the cage as quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while your trapped in the cage.  Moving south three times will bring you to the desert.

The Desert

After the river you'll encounter a large featureless desert which is the beginning of the Forbidden Zone.  There are more apes here than in any other part of the game, so you'll have to be on your guard.  Each desert board looks exactly alike except for a slight change in color, so its easy to get lost.  If you haven't been caught, moving south nine times will bring you to the caverns.  If you came by way of the village (you were captured), you only need to move south six times to reach the caves.

The Caverns

These have to be the funkiest looking caverns I've ever seen.  The cavern walls are rainbow colored making your journey extra trippy.  There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but they are unfortunately a giant maze.  You'll also slowly loose life points as you traverse the caves at the rate of 1 point every 5 seconds.  There are two paths out of the caves: If you got captured at least once you to move south once, left once, and south again, but if you took the long way you need to move south once, left once, and south twice to reach your goal.  If you take the wrong path through the caves you'll end up back on the forest screen.  There are other paths out of the caves, but these work every time.

The Statue of Liberty

This is the goal you've been trying to reach.  It's a little hard to make out, but the picture is of the Statue of Liberty's torch and head.  Once you reach this the screen will begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the background scrolls through all the boards you've crossed.  After this strange scene you'll gain 10 life points, 1 extra Escape, and 1200 bonus points.  You will now start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. 

Each new difficulty level has a few changes:

The apes will do an extra point of damage when they shoot you.

The apes move faster.

More apes appear on the screen at once and come out more often.

The bonus points for reaching the Statue of Liberty increases by 100.
 
It's obvious that Planet of the Apes still has some work to be done, but was finished enough to go through initial playtesting.  Before programmer John Marvin could finish it he left 20th Century Fox to go work for Epyx.  Since 20th Century Fox closed down its video game unit three months later Planet of the Apes was never completed.

Blast your way across the planet, destroying anything and everything in your way! But don't run out of fuel, or your raid will be over!
 
What's New:

Planet Raid differs in several ways from the original game. First, it has has different audio and gameplay. The game has been made much more difficult (less fuel/battery stations, less water/space, more enemies) and the shot behaviour has been altered. Additionally, playfield graphics and colors have been changed, and sprite graphics and colors have also been tweaked.

Plaque Attack is truly a unique video game simply based on the theme of the game. You control a floating tube of toothpaste, and on the top and bottom of the screen (supposed to be the gumlines) are teeth, which are the targets of your 'enemies' if you will. Various foods, from hamburgers to ice cream cones to candy canes, will come at you from different angles. Your goal is to squirt them with a burst of toothpaste before they decay your teeth. If a food item comes into contact with a tooth, you still have a few seconds before the tooth decays (in which case it vanishes), giving you a short amount of time to shoot the food. For every 2,000 points you earn, a bonus replacement tooth will appear in your mouth at the beginning of the next wave. Naturally, if all your teeth become decayed, the game is over and it's time for a trip to the dentist! If you earned at least 35,000 points and sent a photo of your achievement to Activision, you would receive a No Plaque Pack patch. 

Interestingly enough, Plaque Attack was not the only 2600 game where your objective is to fight cavities. Tooth Protectors, released in conjunction with Johnson &amp; Johnson, was only available via mail order and is much harder to find today than Plaque Attack. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

Unbeknownst to most people, the arcade mega-hit Phoenix had a sequel.  And even though it didn't enjoy the same success as its predecessor, Pleiades remains a favorite with classic gamers today.  Unfortunately the only home port of Pleiades was for and obscure system called the Arcadia 2001, and that version wasn't even released in the U.S.!  Needless to say most people never saw Pleiades, which is a shame because its really one of the greatest sleeper hits of all times.  Had it been released, the 2600 version would have been most peoples first glimpse at this lost gem. 

Pleiades is an intense four stage space shooter, but with a few twists.  Although the 2600 may only have three of the four levels (the space vulture level is absent), the gameplay remains true to its arcade counterpart.

Stage 1:

This stage is very reminiscent of Galaga in that you must shoot down squadrons of ships as they dash around the screen.  In later levels a little space invader will attempt to form a shield above your ship, but thankfully you can shoot him to him stop (the shield can also be shot down).  Once you've destroyed all the ships you'll be taken to stage 2. 

Stage 2:

Ripped right out of Phoenix, stage 2 features a large mothership which must be destroyed.  To make your life more difficult (and the game more interesting) several large bird creatures have been dispatched to attack your ship (more birds appear each time through).  To destroy the mothership you must shoot the reactor (the plus sign) that moves above one of the three trap doors.  When the reactor appears above an open door that's your chance to zap it.  Careful aim and timing are required to score a hit, so be patient. 

Stage 3:

This is the only really unique stage in the whole game.  Here you must carefully guide your ship through a giant space parking lot (I'm not kidding) and make your way to the warp at the end.  Although it may sound easy, guiding your ship through tight spaces using only your thrusters take alot of practice.  Along the way you can collect flags for extra points, but this is only recommended for experienced players.  Once you reach the warp you'll be taken back to stage 1. 

While it may not have been the most original game out there, Pleiades is still a fun little shooter even if most of the ideas are recycled from other games.  It's a shame that Pleiades was never released, because the 2600 version actually does the original justice (a rarity for most 2600 coin-op ports).  Out of the three UA Ltd. games known to exist, Pleiades is the best of the lot.  With more games like Pleiades under their belt, UA might have had a fair chance to succeed in the highly volatile 2600 market.

With a blight of card games for the Atari 2600, enthusiast Brian Watson brings us a new card game, Poker Squares! In Poker Squares your goal is to place 25 playing cards (from a deck of 52), one at a time, in a 5x5 grid. Your goal is to make the best ten (or twelve) poker hands, five horizontally, five vertically, and optionally the two diagonals, scoring as many points as possible. Complete rules can be found at Solitaire Central (the English scoring system is used).

Poker Squares includes two options to add variety to the game. The first options allows you to disable scoring on the diagonals, making higher scores a bit more difficult. The second option will make the computer deal the first five cards to the corners and center of the grid. This makes for a much more difficult game. Author Brian Watson routinely scores 35-45 points, but there are some players who have gotten over 100 points. Can you be in the same league as them?

Poker Squares can be ordered in cartridge form in the AtariAge Store. Includes a beautiful label and manual designed by Dave Exton.

You're the commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. Your mission is to defend your country from enemy attack. 

War has been declared and you find yourself deep in enemy water with no help. In your battle, you will be required to defend against wave after wave of enemy planes and dive bombers. To make things worse, the enemy has sent their own subs and destroyers. in the course of your battles, you will need to maneuver through dangerous channels full of mines. Don't expect a short war and the battles get rougher, how many of the enemy can you destroy before they get you.

POLE POSITION consists of two races: the Qualifying Lap and the Grand Prix. In both races you're racing against time and other cars. The longer you race and the more cars you pass, the more points you score. You earn 10,000 points for completing a lap and 50 bonus points for each car you pass. A lap is one complete circuit of the race course (see diagram). 

The Qualifying Lap is 90 seconds long, but you must complete it in 73 seconds (L/73"00) or less to qualify for a position in the Grand Prix.

If you don't qualify, you can continue racing until the Race Timer counts down to zero. Then your car stops, a bonus for the number of cars passed is added to your score, and the game ends.

If you qualify, your car is positioned for the Grand Prix and a bonus for qualifying is added to the 10,000 points you scored for completing the lap. The faster your lap time, the better your position and the bigger your qualifying bonus (see SCORING). Go for POLE POSITION, the number one starting spot. It's worth 4000 bonus points.

In the Grand Prix, your object is to finish the race in the shortest possible time. At the end of the last lap, a time bonus for each second left on the Race Timer is added to your score, in addition to a bonus for the number of cars passed.

The race is four laps long. Complete each lap before the Race Timer runs out to earn "extended play" time and go on racing. If the timer runs out before you finish a lap, your car stops, your passing bonus is added to your score, and the game ends.

The history behind this prototype is rather interesting, as it may be the first promotional game ever created.  In 1978 Warner Communications, who happened to own both Atari and Ralph Lauren, assigned Carol Shaw to design a game that would tie-in with Ralph Lauren's new cologne "Polo".  It's unknown exactly how the game would be used in the promotion, but it may have been intended to be given away to customers who spent large amounts of money.  Supposedly several prototypes and handwritten instructions were sent to Bloomingdale's in New York, but nothing became of the promotion and Polo went unreleased.

Polo is an interesting game that plays like one-on-one soccer.  For those unfamiliar with the sport, Polo is played by a rider on a horse who attempts to whack the ball into the opponents goal using what looks like a long shafted croquet mallet.  The gameplay is very simple, each player simply runs into the ball with the lower half of his player (the part with the mallet) which will cause the rider to whack the ball.  Your player will only hit the ball in the direction of your opponents goal, so it's almost impossible to accidentally score on yourself with the exception of the freak reflected shot.  The playing field is very small and made smaller by the large players so games tend to be very fast and very short.  

The graphics in Polo, while on the simple side, are very interesting.  Notice how each player is actually made up of several lines instead of by a solid block.  This is because Carol used a trick called "Venetian Blinds" which allowed the 2600 to display up to eight sprites per row (instead of the normal six) by alternating them between two sets of scanlines (four on one set of scanlines, and four on the other).  One downside to this technique is that the players tend to blur when they move making it hard to pick out any detail until they stand still.  The yellow player is particularity hard to see and almost tends to be invisible when moving against the green background.

Polo features several different options that keep the gameplay interesting.  No only can you change the speed of the ball and the size of the goal, but you can affect the physics of the ball as well.  Certain games will allow the ball to travel through walls rather than reflect of them making for extremely interesting games especially when combined with other options.  Polo also offers a two-on-two mode in which players control two horses that move in tandem, but since the playfield is so small these games tend to be less fun. 

Polo is a fun little game and probably would have done well if it had been released commercially.  It's unknown why the promotion never took place, but the cost for producing the cartridges as a giveaway may have been too great.  This may very well be the first and only attempt to make Polo into a video game.  I wonder what Atari would have done if the name had been "Eau de Toilette" instead?

Pompeii was one of the last titles announced by Apollo, but went unreleased when Apollo became one of the first 2600 game companies to fold in the wake of the crash.  From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii.  For those who aren't up on your ancient History; Pompeii was an ancient Roman city at the base of the volcano Mt. Vesuvius which was destroyed when the volcano erupted in 79 AD.  Since the eruption caught the people off guard everything in the city was covered in volcanic ash, this makes the ruins a treasure trove for archaeologists because all city and its contents were protected from the elements over the centuries by the very ash that killed them.  How's that for irony?

Unfortunately the only prototype that's surfaced so far is very incomplete.  The background graphics are very well done and depict a smoldering volcano (Mt. Vesuvius) and two strange shapes on either side (treasures?).  Your character hardly looks anything like the Indiana Jones character depicted on the box, but since this is a prototype he may have been "Indyized" in later versions.  Your character does have some slight walking animation, but it's far too slow for how quickly he moves.  The brown columns on the playfield are really place holders for enemy creatures which had yet to be defined.

This prototype is little more than a movement demo.  Your character can walk around the bottom half of the screen, but if he gets to close to the top his head becomes truncated (an obvious programming glitch).  When your character walks over the column placeholders, a number (from 1 to 47) is displayed in hexadecimal notation in the lower right of the screen.  Pushing the left controller button will also make a hexadecimal number appear in the lower right corner (from 47 to 8E).  These numbers may have something to do scanline you're currently on, and were probably used to check collisions between your character and the lava or enemy creatures. 

You can make the lava level rise by pressing the right controller button.  The lava pool can extend all the way to the middle of the screen, but once you start raising the lava level there's no way to bring it back down.  As usual, the lava has no affect on your player and he can safely stand in it all day.  Beyond the excitement of walking around and watching the lava rise, there isn't anything else to do in this prototype. 

Its hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good.  After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.  Supposedly there was a finished version of the game that was ready to be ported to the Atari 800, but this rumor hasn't been verified.

Pressure Cooker is a hidden gem in the Atari 2600 library, going beyond platform or shoot 'em up games to combine speed and memorization in an addictive format. Your objective is to prepare hamburgers by grabbing and bouncing condiments around the kitchen, delivering the made-to-order burgers to their proper customers. You don't have "lives" to lose as in many games, but instead have a number of points from which deductions are made in various amounts each time you make a mistake. Points are then rewarded at the end of each level. On a side note, Pressure Cooker's manual gives a little trivia based on the origins of our common hamburgers. 45,000 points are required to qualify for the Activision Short-Order Squad and receive a patch.

Pressure Gauge is a game that was written back in 2000 as a college exercise by John K. Harvey. It's not much to look at graphically, but this game is a "twitch" game that just may have you reaching for the reset button for "just one more round". The game was inspired by a mini-game in the Playstation title "Brave Fencer Musashi".

Gameplay is simple. The initial screen says "Pressure Gauge"; from here, you can hit select to see the first homebrew attempt at a scrolling text demo (which would later be reformulated and released as StickyNotes), or you can hit the reset button to start the game. A little song will play, and you're on your way! The interface is as simple as can be-- it only uses the button. Push the button precisely when the leftmost "filling gauge" is lined up with the "range" on the left of it. Get within range, and you'll be rewarded-- slightly. The second gauge will fill up, just a little bit. You need to have a certain amount of successes in order to fill the second gauge all the way to the top, to advance to the next level. A miss results in the second gauge decreasing slightly, so you need quick skills to fill up the second gauge completely in order to advance to the next level. The rightmost bar counts down on time; run out, and it's game over!

Levels are defined as follows:

- level 1 = slow
- level 2 = medium
- level 3 = fast
- level 4 = really fast
- level 5 = really fast
- level 6 = slow, lights flicker
- level 7 = medium, lights flicker
- level 8 = fast, lights flicker
- level 9 = really fast, lights flicker
- level 10 = really fast, lights flicker
- Every 10 levels following start like level 1, but have new surprises to unlock.

Challenge the Pressure Gauge!

John K. Harvey's personal record is 54. He challenges anyone to beat that score and let him know about it. In our forums, he's known as Propane13.

This very unique title by Bob Whitehead is a challenging multi-screen adventure game. To succeed, you must learn the fastest way to negotiate the city to collect all the necessary items and return them to specific locations. You cruise around a city in a Model A auto, which can jump over obstacles. There are five different scenarios available in which the map and items are changed to make the game increasingly complex. The graphics are up to Activision's high standard, and for gamers with the patience to learn the maps, it can be a great deal of fun. Players who could beat the third scenario were able to send away for the Super Sleuth patch. (Contributed by sdamon)

Take several rows of suspended "three-dimensional" qubes. Drop onto them some very weird creatures in pursuit of a guy who loves to hop, and what have you got?

One of the whackiest games you may ever play! And a most challenging one. You may need to match two or even three rows of qubes in one round. And then there is always someone -- or some thing -- trying to stop you... not to mention undo what you've already done. It's great fun, too. When was the last time you met a Meltnik or a Shoobop? 

Q-bert's Qubes... It's a video game and another dimension.

Trivia:

Q-bert's Qubes for the 2600 was primarily sold in Sears and Hills department stores, making it very hard to find today.

Q-bert is an energetic IittIe guy, with a big nose, who hops up and down cubicle pyramids in a magical world.

When Q*bert hops on a cube, its top changes color, so Q*bert invented a little game: he loves to go from pyramid to pyramid, changing all the cube tops in each pyramid to another color.

But nothing comes easily, even in Q'bert's world. Q*bert's enemies, Sam and Coily, do their best to thwart Q*bert in his colorful game. Sometimes they make Q*bert mad enough to say, "!#?"

It takes quick thinking and a quick wrist to help Q*bert change all of the cube tops to the desired color When you succeed, YOU are the Supreme Noser!

How To Play! 

It's pretty simple in concept, but tricky in practice. Move the blocks on the large board so they match the pattern on the small board. Problem is, you can only jump to an adjacent block. The long-term aim is to achieve the highest score possible. Don't forget to complete the screen quickly to get those bonus points! 

Instructions 

Match the pattern on the small grid, by shifting the 'cubes' on the big grid.

Use the fire button to throw away anything about to hit you.  You can only use the fire button when you have score to 'spend'. The more you use it, the more score it costs.

There is a limited time to complete the pattern.  When time gets low, the border of the small grid flashes - you have about 10 seconds after that.  If you complete the screen before that, you get bonus points depending on how much time is remaining.  If the time runs out, the pattern on the small grid changes and you're back to square 1.  When the time runs out, you can no longer score points on that screen.

Jump on the fruit for bonus points, and sometimes... depending on some secret pattern ... an extra life.

Jump on the hatching eggs to kill them.

~From instructions that come with the rom

Qb was originally written for the Atari 800 by Andrew Davie back in 1984. Many years later, Andrew decided to port the game over to the 2600, and he finished his project in March 2001. The PhillyClassic Edition, limited to 50 copies sold only at the PhillyClassic 2001, was the first release of Qb. The object of Qb is to move the blocks around in the lower frame so that they match the upper frame. You can only jump between blocks when they are adjacent, otherwise you can only push them around. Fruit appears that you can jump on for points, but watch out for the monsters.

In early 2002, AtariAge sponsored a contest to create a label for the limited run Qb Special Edition. The winning label was created by David Exton, and you can view all the submitted labels (over 100!) as well as the contest details on the Qb Label Contest page.

One of the four Atari Club games available exclusively via mail order from Atari, this title may have been available later in stores in very limited quantities. This is one of the most rare games from Atari, as only approximately 10,000 were initially made. According to programmer Steve Woita, the game was play-tested by a group of young girls. Not surprisingly, they did not like the game and found it too difficult, so Atari decided not to heavily distribute the game. That's unfortunate, because it's an original and good game. It was also the first Atari game to feature voice synthesis. Quadrun! Quadrun! Quadrun! Today, Quadrun is very sought after by collectors.

Quadrun and Open Sesame are the only two Atari 2600 games to feature speech synthesis.

Sunrise programmed and released this adventure game, and both critics and the public received it favorably. Telegames later acquired the rights to it and still sells the game today. The Sunrise version is obviously much harder to find, especially the box and manual. The manual is a simple typed sheet of instructions.

Quick Step! is a unique take on the Q*Bert formula by adding two player action and a more frantic pace. You are a kangaroo who loves to paint trampolines green. However, a squirrel likes to paint them blue. Naturally, this can result in some hectic competition between the two. Jumping on one of the trampolines will turn it the color of your character and earn you points. During the game the trampolines scroll down to the bottom of the screen before they disappear. Naturally, you must avoid being on a trampoline when it disappears, otherwise you will lose a life. 

Occasionally, you may find a special square that will cause your character to flash. If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

The Object: You are a rabbit trying to get through the Mysterious Meadow and the Land of Ledges to start a family and make it grow.

The Situation: Meadow meanies are trying to prevent you from getting to your friend, the turtle, who will carry you down the river to the Land of Ledges. Sneaky snakes, bothersome butterflies, chattering choppers and other meanies will send you back to the top of the Meadow or take away one of your chances.

If you avoid all these obstacles and leap atop the turtle, you will go to the Land of Ledges.

Here, you will hop from ledge to ledge, attempting to turn them all into one magic color. But beware of a heartless man who will interfere by dropping rocks and undoing all your hopping efforts.

If you do succeed in changing all the ledges into the magic color, you will go to the Bunny Bushes and start your family.

You are a racquetball player, and you have accepted the challenge of a formidable opponent. Both combatants enter the arena through the opening in the wall, and the frenzied game begins with the crack of the racquet against the first ball. The pace is fast and furious as the ball recoils from the backboard at ninety miles per hour. Are you fast enough to react in time to return the ball? Can you endure the fast pace and vanquish the opponent? If you are willing to try, it will leave you as breathless as a real game on a real court. WARNING: Don't let your opponent ace you...

ENEMY JET AT 12 O' CLOCK!

You're locked in fight-to-the-death air combat with the enemy!  You may be outnumbered -- somehow you've been separated from your buddies -- but this is far from your first mission.  You've been flying your trusty little delta-wing fighter for more months than you care to remember. 

Suddenly you sight an enemy interceptor at 12 o'clock! These babies are a piece of cake.  You sneak up from behind and zap it with a few rounds from your machine gun.

Just when you're feeling a little cocky from your last successful hit, an enemy Bomber appears out of nowhere. This one's not so easy.  Not only is its tail gunner an expert shot, but the Bomber is surrounded by a fleet of Escorters, and you can't even get at it with your guided missiles.

It's going to take all of your expertise, along with your arsenal of ammunition, proximity missiles, and guided missiles, just to stay alive.  Any minute you could be sabotaged by a cagey patroller or the unsuspecting victim of a sneaky Stealth Fighter.

Prepare for the dog fight of your life.  It's going to be a killer!

Raft Rider is a single player, full color game designed to be played on the Atari Video Computer System or the Sears Video Arcade. White water everywhere! And hidden in the strong current are any number of dangers lying in wait to capsize your log raft. Your mission is to make your way downstream as far as possible, avoiding treacherous rocks, feisty moose, and sections of tree which have been cut down by a pesky beaver. Skillful maneuvering is not without rewards, however, because there are also gold nuggets appearing in the river, which, when touched, can be accumulated to extend your trek into the wilderness. So, put on your coonskin cap, get on your raft, and ride that white water to glorious high scores! Go ahead, get your feet wet; just try to keep the rest of you dry!

WELCOME TO EGYPT, DR. JONES!

Dust off your felt hat, throw on your leather jacket, and uncoil your rawhide whip - you're going on the greatest treasure hunt of your life! Put away the glasses and three-piece suit of respected archeologist "Professor Jones," and say hello to swashbuckling adventurer Indiana Jones* - Indy to your friends. Your mission: Find the fabled Lost Ark of the Covenant.

The Lost Ark. A dazzling treasure covered by a sheet of shinig gold, the Ark was used by the ancient Hebrews to carry stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. According to the Bible, the Ark possesses extraordinary powers and is able to "level mountains" and "lay waste to entire regions." Any army possessing it, the Bible says, is invincible.

You've been hired by the government to find the Ark before your country's enemies do. The only question is, where?

As an expert on the Egyptian occult, you know the Ark was hidden inside a chamber called the Well of Souls in the year 980 B.C. The location of the chambe is a mystery - but there is a way to find it. Go to the secret Map Room in the city of Tanis, and, if you're holding the right object at the right time, the location of the Well of Souls will be revealed. Of course, finding the Map Room is no easy task since Tanis was buried long ago in a sand storm that lasted over a year. You'll need sharp wits and courage to overcome the obstacles you encounter on your way to the Ark. Armed with your wit and steel nerves, however, you can handle anything! Anything, that is, except snakes - they've always given you the creeps. Snakes or no snakes, though, you've got to find the Ark! 

You're getting closer to the Ark, now. Look out! What's that slithering out of the corner? It's a deadly asp! Snakes! Why did there have to be snakes...?!

It's the year 3006, and the evil "Rainbow Invaders" from the planet "Pacco", are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980's arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

Rainbow Invaders is a new Space Invaders style game for the Atari 2600 from Italian developer Silvio Mogno. While many games of this nature have been released for the 2600 (to say nothing of the countless Space Invaders hacks), Silvio's game adds a breath of fresh air to the genre. Yes, you are shooting at descending waves of alien invaders, attempting to finish them off before they reach the ground. However, the aliens also periodically drop one of 16 random Special Shots, some of which will help and some of which will hinder your efforts if you catch them. Your ship also features a shield that will make you invulnerable for a few seconds, at the expense of not being able to fire again right away.

AtariAge held a Rainbow Invaders Label Contest to design original label artwork for Rainbow Invaders. Nearly 50 entries were received, and one entry from Nathan Strum was chosen as the winner and now graces the Rainbow Invaders label and manual. You can view all the entries hereng annihilated? And once you reach the bottom, can you make it out alive?

Rainbow Invaders may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

Rampage is a port of the Midway arcade game with the same title. This version was programmed by Bob Polaro, who programmed several other 2600 games, such as Road Runner and Defender. The premise of Rampage is simple: You have been turned into a gigantic mutant creature, either a giant ape, a giant lizard, or a giant wolf, and are now bent on wreaking havoc across the entire United States. You must destroy buildings and eat anyone that stands in your way. Naturally, the army will be trying to stop you using their guns, bombs, and whatever else they have at their disposal. The menu screens are actually very well done on the 2600 in terms of graphics, and the portraits of the monsters are well rendered given the 2600's capabilities. Unfortunately, the actual in-game graphics are very crude at best. The buildings all look the same, and there isn't much detail to the monsters or the humans. 

It's a good effort at porting the arcade game to the Atari 2600, even if the graphics suffered a bit in the translation. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

Raster Fahndung is a puzzle game where you must locate patterns of 6 by 6 squares inside a playfield of 32 by 20 squares. Sounds simple enough in theory, but with the timer ticking down in the background you don't have the luxury of carefully scrutinizing the playfield to locate the patterns! And when you sneak a peek at the pattern (by pressing the fire button on your joystick) the timer counts down even more quickly!

The game starts with the creation of a random playfield consisting of 32 by 20 squares. Your cursor is located in the middle of the board. Push and hold the fire button to display the 6 by 6 pattern you must match on the playfield. You can use the joystick to move your cursor in all directions. Your cursor points to the top left corner of the 6 by 6 search pattern. Press the fire button when you believe you have found the correct position. If you are right, you'll receive points. If you are wrong, the required pattern is displayed again.

In a simultaneous two player game, both players must locate the same pattern, but each player can view the required pattern individually. The player who finds the correct position first receives one point. The two player game ends when the countdown timer reaches 0 or when one player manages to reach 9 points.

The left difficulty switch allows you to choose the game timing mode. "Easy / A" selects the fixed time limit per level, starting at 90 and decreasing by 5 per level until the minimum of 20 seconds is reached. All following levels offer 20 seconds. The timer on the "Hard / B" setting starts at 90 seconds and you have to find as many patterns as possible within this period.

How many patterns can you find before the timer expires?

Join the Atari Aces in the World Series of video baseball--RealSports BASEBALL!  It's a hot day in the ballpark--you can see the hot dog and soda pop vendors making their way up and down the bleachers.  The crowd roars after each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of "STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!"  Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each other in an enormous diamond of brown and green. 

The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up.  His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  "STEERIKE!"  Another windup, another 90 mile an hour fastball, and "STEERIKE TWO!"  Gripping the bat tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME RUN!

Realsports Basketball is the only title in the Realsports series that was announced and never released.  This is strange because basketball is a fairly popular game, and you'd think it would be one of the first titles to come out.  There could be any number of reasons for this, but the main theory is that the game simply wasn't coming together well and Atari decided to stop development on it.  

RS Basketball's main problem is the flawed gameplay.  The game is played two-on-two, with each player moving his men in tandem.  This means that the bottom man can only move around the lower half of the court and the top man can only move around the top half of the court, so making tricky moves and dodging your opponent is nearly impossible.  Forget dribbling, you'll spend most of your time passing the ball back and forth.  If you attempt to run the ball you'll simply end up running into one of the computer controlled players and having the ball stolen.  This leads us to problem two...

Ball stealing in RS Basketball is seriously flawed.  Simply touching your opponent will result in having the ball stolen!  This coupled with the limited range of movement for your players makes for very frustrating games.  Fouls are occasionally called (controlled by the left difficulty switch), but they are limited to reach-in fouls and tend to get annoying quickly.  Apparently there graphics for a referee in the game code, but the ref does not actually appear in the game.  Speaking of graphics, this leads us to problem three...

The graphics in RS Basketball are a notch above the original Basketball cart, but that's not saying much.  For 1983 these graphics are absolutely abysmal!  The players are rendered as little guys with blocks for heads with absolutely no detail, the baskets are a tiny net on a oversized pole, and the background consists of a single set of empty bleachers.  I guess the fans didn't want to stick around and watch this sham of a basketball game either.  The sounds in the game are minimal, only consisting of cheers for making a basket and a rather pathetic dribbling sound.  Speaking of dribbling, how does a square ball bounce?

It's hard to see how this is an improvement over the Atari's classic Basketball game.  Sure the graphics may be better (slightly), but the gameplay is much worse!  There are no time outs, no shot clock, no foul line shots, no 3-point shots, no out of bounds. How exactly is this basketball again?  Obviously Atari had some more work to do on this title, but it's doubtful that completing it would have improved the game much.  Sports games were never the 2600's strong suit, and with the Intellivision and it's superior sports lineup nipping at Atari's heals, RS Basketball wouldn't have helped Atari's cause.  Atari did manage to redeem itself with the superior basketball game Double Dunk in the late 80's.

You're the quarterback of the ATARI offensive team, and you're really feeling the pressure.  Down by less than a touchdown in the closing seconds of the game, you have to maneuver that ball into the end zone somehow for the winning score.  How will you do it?

You could run with the ball and try to evade that wide-ranging middle linebacker.  Be careful, though.  He's a littel bit faster than you and will catch you over the distance. 

Fortunately, you've done your homework by practicing your passing in the one-player game against the computer.  But this is head-to-head competition against a real person, and people aren't always as predictable. 

It's your ball.  Hurry!  Time's running out.  Can you call the right play and get that touchdown?

It's the final game of the season, and once again the championship is at stake--only this time, it's among old rivals.  A goal by the opposing team ties the game with one minute to go.  You wipe the sweat off your forehead as the score flashes across the screen of a giant indoor stadium: Blue Defenders 2, Red Rebels 2.

With precious seconds ticking away, the crowd is growing restless in the stands.  The team lines up for the final kick-off.  You hear the SCREECH of the referee's whistle and the ball shoots towards your center position with the velocity of a bullet.  You dart forward and kick the ball to a wing player, but a Rebel skillfully steals it away, leaving you off balance. Crashing to the side, you hear the ball whizzing past your left ear. 

Don't worry!  A player on your team intercepts the ball and kicks it to a teammate.  But in the tension of the moment, he misses.  You close in from the wing.  Too late!  A Rebel gets control of the ball and dribbles it towards your goal.  Like a shadow, you follow close behind.  Only you can steal the ball and prevent him from scoring a winning point.  In a split second, your foot snaps the ball from beneath his feet and brilliantly kicks the ball high across the field.  What a pass!  The crowd rises to their feet, and cheers, anticipating a possible victory.

With 20 seconds to go, you sprint towards the center of the action.  A star player for the Rebels tries deflecting the ball to the sideline, but under pressure from your team, the ball spins towards you.

You rush to meet the ball before your opponents close in.  With a tremendous low kick, the ball barely leaves the ground as it shoots into the goal.  A Rebel makes a quick dive and...misses.

The crowd erupts into a frenzy.  Your team has won the game--and the championship!  Proud fans jump up and down in the stands.  In the resounding roar, you hear the loud clear chant of VICTORY.

It's a gorgeous day at the beach. You and your friends have been playing a friendly little game of vollellball. At least it started out friendly. The higher the sun gets, the hotter the game.

Your team has slowly been slipping in points. It's time to get serious. The team that loses buys lunch.

It's your turn to serve. You gauge your opponents carefully. The sun is on your side, and you spot a weak point in the other team's formatlon. You raise your fist quickly and connect. The ball speeds directly to the opening for the winning point.

You're the hero. The other team's members come over to shake your hand. They may be smiling, but you hear a low grumble as they approach. After all, thanks to you, lunch is on them!

I took a break from my Dick Tracy hack and started fooling around with this one. It's a sad attempt to make Atari's vector game Red Baron for the VCS. The source is Spitfire Ace.

I'm only a graphic hacker so colors are out of my league. I have replaced the houses and guns with pillboxes and tanks. Also vectorized the score digits, and tinkered a bit with enemy plane props (for some reason I don't see the wings in the code anywhere). Also discovered where the road was and attempted to "vectorize" it as well.

I based this off of screen shots from klov and after playing the original on MAME for a few minutes.

Feel free to alter further. I'd love to go with an all black background and white sprites. It would also be cool to get the blimp in there, but as stated that's way beyond what I can do...

Maybe one could consider this the flight equivalent of what Atari did to Battlezone on the 2600.

Combat a bit too simple? Try it again, but this time with more intricate mazes. Plus, this game features an early version of the Combat AI coding so you don't have to play alone. There are two versions of this hack, the original and a special Pac-man version which features the maze from the arcade version of Pac-man. Based on the Combat AI source code.
 
What's New:

Playfield has been changed to produce more detailed maze screens. Player sprites have been reduced in size.

This is one of the most interesting prototypes in my collection.  Simply labeled Football, this is the famous Red vs. Blue demo that Tod Frye did for Rob Zdybel to show how many sprites the 2600 could push at once.  Rob later went on to create RealSports Football, possibly using parts of the kernel from this demo.  Tod mentions Red vs. Blue in "Stella at 20".

The demo itself is remarkable because it shows 22 objects moving at once (11 players on each side).  This is more moving objects than I've ever seen on the 2600, obviously Tod knew his stuff (so lay off the Pac-Man jokes already!).  Red vs. Blue acts funny on the various emulators, most likely due to the hardware tricks it uses to produce the 22 moving objects.  Z26 for example shows two extra players in the upper left and all the players are slightly out of place.  Other emulators place the characters in slightly different places.

Reindeer Rescue is the "unlimited" release of the 2005 Holiday Cart. Reindeer Rescue is an original homebrew game written by Bob Montgomery, author of the captivating homebrew game Go Fish! In Reindeer Rescue you must help Santa rescue his lost reindeer in a journey that has you starting at the North Pole, racing through frozen tundra, ice caves, suburbia, and the big city! But Santa is not the athlete he used to be (1943 state champion in 400m)--he has grown a little...girthy...around the middle. His doesn't have quite the energy he used to, and if it drops too low he'll fail in his task! Along the way Santa will encounter many objects in the air and on the ground--some will help and some will hinder, so be careful!

Reindeer Rescue features in-game artwork by Nathan Strum (who has contributed to several recent homebrew projects), and included a beautifully illustrated label and manual by Dave Exton, whose brush graces many homebrew games.

Reindeer Rescue can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Star Wars: Ewok Adventure was one of the games everyone was sure existed somewhere, but didn't turn up until 1997 when a collector had a friend whose father worked at Parker Brothers give him one of the most sought after 2600 games in existence.  Unfortunately the rom was never distributed for various reasons ranging from fear of lawsuits from Lucasfilm to the possibility of selling it on Ebay.  While this prototype was never seen again (most likely sold to a collector in a private deal), a PAL version was discovered in 2001 and finally dumped for the gaming community to enjoy.  Recently another NTSC prototype was discovered in a thrift shop near Boston, and will hopefully be dumped soon.

The gameplay can best be described as a combination of Sky Jinks and Frontline (if you can picture that I'm impressed).  You control an Ewok glider and must attempt to destroy the shield generator bunker hidden on the forest moon of Endor.  This can be done in one of two ways, either you can land your hang glider on the bunker doorstep after picking up some explosives from your buddy in the woods, or you can take control of an AT-ST Walker or Speeder Bike to do the job.  Of course the Imperials aren't just going to hand over a Walker or Speeder Bike because you asked nicely, your going to have to take it from them "Ewok Commando" style.

Your first task is to control the glider and not to crash into the various forest obstacles (trees, rivers, and boulders), not to mention the Imperial forces (speeders, walkers, and stormtroopers).  The glider can be controlled by pushing left or right to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, and by pressing up and down to either dive or climb.  Diving downwards puts you directly into dangers path but lets you gain speed, climbing upwards will take you high above the danger but you'll begin to loose speed.  The controls take a bit of getting used to, but become almost second nature after awhile. Scattered throughout the forest are large swirls, which will instantly boost your altitude without a reduction in speed if you fly over them.  Think of them as giant forest fans.

Your Ewok buddy isn't defenseless; he's carrying several large bags of rocks to rain down destruction upon the enemy (maybe that's why he has trouble getting off the ground?).  To sling rocks at your enemies simply press the fire button, but be careful as you only have a limited supply (indicated at the bottom of the screen).  If you run out of rocks you can reload by flying low over a boulder screen.  You can also avoid enemies all together by flying over them, but the taller the enemy the harder it is to fly over them.

Of course if you go about destroying all the vehicles you see you'll never be able to infiltrate the bunker, you need to take control of an enemy vehicle.  To confiscate an enemy vehicle you must carefully fly over it while exactly matching its altitude (you can use the shadows on the ground to help determine you altitude).  This is rather tricky, but if you succeed you'll have your very own Imperial vehicle to smash the bunker with.  Unfortunately you'll soon notice that Ewoks can't drive worth shit, and the vehicle will basically be out of control.  You can loosely affect which way the vehicle is going with the joystick, but it's mostly a matter of luck.  If you're skillful enough you can take the vehicle to the bunker for the final showdown.  The arrow at the bottom of the screen will show you which way the bunker lies and will disappear when you're directly beneath it.

The bunker screen is really easy, simply drive your vehicle up to or land your hang glider the doorway.  You'll see a lone Ewok run out of the bunker and it will blow up.  After this you'll be taken to level two which has more obstacles to avoid and now the enemy fires at you!  Also take note that from level two onward you must pick up explosives from your Ewok buddy in the woods to blow up the bunker with the hang glider (destroying it with a vehicle doesn't required the extra firepower).  From level three onward your glider will initially be hard to control until you fly over a fellow Ewok in the forest (I guess he fixes your glider).  You can tell if your glider has been "fixed" because the screen boarder will change from blue to red.  If you're bored you can find programmer Larry Gelberg's initials hidden in the game by flying all the way to the bottom mountain range from any "green" screen.

You'll see the initials LG beneath the mountains, but they'll look like TG since the PAL version doesn't scroll far enough down to reveal the bottom part of the L.  If you complete the sixth level, at the start of every new level you'll see the words "Tribe Member" indicating that you have way too much time on your hands.

Ewok Adventure is a fun yet challenging game.  Unlike most other PB games which were based off arcade games, Ewok Adventure didn't have to live up to an already existing game so there is not feeling of being "let down" when the conversion didn't go well.  About the only complaint I can make is the lack of in-game music.  Programmer Larry Gelberg explains the lack of music this way:

"With Ewok Adventure, I always wish that we had enough room for music, but that was a fairly graphics intensive game, so we didn't have enough memory (even with our whopping 8K!) for tunes.

So why was Ewok Adventure never released?  One word: Controls.  According to Larry:

I had this artistic vision of the purity of the hang-glider controls - forward dives and speeds you up, back climbs and slows you down, and catching thermals every now and then maintained your altitude.  The marketing weasels either didn't get it or just didn't like it.  They tried time and time again to get me to put in a mode where you just go in the direction where you point the joystick.  But I was young and arrogant and refused, and they ultimately killed the game.  Sorry, everyone."

So because some marketing weasels couldn't figure out how to control the glider the game was ultimately cancelled.  How's that for management at work?  It's a pity that Ewok Adventure never got released, because it's simply awesome, and the best Star Wars game overall for the 2600.  Well at least we can finally play Ewok Adventure after a 20-year absence, and it was well worth the wait.

Hieroglyphics on an ancient obelisk tell a strange tale:
 
These are dark times.  Death's long shadow rests across the Valley of the Kings.  Anubis, jackal-headed god of the dead, has cast his curse over all of Pharaoh's kingdom.  A plague of scorpions and hordes of thieves lie thick upon the  land.  O hear the thin whine of despair! 

Sing  of  Pharaoh's Son, all hail the Prince of Egypt!  Deliver  us  from this  curse!  Brave the dangers of the desert.  Seek the answer to the  Riddle of  the Sphinx.  Pay Anubis' ransom with your treasures, O cunning  Prince  of Wiles.   Reach the Temple of Ra, source of light and life.

Pharaoh's heir--be wise, be wily--and beware!

~From the Manual

Riddle of the Sphinx is an adventure game created by Imagic, and truly one of their most complex games for the Atari 2600. You are the son of a Pharaoh, who must traverse the desert of Egypt in search of great treasures which must be offered at various temples in order to appease the ancient gods and lift a curse off of Egypt. The trek is not easy, however, as the prince must deal with thieves, fatigue, and thirst. In addition, the player must keep an eye on their status by using the right difficulty switch and the TV-type switch to change the status views. The right joystick is used to select items, while the left moves the prince and throws rocks at enemies. Attacking thieves with rocks results in bonus points, while actions like attacking a trader or a god will result in points being lost. The prince can also be attacked by scorpions and thieves, in addition to sustaining damage for angering a god. Time heals wounds, and oases will cure the prince's thirst.

Riddle of the Sphinx is a fairly complex game, meaning that one should read the manual before playing. Once you figure out what you need to do, it's a very unique and fun game. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

Operation River Raid

Alone in your F-14 assault jet, you're about to understake the most explosive mission of your celebrated flying career.

After taking off from a sea-based carrier, you'll tear through the skies above the ocean and streak toward a river delta, where you must destroy an enemy bridge. Once past the delta, you must navigate back to the carrier and safely land. Without stopping for handshakes all around, you'll then set off on a new, more dangerous mission.

This is no contest for amateurs. Once airborne, you'll have to refuel in midair while outmaneuvering enemy fire. If you manage to outfuel these fearless devils by blasting them with missiles or torpedoes, you'll also win points.

If you don't make it, two backup planes will come to your rescue. Your missions will continue until your squadron's name is history.

~From the Manual

David Lubar's River Raid II, the sequel to the Carol Shaw hit, is much more technical than the original. This time around you have to take off and land your F-14 assault jet, use radar and even refuel in mid air. Your jet's altitude factors into this game, as you use missiles to attack helicopters and jets and your torpedoes on enemy sea vessels, tanks, water towers, landing strips, buildings, and bridges. Unlike the original game, no patch was available for River Raid II. (Contributed by panda_racer)

Your mission is to score as many points possible by destroying enemy tankers, helicopters, fuel depots, jets and bridges before your jet crashes or runs out of fuel.

~From the Manual

River Raid is the grandfather of all vertical shooter games and is a great classic for the Atari 2600. You control a fighter plane going down the River of No Return and it is your goal to destroy enemy tankers, helicopters and jet, racking up as many points as possible. Avoid touching the sides of the river as that will crash your plane and watch your fuel as well, as an empty tank means will put a quick end to your flight. Fortunately there are many fuel tanks along the river, but they will become scarcer the farther along you fly. There are two types of river terrain you will encounter, light green and dark green. When the river is going through light green terrain it will go straight through without any land obstacles in the middle. Dark green terrain forces you to choose a side as the river will split in two and you cannot fly over the land. Periodically you will encounter bridges that must be destroyed in order for you to continue on your mission. 

One very impressive aspect of River Raid is that the dark green terrain is quite varied, which breaks any monotony the game could hold. The graphics are well designed and the playfield scrolls fluidly during the gameplay. The sounds consist of your planes engines, the shots you fire and explosions. And finally, the control is dead on. You can speed up or slow down your plane by pushing up or down on the joystick. By reaching a score of 15,000 or more you could join the River Raiders and receive a River Raiders patch. The maximum score that can be reached in the game is 1 million points.

Robot Tank TC (Tank Control) is a version of Activision's Robot Tank (as suggested by Scott Stilphen and modified by Thomas Jentzsch) that uses two joysticks to simulate real tank controls. To play this version on a real 2600, you should use joysticks with a fire button on the grip and perhaps attach them to something. If you want to enjoy Robot Tank TC using the Cuttle Cart, you need to use the correct bankswitching mode ("FE - Activision 8K"). To play with z26, you should pass in the parameters "-g5 -j2".
 
What's New:

Control Coding has been modified to allow the use of dual joystick in controlling the tank.

Greetings.  As you well know, sophisticated enemy Robot Tanks are quickly advancing cross country, firing at will and stopping at nothing.  You must command your own Robot Tanks to stop their charge of chaos.  Avoid being hit by enemy fire, or your Robot Tanks may be destroyed.  The rebels are currently headed towards downtown Santa Clara.  Only you can stop them.

Good luck!

~From the Manual

Robot Tank is Activision's attempt at the Atari arcade game Battlezone. This game, like many of Activision's titles, is quite fast-paced, and features gameplay that requires quick reflexes as you dodge enemy fire while trying to squeeze off the perfect shot at enemy tanks. An indirect hit will damage your tank, possibly causing your tank to become slow and cumbersome, or even disrupt your sight or radar capabilities. Like another Activision title, Enduro, Robot Tank requires you to play during different environmental conditions. Score high enough, and you could add another Activision patch to your collection. In this case Activision rewarded three different "Tank Corps" patches, each one reflecting a minimum number of enemy kills. The patches awarded were: Medal of Merit (48 enemy tanks), Cross of Excellence (60 enemy tanks), and the Star of Honor (72 enemy tanks). (Contributed by Lord Helmet)

While Boris uses "Upsidasium" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping."  Now I know the show didn't exactly make sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when they came up with this plot?

Twisted plot aside, Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they float up to Natasha.  R&amp;B sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects.  Treasures can be snagged by flying Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent muscles he can only hold two valuables at once.  While you can give any treasure to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on the screen, these are the two that actually count.  If you give these two treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to 75, giving you more time to look for the next combination.  However there's another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do.  When this timer runs out, the game ends.  This timer can be extended by selecting different game variations. 

While you're zipping around the screen Natasha will occasionally drop something out of her plane which looks like a row of brown dots (bullets?) which will cause you to fly out of control for a few seconds if they hit out.  Other than Natasha there's really nothing in this game that can harm you, but since this was a kiddie game it wasn't exactly supposed to be violent.  Bullwinkle will occasionally drop a brown box of some sort which allows Rocky to carry six treasures instead of 2.  The left difficulty switch affects how many treasures you need to give to Bullwinkle (one or two), while the select button changes Rocky's control scheme.  Normally Rocky simply moves left, right, up, and down with the joystick as you would expect, but by pressing the select button you can put him in loop mode (indicated by the arrows at the bottom of the screen).

While Rocky is in loop mode pressing up or right will cause him to do a right loop (the long you hold it down the further he goes into the loop), and pressing left or down will cause Rocky to do a left loop.  While this control scheme may sound difficult, it becomes second nature after a few minutes.

As if the game wasn't strange enough, you can change the shapes into numbers and mathematical symbols by putting the TV Type switch to B&amp;W.  This makes the game a bit more challenging because now the player must add or subtract the numbers they catch to equal the number Bullwinkle is displaying (ack! edutainment!).  In this mode the left difficulty switch controls the difficulty of the numbers (1 or 2 digits).  As with the treasure variation, you can give other numbers to Bullwinkle for points, but they don't count towards the solution.  This variation also lacks the 'storage box' that is present in the treasure variation. 

The amazing thing about this prototype isn't the gameplay, it's the graphics.  It's simply amazing how many items are moving on the screen at one time with absolutely no flicker.  The train circles the bottom of the screen puffing smoke, Bullwinkle circles around the sky in his plane, Natasha moves back and forth in the helicopter (shooting at Rocky), and tons of valuables constantly move up the screen.   All of this action actually makes it the screen a bit busy, which has to be a first for any 2600 game.

The 2600 version of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle was actually designed before the Intellivision version, instead of the other way around as was usually the case.  Even though Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle was complete and passed quality assurance, it was canceled for unknown reasons.  The Intellivision version was still on schedule to be released, but Mattel closed their doors before it could be completed.  The rom file for this game exists, but has never been publicly distributed due to copyright reasons.

    <name>Rubik's Cube 3D</name>

    <desc>
As 2002 was quietly winding down, an announcement was made that took the collecting community off guard.  Long time collector David Winter announced that he had discovered a previously unknown prototype, which appeared to simulate a 3-D Rubik's Cube.  Unfortunately since the prototype had no labels we can't be sure what the actual name is, but all available evidence suggests that it was simply called Rubik's Cube.  So to keep from confusing it with the Rubik's Cube cart Atari did release, we'll call this one 3-D Rubik's Cube. 

3-D Rubik's Cube appears to have been in development around the same time as Atari Video Cube as both have a 1982 copyright.  Why Atari would go with the bland "one-side-at-a-time" version when they had this amazing 3-D version is unknown, but there may have been copyright or licensing issues that forced Atari to change the look and feel of the game.  This argument is further supported by the fact that Atari renamed the game "Atari Video Cube" instead of keeping the name Rubik's Cube which is used in this prototype.  However the biggest mystery surrounds the re-release of Atari Video Cube as Rubik's Cube in 1984.  Obviously Atari finally secured the rights to the name, so why not release the 3-D version instead of simply recycling AVC?  Until the programmer for either game can be found, the world may never know.

As you probably already guessed, 3-D Rubik's Cube is a computer simulation of the old Rubik's Cube puzzle that was all the rage back in the mid 80's.  Unlike Atari Video Cube, 3-D Rubik's Cube is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of the cube faces at once rather than one.  This makes solving the cube much easier as the player doesn't have to have a super human memory to remember the other five sides.  Since 3-D Rubik's Cube is shown in a proper 3-D perspective, players can manipulate the cube just like they would in the real world.  This is a far cry from Atari Video Cube's gameplay which involved an elf running over squares, picking up and dropping off colors (what the hell were they thinking?). 

3-D Rubik's Cube as two different play modes: Normal and Cheat (toggled by the left difficulty switch).  In normal mode the player can rotate the cube in any one of four directions until the desired side appears.  Once a side has been selected, the player can then rotate the individual slices (rows and columns) until they think they have it in the right position.  The player repeats this process until the cube is solved (or they go insane).  In cheat mode, the player can actually set the colors on the cube to what ever they desire.  Players can even create impossible to solve cubes by placing too much of one color or not enough of another.  Due to the strange nature of this "cheat mode", people have begun to speculate it may have been put in for debugging purposes.  It is unknown if it would have been included in the final release. 

As if this prototype wasn't amazing enough, 3-D Rubik's Cube even includes a solve mode.  If the player gets too frustrated they can choose to have the computer solve the cube for them (Yes the 2600 IS smarter than you!).  However players cannot activate the solve mode if the colors have been altered in cheat mode, so you'll have to put them back into their original configuration first.  This was done to prevent players from building unsolvable cubes with the cheat mode (there's always one kid who has to ruin it for everybody).  Unfortunately there is no way to automatically restore the colors, so it's up to the player to remember what they changed. The solve mode is actually a step-by-step demonstration (controlled by the fire button), and shows the player each move it is making.  This way players can learn what they did wrong and become better Rubik's Cube solvers (good luck beating those guys who solve them in 10 seconds flat).

The graphics in 3-D Rubik's Cube are simply amazing. While they may have some rough jagged edges, each square on the cube is displayed at the proper angle to give a true 3-D perspective.  It is theorized that the cube is made up of a combination of playfield and character graphics, which allows multiple colored squares to be shown on the same scanline.  The sound effects are pretty standard for a puzzle game, consisting of a beep when rotating the cube, a little victory song upon solving the cube, and a nasty crashing sound when the solve mode fails (due to misuse of the cheat mode).  It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into this game

The only problem with 3-D Rubik's Cube is that the game is just as tedious as the real world puzzle.  Why would players waste their time screwing around with a simulated puzzle (especially with the awkward controls) when they could just pick up the real thing?  Rubik's Cube 3-D is proof that just because you can digitize something doesn't necessarily mean you should..

Ever been stuck in a traffic jam?  Haven't you always wished you could just floor it and zip in and out of traffic, blowing up all the cars that were in your way?  While you may not be able to do it in real life (not without a lengthy jail sentence anyway), here's one game that will let you live out your fantasy on the 2600.  Rush Hour is one of the long lost Commavid games that everyone assumed existed somewhere.  Not only was Rush Hour advertised in catalogs, but prototype boxes had already been produced hinting that the game was almost finished. Sadly Rush Hour, along with Underworld and Mission Omega, never made it to store shelves before Commavid folded. 

Rush Hour is a driving/action game similar to Spy Hunter, but turned on its side.  Your goal is to zip in and out of traffic on a five lane highway, and destroy the five car carriers that are causing the traffic jam.  Your car comes equipped with two laser headlights (they come standard with the deluxe package), which you can use to shoot any cars that get in your way.  However once a car is destroyed it will turn into a deadly pile of debris which cannot be destroyed.  You can avoid the debris by changing lanes, but since this is rush hour finding an open space can be difficult.  Alternatively you can also burn cars to a crisp with your red-hot exhaust (I'm sure the environmentalists just love your car), this is useful for those pesky cars that like to sneak up behind you.  Also on the road you'll also see what appear to be oil slicks, but in this prototype the code to handle them is not present.

As you zip in and out of traffic you'll undoubtedly get hit at least once.  Thankfully your car is alot tougher than it looks and won't be instantly destroyed.  However depending on the severity of the crash, your car will take some damage which will affect how it functions.  The damage will be repaired over time, but you can also repair this damage by stopping on the top of the bottom of the road.  However in the time it takes to repair your car, you may risk letting the carriers get away (as shown on the radar at the bottom of the screen).  Interestingly there's a bug in the code that causes your car to get repaired past the normal limit (this was due to the programmer confusing hexadecimal with decimal notation). 

Once you've reached the carriers you must carefully watch and shoot each one as it unloads its car.  Before a carrier unloads a car it will turn orange and flash briefly, it's during this time you must shoot.  As you're shooting the carriers be careful to avoid the cars that are unloaded as crashing into one will almost certainly result in your untimely demise.  Also take note that you only have one life in Rush Hour, lose it and it's game over.

Although Rush Hour is playable, the prototype still has a bunch of bugs that needed to fixed before it was released.  The most serious of these bugs is in the display routine, which will cause the screen to jump unexpectedly from time to time (especially when you reach the carriers).  Other bugs include slight graphic and sound glitches, nonfunctional oil slicks, and inaccuracies in the radar.  It seems the game was in the process of being debugged when the programmer was involved in a serious car accident (how's that for irony?).  Due to this accident, Rush Hour was delayed and never completely finished. 

Commavid was always known for their interesting games, and Rush Hour is no exception.  Rush Hour was one of the first games Commavid not programmed in-house; instead it was contracted out to an independent programmer.  It appears that Commavid was finally starting to make some headway towards becoming a larger player on the 2600 scene; unfortunately the market crash put an end to those dreams.

Saboteur is a brilliant multi-level shooter by Howard Scott Warshaw, the man responsible for such famous 2600 games as Yars Revenge, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T..  The game revolves around a robot name Hotot who has discovered a alien missile base hidden on his planet.  These evil blue aliens are using Hotot's planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source.  With the help of the mysterious Gorfons, the native yellow birdlike race, Hotot must destroy the rocket, disarm the warhead, and prevent his planets destruction.  

Saboteur is a highly original game, and would have been a sure fire hit for Atari.  According to Howard, Saboteur was compete and just about to be released when Atari decided they wanted to change it into the A-Team.  Why Atari thought Saboteur would make a good game for their A-Team license is anyone's guess, but it was due to this that Saboteur got shelved indefinitely.  Sadly the A-Team never was released either, so players were ultimately denied the chance to play one of the best games on the 2600.

Save Mary! was one of those 2600 revival titles that should have been released but was ultimately lost when Atari closed its Atari 2600 operations in 1990.  Save Mary! may have been in development longer than any other Atari 2600 game (over two years according to some sources).  One reason for this was Atari management constantly making changes to an already complex game, but another reason for the long development cycle was that programmer Tod Frye (of Pac-Man fame) may only have been working part time for Atari at the time and was also working on another unreleased 2600 game Shooting Arcade.  No matter what the reasons were it's a shame Save Mary! never got released, as it's a fun and highly original game. 

The game title says it all, the goal of the game is to "Save Mary!".  Apparently Mary is a rather stupid girl who has somehow got herself stuck in a canyon that's rapidly filling with water (don't you hate it when that happens?)  Using only a crane and several odd shaped blocks you must build a platform for Mary to climb onto and make it high enough so you can hoist her out with the crane.  However your task is made more difficult due to the shape of the blocks (otherwise it wouldn't be much of a game would it?).  Not all the blocks come in nice little squares, each level has its own unique set of blocks which require clever planning to successfully link them together into a platform for Mary. 

Further complicating things is that Mary appears to have started panicking and will run back and forth around the platform.  Remember that Mary is human (despite the gaping hole in her head!), and like most humans she doesn't take kindly to being squished with blocks (or having them swung into her).  Take special care when dropping blocks not to hit Mary or it's game over.  Also be sure to watch out for the low flying airplane that appears on the higher levels (yes I said Airplane).  If the plane hits your crane you will automatically drop the block you're carrying (possibly squishing Mary).

Save Mary! tends to get tough fast if you don't learn how to make the most of the power-ups, and can quickly get out of control if you don't have a plan for how to stack the blocks.  Strategy and planning are the keys to winning Save Mary!, but taking too long will result in one waterlogged corpse.  Overall Save Mary! is a Tetris variant with enough variety to keep gamers coming back for more.  Atari had a winner on its hands, as Save Mary! was a game that could have made Atari owners say Wow!  Unfortunately the age of the 2600 was over and brilliant efforts like this ultimately came too late to save the dying system.  On an interesting side note Nolan Bushnell himself is quoted as saying that Save Mary! was one of his favorite upcoming Atari 2600 releases.  One would think that with this kind of endorsement Save Mary! would have seen the light of day.

    <desc>
After much rumor and speculation about its existence, a prototype for this game was finally found in early 2002.  Save the Whales had long been rumored to have been playable on the short-lived Gameline network, although nobody could actually remember playing the game.  Was it worth the wait?  Did it live up to expectations?  Not really.

Save the Whales was actually supposed to be part of a trio of eco-friendly games designed by Steve Beck to raise money for various charities and organizations.  The other two games in the series "Dutch Elm Defender" and "Attack of the Baby Seals" were never programmed.  Proceeds from Save the Whales would have gone to Green Peace, but since the game was never released they got didilly squat (take that you hippie freaks!)

You control a submarine that must "Save the Whales" by shooting the harpoons or nets thrown by the ship at the top of the screen.  You can choose between harpoons or nets by changing the difficulty switch, harpoons are smaller and faster than the nets so they're harder to hit.  If a harpoon or net hits your sub you'll have some damage, if you take five hits it's game over and all the whales die! 

The game is very fast and very hard, so lasting for more than a few minutes is a real achievement.  The choice of colors in Save the Whales is questionable, as the ocean is green and the whales are various shades of purple, orange, and red.  The sounds are nothing to speak of, and consist of a few appropriate beeps and explosion sounds.  All of these things come together to form a rather mediocre game, but given that it was set to be released by 20th Century Fox it probably would have fit right in.

The world wasn't missing much by not being able to play this lost game.  It's fun for a few minutes, but the repetitive nature of the game and flawed gameplay doesn't endear itself to anybody.  I suppose for a charity related game it's alright, but one has to wonder if it wasn't rushed just a little bit.  Somehow I can't see Green Peace condoning videogame related violence, but I guess when it comes to saving the cute little whales all bets are off.  My only question is why doesn't the submarine just shoot the damn whaling ship?  That would solve a lot of problems.

Proceeds from this game were to have gone to GreenPeace

This game was finished at MNetwork in the 1980's, but never released. In 2000, Intellivision Productions released this game complete with a simple box and manual. It is still available from their web site. Sea Battle is the Atari 2600 version of the Intellivision game of the same name. At one point it was called High Seas, which was consistent with MNetwork's policy of changing the name of a game when it appeared on a different system.

A steady hand and quick wits are crucial if you are going to win this action packed air-sea battle!  You must constantly dodge enemy fire and possible collisions with enemy helicopters and ships.

As the game begins, you have eight Sea Hawk fighter planes in your defense arsenal but can only use one at a time.  Your weapons include a machine gun and an unlimited supply of torpedoes.  The black AtakLaunch ships and E-Gull helicopters are the enemy and you must eliminate them. If your plane is hit by enemy fire, your pilot will parachute to safety, but he needs your help to reach one of your Red Hawk aircraft carriers.  If he lands in the ocean or on an enemy ship, he's dead.  For now only one enemy helicopter will appear on screen at a time. 

You graduate to Level 2 when you score 10,000 points.  The battle grows more furious as two enemy E-Gull helicopters appear on screen to do battle with you.

The intensity increases when you score 30,000 points and enter Level 3. Here you will be attacked by three E-Gull helicopters that boldly challenge you, determined to down your planes!

You are diving for treasure in perilous waters infested with man-eating fish and vicious sea monsters!  You must be careful to choose just the right moment to dive into the water because you cannot defend yourself while you are diving.

As the game begins, you have four divers but can only control one at a time.  Each diver receives 60 seconds' worth of oxygen for every dive he makes.  Your only defense against the dangerous man-eating fish is a harpoon gunuse it well, for those fish are devious!  You must harpoon all of the fish in the water and enter the sunken Spanish galleon before another fish appears. 

Once inside the galleon, you will be confronted by three vicious sea monsters who jealously guard the galleons's three treasure chests.  Your harpoon gun cannot help you now because the sea monsters are invincible.  You must swim quickly to avoid them!  Keep your wits about you as you dodge these clever monsters because they can trick you by passing right through the walls of the ship!  But you can escape them by entering one of the ship's many narrow passageways! 

To retrieve the treasure chests filled with gold doubloons and valuable pieces of eight, you must reach the treasure and touch it.  But watch your oxygen level!  When the level is low, youmust return to your boat for more oxygen or drown.  And the way back to your boat is just as dangerous as the journey down because more man-eating fish await you in the waters between your boat and the sunken treasure ship!

You are the captain of the ships sailing on the seas.  Confronted with the attack of sea monsters, you must strikeback by firing torpedoes or deep-sea bombs.  These sea monsters are active in three different waters.  And your hit will score differently.

You can move your ship to left or right on the seas to avoid the attacks of sea monsters.  These sea monsters are numerous, while you have only six ships.  Therefore, you must defend yourself very carefully.  Otherwise, your ships will be sunk by the tricky sea monsters.  

When your scores hit 1,000 points, you will be supplied with one more ship to boost your fighting ability.

This is an excellent shoot-em-up from Steve Cartwright, who programmed numerous Activision classics such as Frostbite and Megamania. In Seaquest, you control a yellow submarine who must destroy numerous waves of sharks and enemy subs, all while trying to rescue friendly divers. Seaquest features excellent graphics for a 2600 game, and it's also noteworthy for having very satisfying sound effects. Like many of the best 2600 games, it starts slowly and ramps up to become quite frantic in later waves. Earning a score of 50,000 points or more and sending proof to Activision would net you entrance to the prestigious Sub Club organization. (Contributed by sdamon)

Atari 2600 programmer Manuel Rotschkar (Gunfight, Star Fire) has completed his latest Atari 2600 title, Seawolf, which is his 4K entry in the 2004 MiniGame Competition. This game is influenced and inspired by the Midway Sea Wolf and Sea Wolf II arcade games as well as the Astrocade and 8-bit home versions, but is not a direct port. Seawolf also borrows elements from Broderbund's Seafox.

In Seawolf you command a submarine lurking below the surface of the ocean, where you need to attack enemy convoys while avoiding depth charges and other dangers. But use your resources wisely, as you don't want to be a sitting duck when you run out of torpedoes, or worse, fuel! And watch out for the Red Cross ships, as they have a surprise for you if you accidently target them!

Seawolf features four difficulty settings, with a matching color-coded score display so you can tell which difficulty setting you are playing at quick glance. Seawolf is the first Atari 2600 homebrew to feature 24 pixel wide multicolor sprites.

Seawolf can be purchased from the AtariAge Store, where it comes in a translucent blue cartridge to match the game's water theme, and keyed to the original label created by Dave Exton. Dave also created a stunning, full-color eight page manual to accompany the game.

With a name like Secret Agent, I was expecting a Cloak &amp; Dagger type game with lots of shooting and fast paced action.  What I got instead was a Kaboom clone with a twist.  Not exactly what I was hoping for, but not a bad game either.

You play the part of. Umm. a little guy with a board across his head? (a secret agent I suppose) as he attempts to catch the falling "spy booty" from above.  These items consist of money, suitcases, and little capsules with US on them (I have no idea!).  Now your thinking that this is just a simple Kaboom rip off right?  Well that's where you're only sorta right.  In Secret Agent you must also avoid the bad items that will get your agent captured such as grenades, guns, and bugs (real bugs!).  This is fairly easy at first, but once the action picks up it's more a matter of luck than skill.

After collecting enough items a tone will sound, this is the signal that you must "make the drop off".  Below your agent is a lake with some boats moving about, you must line your agent up with the boat and press the button to "hand off" the evidence.  If you successfully hit the boat you score bonus points, if you miss there doesn't seem to be a penalty.  At the top of the screen there is a guy with a gun chasing after another guy.  These guys don't seem to do anything and appear to be eye candy. 

Considering it's from Data Age (the people who brought us Sssnake and Bugs!), Secret Agent is a pretty decent game.  However even with the slight twist Secret Agent can't escape the fact that it's just a Kaboom rip off (which in turn was a rip off of Atari's Avalanche), although it is a good one.  Secret Agent was the last Data Age game to be completed, but the crash forced them out of business before it could be released.  It's doubtful that an average game like this could have saved a dying company, but at least it shows Data Age was starting to get its act together.

SAVE THE HUMAN RACE!

First there was one alien space station, then there were three. Now there are eight. If left unchecked, laser gates, dragons, and other evil creatures will wipe out the human race.

To destroy each station, you'll have to confront the aliens in face-to-face combat and discover the secret destruct code. Once you have the code, use it to activate the station's self-destruction mechanism. Then the race begins. Can you get to the teleport room before the station explodes into the vacuum of space?

Are you ready? Remember, you'll need precision battle skills, a keen sense of direction, speed, and pure guts to save the human race.

LOCATE AND ABSORB ENERGY!

You're a scientist, and your invention, a pulsating, glowing orb called the Sentinel, absorbs and stores energy from a variety of sources. Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens, and you must use your creation to save your planet.

You must defend the Sentinel against alien attacks as it glides over four enemy planets, absorbing all alien energy sources in its path.

The Sentinel absorbs the energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your light gun. When an energy source is hit, the Sentinel absorbs the target's energy.

Each of the four alien planets is more difficult to conquer than the last. You must find and destroy the alien lords who guard each planet's power station. Destroy the station to destroy the planet. Then move on to the next world.

A single alien entity controls the other alien lords. When you have destroyed the four worlds, the Sentinel will come face to face with this evil entity. Defeat the final evil to complete your quest!

~From the Manual

Only two games take advantage of the light gun controller on the 2600: Sentinel and the unreleased Shooting Arcade.

Shoot your way through the Alien shifting shields to give yourself a clean shot at the attacking Alien Queens!

Shield Shifter 2009 by John A. Reder - This game is a spiritual Successor to Strip-Off and answers the question where did all of those lost Shield parts go after the aliens took them away. :)

How to begin from title screens:

- To start Single player Mode = press fire on Player 1 Joystick.

- To start Two player Mode = press fire on Player 2 Joystick.

Player 1 Objective:

- The game ends when you loose all three of your fighter ships.

- You score 500 points for each alien Queen destroyed.

- You score 1 point for each first level shield block destroyed.

- You score 5 points for each second level shield block destroyed.

- You score 10 points for each third level shield block destroyed.

- The Alien Queen shoots lasers and drops sticky bombs. Sticky Bombs will block your ships path for a few moments.

Player 2 Objective (Two player mode):

- Kill player 1's ship 3 times to end the game.

- Prevent player 1 from obtaining a high score.

This rare Imagic game is quite similar to the arcade game Carnival. Both games represent an old fashioned shooting gallery in which conserving bullets and careful selection of targets is key to getting a high score. It was programmed by one of Imagic's veterans, Dennis Koble, who also wrote Atlantis, Trick Shot, and Solar Storm. This game should not be confused with the Atari Corp. prototype Shooting Arcade, which uses the XE Light Gun. (Contributed by sdamon)

Sinistar on the 2600?!?!  Yes you're reading this right; Sinistar on the Atari 2600. Somehow Atari managed to cram the complex arcade game Sinistar into an 8K 2600 cartridge, and the results were simply amazing!  After many arcade ports of questionable quality, Atari finally managed to get one right. Too bad they never released it...

For those of you who've never played Sinistar... Shame On You!  Sinistar is one of the most beloved (and difficult) arcade games of all time, combining fast action, mind numbing speed, and evil sounding voice synthesis into one explosive package.  The main object of the game is to destroy Sinistar, a giant metal creature bent on destroying the universe and whatever else that gets in its way.  Of course to destroy Sinistar you're going to need some firepower, and in Sinistar firepower comes in the form of Sinibombs.

To manufacture Sinibombs, your ship needs to harvest Sinisite crystals out of the planetoids.  To harvest the Sinisite simply move in close to a planetoid and start shooting away.  After a few shots tiny Sinisite crystals will appear which you must quickly grab before they float away.  Worker ships fly around the screen and harvest their own crystals to help build Sinistar, taking away valuable resources.  In the arcade Workers would also steal your crystals, but for some reason they seem to have turned over a new leaf and give the crime a rest in this version (be thankful!).  As you attempt to mine crystals, Warrior ships will zip around the screen attempting to blow your ship to kingdom come. 

If you can successfully manage to hold off the Warrior ships long enough to harvest some crystals, your ship will eventually fill up with Sinibombs.  It's about this time Sinistar will usually start chasing your ship. If your lucky enough (and destroyed a large number of Workers), you can find Sinistar half built and defenseless, otherwise he'll be on the move and after you.  As Sinistar is chasing you, you must press the fire button to release the Sinibombs.  Sinibombs are the only thing that can harm Sinistar, so don't even bother trying to shoot him with your lasers.  Each Sinibomb will blast off a segment of Sinistar until he is completely destroyed (which takes 18 direct hits).  If you only manage to blow off a few segments the Workers will start repairing him, and he'll continue to chase you.  If you manage to totally destroy Sinistar you will be transported to the next sector where the action resumes at a harder difficulty level. 

It's simply amazing how Atari managed to capture the action and excitement of Sinistar and condense it into the tiny 2600.  The graphics are excellent (by 2600 standards), and the controls are sharp and precise.  The only places Atari had to compromise on were the voice (which was impossible to reproduce on the 2600), and the controls which had to be simplified slightly due to the 2600 only having one fire button.  In the Arcade there were separate fire buttons for shooting and dropping Sinibombs, but on the 2600 your ship has auto fire, so the fire button drops the Sinibombs instead.  This really doesn't take away from the gameplay since you were always shooting in the arcade anyway (your fingers just got a bit of an extra work out). 

So why wasn't Sinistar released?  Around the time Sinistar was being completed (early 1984), the video game market was crumbling fast and many new games never got released.  Atari had already commissioned artwork for Sinistar, and the game seems to have been nearly completed so it was probably a matter of weeks before Sinistar would be finalized and ready for production.  Perhaps playtesters thought the game was too difficult or wasn't polished enough, but whatever the reason Sinistar got shelved and was forgotten about.  An Atari 400/800 version was also in the works and nearly complete.

As you start your journey, winged creatures wil try to kill you, but with your charmed lance and carefull flying by PEGASUS, you can overcome their challenge. You collect points for each creature destroyed and when all are gone you reach the castle and face the dragon. The wily dragon will not fight you directly, for he has seen how you devastated the creatures outside, and beathes its fire at you from behind a magic screen. The fire will not kill you, but will temporarily stun PEGASUS so he cannot flap his wings. Kill the dragon with your lance and you will save the maiden. Once the dragon is killed, you will face new creatures guarding another castle, and these defenders will have heard of your exploits and be more difficult and so will the dragon.

You have to get to school on time, but passing up the chance to ride ramps or cruise tubes would make you look like a real nerd!  You've got to conquer a total of thirty tubes and ramps in under five minutes to be totally awesome.  Not only that, after you find all the tubes and ramps you have to find the front steps of the school building.

"You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike" certainly describes the situation you are in.  

You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the maze.  To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps is a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly.  Acting quickly, you blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton vanishes in a flash of colour.  But as you reload your UD, you hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the hunted in this nightmare?

Skeleton+ is a 3D maze game written by Eric Ball. In order to escape this labyrinth you need to hunt down and eliminate 80 skeletons lurking about without being killed yourself! There are eight mazes, with each maze containing 10 skeletons. Complete all eight mazes and you'll gain your freedom!

Skeleton+ contains several improvements over the original release of Skeleton. The major differences are:

 - Life and Kill Counters
 - New Undead Locator to help track Skeletons
 - Five vs Ten Skeletons per level (selectable)
 - Various difficulty settings

The new difficulty settings allow you to customize the game to your liking, and maximize replay value! You can now set to start with five or ten Skeletons per level, start with 49 life and half damage, toggle the Undead Locator on or off during gameplay, and choose to have the Skeleton speed reset only at the start of a level. In addition, you can use the B/W switch to toggle "touch of death" for Skeletons.

If your Atari 2600 has been modified for stereo output, Skeleton+ takes advantage of this to help you locate Skeletons in the maze!

You can get a copy of Skeleton+ in cartridge form in the AtariAge Store. Included with the cartridge is a colorfully illustrated eight page manual.

Now you can ski all year long without worrying about tight boots, cold hands, long lift lines--or whether it snows!  Skiing by ACTIVISION challenges you with a wide variety of slalom and downhill runs, designed for everyone from amateur to pro.  Even if you've never been on a pair of skiis, you can be a champion skier with Skiing by AACTIVISION.  Read these instructions to find out how to make record-breaking runs without getting wrapped around a tree or crashing into a gate.

~From the Manual

Skiing is one of the few games that replicate this familiar winter sport on the Atari 2600, and does it very well at that. You can either take on a slalom run, with time penalties assessed for any missed gates, or go for a downhill run, where the objective is to ski the given distance as quickly as possible. The first four game variations for each game type are preset, whereas the fifth one generates a random course every time, providing for a new challenge each time you play. Players who could beat a time of 28.2 seconds on game three could earn an Activision Ski Team patch. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

Sky Jinks was programmed by Bob Whitehead, best known for programming games such as Chopper Command, Private Eye, and Stampede. You are in a pylon race in your P41 plane, trying to complete the course in the shortest time possible, so you can earn the coveted Thompson Trophy. You must pass red pylons on the right and blue ones on the left, with a three second penalty given for each missed pylon. There are five game variations, each one getting more and advanced, with the fifth one generating a new course every time one plays. Players who completed Game 1 in 37 seconds or less without missing any pylons were eligible to receive an Activision Sky Stars patch by sending a photograph of their achievement to Activision.

Also known as Aerial Ace, Sky Patrol was a hot air balloon simulator and was the only Imagic title for the 2600 never to be released. The prototype for this game was shown at the 82 CES show, complete with a mock up of what the production box and label would have looked like.  The picture on the label, displaying World War I vintage biplanes attacking a dirigible,  is interesting as it shows more of what the final game would have looked like if it had been completed

As it stands, the game is playable but very incomplete.  You start the game with a hot air balloon sitting on a launch pad in the middle of a field. You can launch the balloon by filling it with enough hot air, or land it by letting the air out.  The amount of hot air in the balloon is directly controlled by how high the burner flame is, and the burner flame is controlled pushing the joystick up and down.  The height of the burner flame is shown as a red bar at the bottom of the screen.  The green bar displays the amount of fuel for your burner, which is slowly whittled away as you use your burner.  Once the fuel has been completely depleted, your balloon can only hover a few feet off the ground and is completely at the mercy of the wind (so don't let this happen).  If you find yourself having fuel issues, you give yourself unlimited fuel by putting the left difficulty switch in the B position.  The blue bar doesn't appear to be functional, but is probably a distance or damage gauge.  

Pushing right and left will alternate the display between the gauges and your score. 

Although you can control the altitude of your balloon by filling or letting the air out of your balloon, you have no direct control over the direction in which you move.  This is where the wind and those little clouds come in.  By moving around to different altitudes you can catch different wind currents and thus somewhat control what direction you're going.  The direction and speed of the wind currents varies depending on the altitude (there are 9 cloud / wind levels in all), but you can tell which way the wind is blowing by watching which way the clouds drift.  Remember that there is a slight delay between when you add or let air out of your balloon and when you change altitude, so plan accordingly.

According to programmer Brad Stewart, the original object of the game was to attempt to get your balloon from Point A to Point B in as fast a time as possible.  However as time went on the design of the game changed into something a bit more action oriented.  According to the new story line the player is now piloting a WWI observation balloon and trying to avoid being shot down by the German army.  This prototype appears to be of the 'action' version of the game, rather than the earlier 'race' version.

As previously mentioned, the goal of the game is stop enemy troops without being shot down.  Although several of the enemy troops are present in the game, they are completely harmless in this early prototype.  As you lazily drift along you will see tanks and anti-aircraft guns that in the final version of the game would have fired on the player, forcing them to ascend upwards to safety.  There are also factories, hangars, and trees to spot, but these objects will not attempt to fire on the player.  There is also what appears to be a man waving his arms next to an odd object at the end of the course.  It is unknown what this is supposed to represent, but it may be a landing zone.  Spotting each object is worth a set amount of points, but if the ground is not visible when you first see an object you will not earn any points until you move off the screen and come back.

The final version of the game would also have introduced enemy planes, dirigibles, rockets, and possibly trains into the enemy mix, making the game far more challenging.  However development of the game was stopped before any of these could be implemented (although parts of the enemy dirigible graphics appear in the game code).  Although Brad's original vision for Sky Patrol would have probably gotten the cold shoulder from the gaming public (hot air balloon racing isn't exactly mainstream), the action oriented observation balloon version might have been quirky enough to be a niche success.

This game is unplayable on an Atari 2600 without the KidVid controller and three accompanying audiotapes. The game takes cues from the tape about when to advance. This cartridge was sold in a large box that included the tapes and KidVid controller. The other KidVid game, Berenstain Bears, was sold with just the accompanying tapes.

You can now play Smurfs Save the Day with the full audio thanks to the Atari 2600 z26 emulator. For more information, please visit our Kid Vid Audio Page.

Kidvid Audio Page:

In 1983, Coleco created an interesting accessory for the Atari 2600: the Kid Vid Voice Module. This accessory connects to the second controller port of the Atari 2600 and allows games to play audio from cassette tapes in sync with the action on the screen. The Kid Vid Voice Module also doubles as a portable cassette player, "portable" being relative to when it was introduced. Only two games were ever released that took advantage of the Kid Vid: Smurfs Save The Day (included with the Kid Vid) and Berenstain Bears (sold separately).

The only way to experience the Kid Vid games as Coleco intended is to use the z26 emulator with the audio files below. To use these files with z26, first make sure you have at least version 1.54 of z26 installed. Then download the audio files and place them into the same directory as z26. You can then launch Berenstain Bears and Smurfs Save the Day and experience them with the original audio. To select a tape to play, press 1, 2, or 3. To rewind a tape, press F1.

But why in the world that greedy snail is always hiding somewhere to rub off my nuts just like those highway men?  (LOL... I swear the box says this ~Rx)

Once thought to have never even been started, Snow White turned up on Ebay back in 2000 with an ungodly reserve price.  Even though the bids (which were in excess of $1,500) never met the reserve, the prototype was sold to an individual afterwards.  While the game may not be complete, it gives us a glimpse at what Atari had in mind for their next Disney title.  Your task is to guide the Seven Dwarfs through the enchanted forest as they search for Prince Charming who must save Snow White from the evil queen.  

The first thing you'll notice about Snow White are the excellent graphics on the title screen.  The Old English lettering is well done, considering how blocky the 2600's graphics usually are.  The next screen shows how many dwarves you have in reserve, and how close the Queen with the poisoned apple is to Snow White.  Since there are seven dwarves in the movie, you get seven attempts to save Snow White.  The "Queen Timer" at the top of the screen is very similar to the one used in Dukes of Hazzard with Boss Hog and Daisy Duke.  After your dwarf marches off, you are taken to the mine scene.

If you successfully find the path out of the evil forest the Evil Queen will be chased off by Prince Charming and you'll be rewarded with a victory screen showing the dwarves dancing around while some cool music plays.  There may have been a better ending planned as this is still an early prototype, but 2600 games were never known for complex endings.

Snow White was ultimately canceled due to managerial indecision.  The marketing managers couldn't make up their minds on what kind of game they wanted, and were changing their minds daily (such as changing the game to a non-action title based around the magic mirror).  Greg decided to shelve Snow White until management could make up their minds, and went to work on another 2600 game called Mark of the Mole (which also went unreleased).  However Atari began to collapse and Greg left the company before Snow White could be finished.

This game was never listed in any of Atari's catalogs or literature, and it was never mentioned in any gaming magazines at the time. In fact the only hint that it was planned was found on internal product number lists at Atari (as CX26107 Snow White/Disney), so when a prototype (dated 11-9-82) was first found in 1999, it was a complete surprise to nearly everyone, especially since it was quite playable, and appeared to be nearly finished.  It was shown at CGE both that year and the next. In 2002, boxed copies - limited to 250 - were produced and sold by Retrodesign.

In 2006 another prototype (dated 2-9-83) was found.  However, this version was vastly different from the one made 3 months earlier.  How strange that the earlier version was apparently abandoned in favor of a completely redesigned one, which was (at this point) far less playable/complete.

In doing research for my upcoming book about the videogame market (see below for more info), I spoke with a former designer from Atari, Greg Easter, who described 2 of the games he worked on during his time there.  Snow White happened to be one of them.

According to Greg, when he was hired at Atari, "Snow White was one of the ones that they had already made the deal with Disney for, but they didn't have anyone working on it. The scripted Snow White logo and the characters in that game were all designed by Mimi Nyden, who was one of about four artists working in another part of the same building."

In regards to the earlier version, "The first scene with the dwarf running through the mine actually was my idea, but the other two scenes were pure marketing. The second scene they stole from the Frogger arcade game. The final scene in the game, which is supposed to be the Magic Forest, is completely abstract. As one programmer put it, 'So this dwarf just runs along in the forest until he accidentally steps on a nail?'  Which is about what it looks like. I knew it was ridiculous when I was writing the code, but I didn't care because I considered myself a hired gun."

He went on to explain how the two different versions came to be: "There were many versions of the Snow White game. In fact I started officially calling it 'Snow White and the Seven Versions' as different people in marketing kept wanting different things. This is how it became a 3-scene game, in an effort to please everyone."

It seems the later version ended up being completed and was close to being released (his notes below describe what the ending was intended to be).  Says Greg: "Snow White made it all the way through product testing, focus testing (in which they brought in children to play the game, with psychologists writing reports on how the children reacted to the game), and packaging design/artwork. If Atari had lasted just a few more weeks, it would have been on the shelves."

MISSION: SURVIVAL

Earth has just about had it, Solar Fox.  Centuries of waste have brought us to the brink of global war for control of what precious energy resources we have left.  There's only one chance for peace - you!  In a far corner of the galaxy hover vast, intricate formations of solar energy cells guarded by ominous, fireball-shooting Sentinels.  Your mission is to navigate through those matrixes and capture those cells!  The faster your speed, the greater your reward.  Your Starships utilize advanced gyro-directional technology, but the only weapon you have is your skill as a pilot.  And the supreme test of that skill will take place in the infamous Challenge Racks, where you'll attempt to unravel the ultimate mystery of your mission.  Good luck, Solar Fox!

OBJECT OF THE GAME

The object of SOLAR FOX is to successfully maneuver your Starship through a series of colorful, pulsating solar cell matrixes.  Points are scored for each solar cell you capture and for how fast you clear each matrix.  Players may also earn the right to complete Challenge Racks for bonus points and clues to the mystery of SOLAR FOX.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

Blast Those Cobra Ships, Mechnoids, and Raiders Before They Blast You!

The Zylons are back -- those spaceway sneaks, villains of Venus, Saturnian scoundrels! They're swarming through the galaxy in huge forces, attempting another takeover. They've got to go! And we need YOU to go get 'em.

But it's a hush-hush missions. If the Zylons guess you're onto them, you're a goner. So the official report says you're out to find the lost planet Solaris and rescue the Atarian Federation Pioneers stranded there. But if the Zylons reach Solaris before you do, they'll destroy it.

You've got to hyperwarp from quadrent to quadrent, facing vicious attackers such as Kogalon Star Pirates, Planet Destroyers, and Cobra Fleet. But don't worry -- your fighter, the StarCruiser, is specially outfitted with a Galactic Scanner and plenty of photon torpedoes. Just don't let the Zylons destroy a Federation Planet, or your quadrant mutates into a terrifying Red Zone. 

Ready? Then hop into the StarCruiser, rev the engine, and go! And remember -- if anything flies your way, blast it!

What starts out as a routine hunt for salvage in the far reaches of the galaxy turns into a white-knuckle fight for survival in Solar Plexus, the first Atari 2600 release by independent game developer JessCREATIONS*, Co. It'll take sharp reflexes to keep your starskimmer full of fuel and away from the wildly unpredictable artificial sun which threatens to make every move your last!

The Solar Plexus increases in speed and mutates into new, more dangerous forms as you continue to play. If one fiery orb bouncing around the screen was hard enough for you to handle, just wait until you have to deal with two, or even three of them! Only the best players will last long enough to witness the final form of this relentless foe.

Solar Plexus can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store. Included with the package is one Solar Plexus game cartridge and an eight page instruction manual, featuring helpful gameplay tips and a full-color illustration by artist Nathan Strum.

You're strapped in your laser ship, battling fierce Deltoids and Shields. They approach in waves, at faster and faster speeds. Each raider can shoot a single flash of proton energy that comes at you like a lightning bolt.

There's no time to waste. And no place to hide. Then, as you carry on the defense, things get much worse. A far-off sun explodes! Fragments from the cataclysm come raining down. Keep moving!

Blast almost everything you see! If you don't, heat from the solar debris can destroy your planet. If you prevail, you can move out to the edge of space and attack your foes. Sweet revenge!

~From the Manual

Defend your planet in this vertical shooter from Imagic. Solar Storm tries to keep you on your toes by pitting you against waves of solar debris and evil Deltoid fighters that will try and pass you to hit the planet below. If too many pass you by, your planet will overheat and the game will be over. If you reach a certain score you enter a bonus round with a zoomed out view where you can see your whole planet, allowing you to take shots at passing Deltoid ships. After the bonus round, normal gameplay resumes, with a faster wave of enemies for you to defend against.

Solar Storm's graphics are actually quite colorful, and flicker-free for the most part. Gameplay can be slightly frustrating as the enemy's shots are lightning fast and you have no shields, but you have the same type of laser as your enemies at the very least. Solar Storm is the only Imagic game that makes use of the paddle controllers, which actually works well for this type of game. (Contributed by Shaggy the Atarian)

The Magic Hat

It started out as a perfectly normal day for a Sorcerer's Apprentice. Prefectly normal...until the apprentice, Mickey Mouse, began daydreaming about the Sorcerer's hat!

"If only I had that magic hat," said Mickey, "I'd never have to work again!"

But, alas, Mickey did not have the hat - and there was still much to do. He already swept the cavern floor, made the beds, and was about to begin his most difficult job.

Mickey picked up two empty buckets and started wearily up the dimly-lit staircase.  It was time to fill the Sorcerer's big tub with water.

It seemed like such a shame to work so hard with all the magic in that hat!  After all, if the Sorcerer got his magic powers from the hat, why couldn't Mickey?  All he would have to do is point his fingers like the Sorcerer always did and...POOF!  He could turn dust into butterflies and winter into spring.

Just then, a huge shadow with two glaring eyes appeared over Mickey.  It was the Sorcerer.  "Mickey Mouse," he said, "if you don't sop daydreaming and get back to work, you'll never be fit to wear a magician's hat!  Now get going!"

Mickey trudged up the stairs to the well outside.  When he returned to the cavern, the Sorcerer was gone.  But there, glowing softly in the middle of the table, was the Sorcerer's magic hat!

"Now I can be a great magician," said Mickey as he dropped the buckets on the floor.  He glanced around the room to make sure he was alone.  Then he put the magic hat on his head.  It was a perfect fit!

"Hmmm, I've got an idea!" said Mickey as he stared wide-eyed at his old broom leaning against the wall.

Mickey pointed his fingers at the broom.

The broom quivered.

Mickey imagined the broom with two arms and two legs.  Instantly, the broom sprouted arms and legs and began sweeping around the room.

"Broom!" ordered Mickey.  "Fill buckets with water from the well and pour them into the Sorcerer's tub."

The broom did exactly what Mickey commanded.  Picking up the nearest bucket with both hands, the broom swept up the stairs and out the door to the well.

Mickey was so delighted, he sang and danced around the room.

"Tra-la-la, tra-la-li, oh how happy life can be!"

"No more work for me!" Mickey cried as he fell into the Sorcerer's chair.  The candlelight flickered in Mickey's tired eyes.  He thought how wonderful it would be to have a whole army of brooms to do all his work....

"Work, broom, work..." he muttered, nodding his weary head, and drifted off to sleep.

Mickey dreamed he was the greatest sorcerer in the world.  He dreamed  of steep mountains surrounded by bright meteors and shining stars that danced at his every command.

Yes, Mickey was a magnificent magician indeed!  His magic had completely changed everything!  Stars no longer blinked politely from a distant galaxy but exploded and fell like fireworks.  It was all great fun until suddenly...something wet and cold woke Mickey up!

The broom was flooding the room with water and Mickey was floating up the stairs.

"Stop broom!" cried Mickey.  "Stop right now!"

But the broom did not stop.

Mickey tried everything!  He even tried grabbing the buckets away.  But the broom pushed Mickey down and kept right on going.

When Mickey stood up, a whole army of brooms, buckets in hand were charging down the staircase, ready to dump more water on the cavern floor.

Poor Mickey!  What a magical mess!  Help him stop the brooms before the Sorcerer's cavern turns into a subterranean sea!

Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.

As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.

Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.

To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.

The intergalactic treaty of 2345 has been broken by a race known as the G'ohrn. You are on patrol in the Gamma Sector of the Dyni'bian Cluster when you receive a distress call from Earth outpost #4. Your mission is to defend the remote Earth outpost.

In Space Battle, you must defend a remote Earth outpost from attacking invaders! But it's not as easy as it sounds--before you can even face the enemy onslaught, you must first land your ship on the outpost's defense platform while evading an enemy sentry! Once on the platform, you will then face the first wave of enemy fighters. Can you destroy them before depleting your fuel supply? To keep your fuel from running low, be sure to pick up the fuel pods released by exploding enemy vessels!

After you destroy the first wave, you'll then be faced with two morphing Kh'rylian Destroyers, and not only do they not drop fuel pods but they require several shots to destroy! And should you survive their fury, you won't have time for a break, as the enemies will send wave after wave of invaders to test your mettle!

Game Variations:

 - Standard Play
 - Steerable Laser Fire
 - No Shields
 - Disappearing Enemies

Space Battle may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

You are in command of a Mark XIV intergalactic star-cruiser in an uncharted quadrant of outer space. You land on a mysterious planet riddled with a suterranean maze of tunnels and caverns inhabited by savage Electrosauri whose horns generate electro-molecular charges capable of disintegrating you and your crew. Your photon ray pistol is activated by the joystick and the fire button. The iridescent eyes of the electrosauri light the cavern walls with eerie flashes as they stalk you, their horns crackling and sizzling. If even one blast of electro-molecular energy strikes you, your skeleton will glow inside your body as the bio-molecular compounds of your body disintegrate.

WARNING: Beware the savage attack of the shaggy marsupods.

You left Planet Earth just moments ago for routine moon-based primary-satellite scout duty.  You are commanding a squadron consisting of three heavily armed Mark 16 Starcruisers.  Suddenly you are attacked by alien enemy raiders energizing from the ether...obviously molecularly energized from a distant galaxy.  They fire neutron missiles which will destroy your Starcruiser upon impact.

Your mission is to destroy the alien enemy ships until reinforcements can arrive from Planet Earth.  These arrive at the approximate rate of one Starcruiser every 10,000 points.  The enemy's arsenal also consists of Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles which are fired sparingly. 

WARNING: As the battle progresses, the enemy grows desperate and fires the Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles more frequently.

In Space Fight you are patrolling Earth's orbit. The computer manages your flight path and locates vessels crossing into the system.

Your job is simple - each time the computer displays a vessel, you decide whether to press the button.

Hostile vessels must be destroyed, or they will attack you. Earth vessels must NOT be destroyed, or you will lose points (and if you destroy a starbase you won't be able to refuel).

Keys are A,Z, S,X (or on the 2600, Up/Down/Left/Right on the left joystick). You can figure out what they do. Space bar (or fire button on the 2600) to fire. Shields reduce the damage you take if hit. Engine speed adjusts how quickly you encounter vessels. Both take fuel. Game ends when all fuel is exhausted.

Space Instigators is a version of the popular arcade game Space Invaders that is more faithful to the original than Atari's 2600 port. This version fits nine invaders in a row without flicker, an impressive feat on the Atari 2600. The graphics, colors and sounds are truer to the original version than Atari's effort.

You can purchase Space Instigators in cartridge form, complete with an instruction card and plastic storage case, from the AtariAge Store.

Each time you turn on SPACE INVADERS you will be at war with enemies from space who are threatening the earth. Your objective is to destroy these invaders by firing your "laser cannon." You must wipe out the invaders either before they reach the earth (bottom of the screen), or before they hit you three times with their "laser bombs."

Your long-term objective is to score as many points as possible. Points are scored each time you hit one of the SPACE INVADERS. They are worth different amounts of points, depending on their initial position on the screen. (See SCORING)

If you destroy all 36 SPACE INVADERS before they reach the earth, a new set of invaders will appear on the screen. Each time the invaders are reset on the screen they will start from a position closer to the earth until they reach the closest position possible. The SPACE INVADERS can be reset on the screen indefinitely during a game.

A variety of enemy weapons and obstacles appear on the right and move toward your space ship.  These include tanks, jet planes, prop planes and helicopters, which all fire at you.  Additionally, there are balloons, houses and trees that do not fire but are obstacles capable of destroying your Attack Saucer upon impact. 

Your objective is to shoot down as many of the enemy objects as possible, scoring as many points as possible, while at the same time avoiding enemy fire.

Initially you have a fleet of three space ships available to you.  For each 1,000 points you can score, an additional ship will be available to you.

It is the 101st Shuttle mission of the Space Transportation System.  You are at the helm of the Space Shuttle Discovery.  Approximately 210 nautical miles above the Earth is your target: an orbiting satellite with intentionally programmed gyroscope problems.

Your mission is to launch, rendezvous, and dock with the satellite as many times as you can, using the minimum of fuel, then return safely to Earth. A word of caution: Each time you successfully dock, the satellite has been programmed to become even more erratic.

This is a total test of your piloting capabilities.  You will be evaluated at the end of your flight.

~From the Manual

Space Shuttle was truly a technical achievement for the Atari 2600 in the sense that it introduced a fairly sophisticated technical simulation to the Atari 2600, and it required the user to make use of just about every switch on the console. Special overlays, one for the six switch model and one for the four switch model, were included with the game, as well as a reference sheet and a rather thick manual. Simply put, the objective of just launching the shuttle is a very big task in that the player must monitor several item, make sure everything is set up properly, and then make sure they don't make any critical mistakes, otherwise the launch will be aborted. Once the player successfully makes it to space and into orbit, the game's excellent graphics are really shown to the fullest. 

Your goal once in orbit is to dock with a satellite one or more times before returning to Earth. The player needs to take care that their shuttle is properly configured for reentry to avoid burning up in the atmosphere or crashing upon landing. A player who managed to complete four dockings and return with at least 4,500 units of fuel would earn a Space Shuttle Pilot patch from Activision upon submitting a photo demonstrating said requirements were met. If a player was truly good enough, and completed six dockings and returned with at least 7,500 units of fuel, they would get a special message, and sending a photograph of that would allow them to receive a special Space Shuttle Commander patch.

Your planet, a peaceful Class M world, has always been living in harmony and this allowed its people to quickly evolve into the space era. Anyway, as you might have guessed, no good is going to last. There came a time where the forces of evil, namely your neighbor planet, started to strike against you. The evil planet's inhabitants are quite different. They don't care about nature and peace. They are greedy, and only think about consuming the planet's sources to gain more and more riches. This quickly led to a total draining of anything their planet had to offer, making them more and more envious of your prospering world. Unable to obtain any more of their environment, the evil planet sent its combat drones to attack your world, aiming at stealing your food resources. Unfortunately, they're succeeding in getting their tentacles on your valuable goods, trapping them in a space cage above your planet...

OBJECT OF THE GAME
------------------
Your mission is to bring back as much food as possible before the drones take it away with them.

In Space Treat Deluxe, you control a ship that must reach the top of the screen, collect the tasty treat located there, and get it back to its base at the bottom. The original version of Space Treat was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. This new version adds several improvements to the original, including:

 - Scoring
 - Hi-Score feature
 - More stable graphics
 - 7800 compatibility
 - Wider emulators compatibility
 - Various cosmetic and audio improvements

Space Treat Deluxe can be purchased from the AtariAge Store, complete with a full-color, eight page manual created by Dale Crum.

You and your opponent blast off into space. Each player controls one Star Ship with the Joystick Controller. The object is to score points by shooting your opponent's Star Ship with missiles fired by the red button on your Joystick Controller. Aim the nose of your Star Ship in the direction you want to fire. Space War games last ten minutes or until one player scores ten points. Player's scores appear at the top of the playfield and are color coordinated with the Star Ships. The two lines to the right of your score refer to fuel and missile supply. The top line is the fuel gauge; the bottom line is the amount of missiles remaining. Each player begins with eight missiles. Once the arsenal is depleted, the game will automatically reset each player with eight more missiles ONLY when both players are out of missiles. In most War games, fuel cannot be resupplied. In games 6 and 7, players can refuel and resupply missiles by docking with the Starbase. 

Fuel is used by adding "thrust" to your Star Ship or by putting your Ship into Hyperspace.

BECOMING A MASTER BUG BLASTER

Tips from Larry Miller, designer of Spider Fighter

As you can see, keeping a fruit orchard isn't exactly easy.  Those bugs can really become a nuisance.  You can never get rid of them entirely, but you can control them.

There are various strategies you can experiment with, but one of the most effective that I have found is to first gun down the lone Spy Pod.  If you can exterminate that Pod, you halt the flow of reinforcements.  Afterwards, you can pick off the rest of the attackers, leaving the Master Nest for last. 

Occasionally, the Master Nest will release a continuous stream of Spy Pods, and each one you hit seems to be replaced.  If this happens, you must immediately destroy the Master Nest and take your chances against a squadron full of angry Stingers.  Normally, though, it is best to destroy the slower Spy Pods and Green Widows that hover near the bottom of the screen before killing the Master Nest.  A low-flying Stinger is your worst enemy.

So maintain a stiff upper lip, and send me a line in between Spider fights. I'd sure like to know how this year's fruit harvest will fare.

~From the Manual

Spider Fighter is a colorful and fast-paced shooter in which you must protect your orchard from wave after wave of egg-laying, fruit stealing spiders. Each kind of spider you kill affects the game differently; shoot the spy pods and no more reinforcements come out, shoot the master nest and all the spiders start shooting you! Anyone scoring 40,000 points or more could send in a picture of their achievement and recieve the Spider Fighter patch! (Contributed by panda_racer)

You are Spike, climbing against time.  Rather than following the safer way of the path, you may decide to climb the cliff instead... but such a decision will change your speed and your technique. Completing 5 different screens will take you to the top of the mountain, but beware of diving  eagles, and hungry bears that hide in darkened caves.  You must also watch for rock slides and slippery ice patches... they may send you sliding, perhaps into poisonous mountain cactus.  The higher you climb, the colder you'll get So hurry... before you freeze!

    <desc>
Talk about a game with convoluted history!  It was once thought that Spinning Fireball (along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief), were all unreleased games developed by a company called Zimag which may have also been known as Emag or Vidco.  However after some intense research it was discovered that these games may have been developed in Taiwan and simply patched into NTSC format.  

Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.  

The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level.  

While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four). 

While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.

Both of the games that Milton Bradley released on the Atari 2600 came with special controllers. Spitfire Attack came with the Flight Commander and Survival Run was shipped with the Cosmic Commander. Both controllers are functionally equivalent to a joystick, so you do not need them to play the games today. Also, both games shipped with a sheet of stickers to be applied to the controller, as well as an end label to be attached to the cart. This is why it is common to find Survival Run and Spitfire Attack without an end label.

Speed into the Sprint Master hall of fame! Choose your track, from practice-caliber squares to the curvaceous championship courses. Rev up at the starting line, and take off!

Keep a good grip on the controls. You'll need a delicate touch and a cool head to avoid sliding into the wall on those arcing curves.

Watch your time. Take advantage of the bonus speed and traction boxes at the necessary moments. Grab the lead on the first lap, or let your challenger outpace you and then make him eat dust in the final laps.

Outrace an opponent, or go at it again to beat your own time. Sprint to the finish and win!

It seems ridiculous - and too good to be true. Are there really suitcases full of money at the top of those unfinished buildings downtown? The ones still under construction? And those suitcases, they're just there for the taking? You would never have believed it except that the guy who told you about it, a regular union guy like you, just bought a brand new Corvette. You know that two weeks ago he didn't have that kind of money, so you guess he's telling the truth. When you asked him how come he didn't get the rest of the suitcases, he got an odd look on his face and wouldn't say another word. Strange...

Your objective in Squish 'Em is to climb those 48-floor buildings to grab the cash-filled suitcase at the top of each one. As if scaling the heights of the buildings was not dangerous enough, you have to be alert for falling bricks from above and watch for creepy critters who've made these buildings their home! Once you reach the top of each building, you can grab the suitcase and continue to the next building.

Along the way you'll encounter a wide range of critters that you must avoid or jump over. You can even squish the creatures with your feet, but you can only squish each creature once before they turn white with rage and pop back up, looking for revenge! Once a creature has turned white you cannot squish it again! In addition to the creatures, each building has a bonus item that you can collect to receive an extra man.

Squish 'Em was written by veteran Atari 2600 homebrew author Bob Montgomery, who has several previous 2600 homebrew games under his belt, including Go Fish!, Reindeer Rescue, and Elevators Amiss. Squish 'Em is a near flawless port of the old Atari 8-bit computer name of the same name--fans of the original game will be pleased to see this impressive and addictive incarnation of the game on the Atari 2600!

Squoosh was known to exist for many years after being discovered by prototype collector John Earney back in the late 90's.  Unfortunately it was never dumped, and for years people could only speculate at what the game look liked or what the gameplay involved.  After John Earney decided to sell off most of his collection Squoosh finally made its way into the hands of another collector who had it dumped for the gaming community. 

Much like Apollo's other famously unfinished game Pompeii, Squoosh is an unplayable demo showing what the game screen would have looked like.  You control a French guy (complete with berete) who can move left and right around the screen, and jump with the fire button.  In the middle of the screen is a giant press with a covered pit underneath it.  When you start the game a grape will come bouncing in from the right side of the screen, and proceed to roll back and forth along the floor.  The concept of this game was to have your guy kick or move grapes into the center of the screen where the press would come down and 'squoosh' them into wine (which would collect in the pit below).  

Unfortunately there is no gameplay implemented in this early prototype, so once you've run around the screen and watched the grape roll about, you've seen all there is to do in this game.  The press in the middle of the screen appears to be operational (moving by itself), but the only thing you can squoosh in this prototype is yourself.  If you stand underneath the press and press the jump button, you will be knocked down into the pit and be trapped until you reset the game (one of your little men in your life reserves counter will fall down indicating you have died). 

While it may not look like much in this early prototype, Squoosh may have turned out to be one of the more original titles from Apollo.  It seems that Apollo was finally getting around to making interesting games around the time the market was crashing. Apollo was one of the first companies to throw in the towel, so many of their games never got past the early prototype stage.  Squoosh probably wouldn't have been the game that saved Apollo, but at least it was an original concept in an era of "Me Too" clones.  Had there been more original ideas like this the crash may not have happened, of course companies with poor games like Apollo are what caused the crash in the first place.

You are a daring big game hunter on an expedition into the heart of the Amazon's legendary lost world. But you find that the game being hunted is you -- by Pterodactyls, Trachodons, and other prehistoric creatures. Luckily you find refuge in an ancient abandoned fortress, where you're protected from the jungle outside. Or are you . . . . .

Expedition Objectives

Your objective is to score as many points as possible by shooting the prehistoric creatures that prowl outside the ancient fortress walls. But at the same time you must avoid contact with the deadly snakes that can slither in and out of your jungle hiding place.

Climb into your saddle and start ridin'! You'll want to practice playing your horse and rider in the right position to rope and herd those dogies without letting any get by you - and to dodge any surprises on the trail.

To rope: position your horse directly behind the dogie you wish to lasso. The rope will always be thrown directly in front of your horse, and the loop must touch a dogie in order to rope him. If you attempt to rope a steer which is too far away or too close, you'll come up empty. When you get more at home on the range, you'll know the right time to throw your rope. It's impossible to score well if you can't keep the game going long enough to rope a passel (?) of dogies. The only way to do that successfully is to keep the cattle in a herd in front of you. Herding is as important as roping in helping you run up your score. When you ride just behind one of the dogies, you'll notice he'll speed up and run further out in front of your horse. Since all dogies do not run at the same speed, you will have your work cut out for you to keep them all together and ahead of you.

~From the Manual

In Stampede you are a cowboy who must rope up as many calves as he can. Your movement is restricted to the vertical axis, and you must learn how to herd the cattle as they run by to maximize your score. When you start the game you have three freebies, that is you can miss up to three calves before the game ends. The four types of calves travel at different speeds, brown are fast, tan/yellowish are medium fast, pale yellow are slow and the black angus doesn't move at all (but they are worth the most points). If you sent in a picture of your score of 3,000 points or higher to Activision, you'd receive an Activision Trail Drive patch. (Contributed by panda_racer)

Star Fire is a new Atari 2600 game programmed by Manuel Polik, who previously created Gunfight for the 2600. Star Fire is a port of the 1979 arcade game of the same name created by David Rolfe and Ted Michon and released by Exidy. Star Fire is a wave-based space shoot'em-up, with several surprises that you won't find in the original arcade game. It carefully tries to not only adopt most features of the original, but to enhance the gameplay whereever possible as well.

Star Fire Elite SquadronStar Fires features include:

- Title tune and warp sequence by Paul Slocum!

- Animated title screen by Thomas Jentzsch!

- Realtime calculation of up to 9 double sized, independent moving space objects!

- Intelligent Anti-Flicker engine!

- 9 different starting waves of increasing difficulty

Star Fire can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store, complete with an original label and manual designed by Dve Exton.

The first 50 pilots who purchased Star Fire and sent in valid proof of a score above 3,500 points were awarded with a unique Star Fire Patch and Elite Squadron Acceptance Letter. You can view members of the Star Fire Elite Squadron here.

You are alone in space.  A critical and difficult mission awaits you. Carefully read these instructions and commit them to memory.  Then, study "The Power of StarMaster."  It will help to instruct you in the ways of advanced space combat.  And then, perhaps someday, YOU can attain the level of Supreme StarMaster.

PILOT BRIEFING

You must protect your starbases by destroying all invading enemy starfighters before they destroy you or your starbases.  You must accomplish your mission quickly, using the least amount of energy, sustaining the least damage. Succeed, and you will be rewarded.  Fail, and you will be destroyed.  The destiny of the galaxy is in your hands.

~From the Manual

The first person space shooter was a popular genre on the Atari 2600. Activision's entry into the fray is Starmaster. While Atari's own Star Raiders required a keypad to control the functions of your starship, Starmaster used the 2600's color/black and white switch to toggle your star map screen on and off. This allowed for a deeper game play experience, while still keeping things simple. 

Your job is simply to defend all of the starbases in the area by destroying enemy ships. Taking hits while battling out the enemy results in your ship taking damage. Your warp drive can be destroyed, weapon systems disabled, shields eliminated, or radar destroyed. The only way to repair this damage (and refuel your ship) is to dock with a local starbase. 

Your game ends when either all enemies are destroyed or your ship is eliminated. Any Mission Evaluation score of Star Master in the game qualified you to be inducted into the Order of the Supreme StarMaster. Lower ranks made you eligible to receive commendations as well. Sending a picture of your score to Activision would result in your receiving a Starmaster patch commemorating your excellent score! (Contributed by Lord Helmet)

DESTROY THE KRYLONS...	AVENGE THE DOOMED PLANET!

With Commander Champion and Li San O'Rourke in the Star Fighter, you're on the tail of the Krylon invaders.  You've taken an oath to destroy the Krylons and avenge the Doomed Planet.

Through interstellar space you hyperwarp faster than the speed of light, past uncharted stars and planets in an unexplored parallel universe.  Watch out!  You nearly collided wit an asteroid.  Run into an asteroid at this speed, and POW!  you're space dust.  Good thing the Star Fighter's protective shields are on.

Check the Krylons' position on your Galactic Map.  Looks like they're heading for your starbase.  Given half a chance they'll destroy it to keep you from recharging and repairing the Star Fighter.  Their ships are fast, but you can hyperwarp anywhere in the galaxy in an instant...  if your energy supply holds out. It's a duel to the death.  Will you succeed in destroying the Krylons before they wipe out the starbase?  Will the Star Fighter perish like the Doomed Planet?  Or will you complete your mission and return a hero?

You're sitting in your Star Ship cockpit.  And your television screen is suddenly transformed into the window of your Star Ship.  With the Joystick Controller, steer the ship deep into space.  A constant barrage of meteors whiz toward your window.  Eerie Enemy Space Objects float from the darkest parts of space.

Your mission in space is to destroy Enemy Space Objects to score points. You are helpless against asteroids -- they can NOT be destroyed.  Lose one point when an Enemy Space Object or asteroid crashes into your ship.  Score one point when you destroy a star fighter.  Score two points when you zap a flying saucer or space module.  A space robot is worth three points when you destroy it.

Returning from a secret diplomatic mission, the Astro-Cruiser Star Voyager receives an urgent stellar communication: "Zakor has betrayed new treaty. Capital Starport under siege. Relief imperative. Return immediately. Caution: Zakoran enemy ships patrol the seven star portals. Energy supplies limited: Refuel at each star portal. Hurry!"

OBJECTIVE

Pilot Star Voyager through treacherous space. As you look out from the Command Bridge, stars rush past. Penetrate the seven star portals and save the Capital Starport. Destroy enemy ships with photon torpedoes or lasers, or evade them to maintain your precious energy supply.

Keep track of energy levels on the instrument panel. Use your radar screen to locate opponents and approaching star portals. Only passing through a star portal restores your energy reserves. But be warned! Crashing into a star portal will destroy you!

~From the Manual

Star Voyager is somewhat similar to Star Raiders and Starmaster, except that it is somewhat simpler and more straightforward in terms of gameplay. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship, the Astro-Cruiser Star Voyager, back to the Capital Starport and and save it from the evil Zakoran forces, who have violated a recent peace treaty by attacking. You can control the speed of the action with the left difficulty switch, and the right difficulty switch toggles between lasers and torpedoes. 

Star Voyager's gameplay is pretty straightforward in that you must simply shoot the enemies before they shoot you, then try to pilot your ship through the star portal. The ultimate goal is to get through all seven star portals, but the difficulty of this game is very intense, making it harder than it sounds. When you have completed a mission, you receive a ranking based on how well you did. You can also play with two people, either cooperatively as pilot and weapons officer, or competitively, with another person controlling the enemy fighters. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

The Empire's revenge has begun!  Right now an army of Imperial Walkers is marching toward the Rebels' power generator on the Ice Planet Hoth.  If they reach it, the entire Rebel base will blow sky high!  To stop them, the Rebels must rely on their missile-firing Snowspeeders.  The Snowspeeders may be tiny (compared to the gigantic Imperial Walkers) but they're quick and agile.  And in the hands of a skillful commander, they can destroy the mighty Walkers!

So climb into your Snowspeeder and be prepared to meet the first of your deadly enemies!


OBJECT

The object of the game is to destroy as many of the Imperial Walkers as you can before they reach the power generator at the end of the battlefield - or before the Imperial Walkers destroy your fleet of Snowspeeders.

On October 29, 2007 I was invited to take part in the 5th annual AtariAge Holiday Cart. The plan for this years cart was to have a number of "mini games" with a slick menu to tie the games together. I contacted my nephew, Justin, for some game ideas and he suggested "You're Frosty collecting stuff" and "You're Rudolf, running away from the other reindeer because they're taunting you". 

The levels in the game were designed by myself, Nathan Strum and David Vazquez (who did graphics, animation, label and game manual artwork for Medieval Mayhem). The graphics in Stay Frosty were all done by Nathan Strum.

The object of Steeplechase is to be the first player to advance your horse to the right side of the screen display.  Each horse gallops at a given speed from left to right.  While the horse gallops, hurdles of different sizes approach the horse from right to left.  Your task is to jump and clear the hurdles, and get your horse to the right side first.

As you are jumping each hurdle, your horse actually has no motion from left to right.  Whenever you hit a hurdle your horse loses some horizontal position (distance) while it falls to the ground and gets up.  The higher you jump your horse, the easier it is to clear all hurdles.  However, the more time it takes to clear the hurdles, and the more time it takes to reach the right side of the screen.

The height of a jump can be set by adjusting your height indicator bar. There are four height settings.  Each horse has its own height indicator bar.

History of the Interstellar Conflict

It is 2000 years since the unification of our planet and we "Terrans" have peacefully excelled in art, philosophy, and science.  Our technology has mastered all but one problem, the hyperwarp drive (which would allow us to travel to other planets).  Trapped in our own solar system for lack of the hyperwarp drive, there seems to be no way out until we are discovered by extraterrestrial life.  These "Aliens" are anxious to trade their hyperwarp technology for Terran art and science to revitalize their stagnant culture.

As time passes we Terrans expand out empire through interstellar trade and the use of hyperwarp technology.  Increasingly the Terrans and Aliens compete over the riches of the universe.  We develop phased energy weapons (PHASORS) and force shields, while the Aliens insist on escorting their merchant envoys with warships.  Tension begins to grow.

The Terran government, directed by the House of Viceroys, decides to build and indestructible Starfleet and two Galactic Starbases to insure cosmic military  supremacy.  With the invention of a deadly photon-launcher and the virtual invisibility of the starbases (their location is a closely guarded secret), we Terrans feel that a single Super Warship can keep the scattered Alien fleet in check.  You are the captain and sole commander of that warship.

While the Viceroys are relaxing and confident of our military superiority, the Alien Council of Elders rule that the Terran culture has to be destroyed.  This is to be done before Alien dominance in the heavens is lost.  As the commander, you must throw back the Alien invasion.

Mission Objective

The object of your mission is to destroy the Aliens in the galaxy with PHOTONS or PHASORS before they destroy you.  If you run out of time (STARDATES) or fuel (ENERGY), we Terrans are lost!

NOTE:  The complexity of STELLAR TRACK will make it necessary for you to periodically refer to this manual during your first several missions.  It's also a good idea to use a note pad and pencil to keep track of vital information during each mission.

Stell-A-Sketch is an Atari 2600 program that simulates the popular Etch A Sketch toy. It was written for the Supercharger, and would not be possible without the extra memory provided by the Supercharger. Both CD-ROM and Cassette versions were released, and Stell-A-Sketch was bundled with Okie Dokie. Unfortunately, the maker of the real Etch A Sketch, Ohio Art, forced Bob Colbert to stop selling Stell-A-Sketch, so please don't write him asking how you can get a copy. Stell-A-Sketch supports input via an Atari joystick, driving controllers, Amiga mouse, or Atari ST mouse.

Strategy X is one seriously ugly game, but its extreme challenge keeps things interesting.  You control a tank moving up a vertically scrolling screen, blasting enemy cannons while maintaining your fuel supply.  The screen is littered with blocky green "bogs" that slow you down and consume extra fuel.  Besides your moving tank treads, there's not much to see.  You can speed up, slow down, or move side-to-side, but the lack of diagonal movement makes the animation look choppy.  The enemy cannons look rough, but at least they explode nicely.  Enemy shots travel fast and are difficult to elude.  Fuel towers can replenish your fuel supply, but these are also vulnerable to shots fired from the cannons.  If you make it to the "triumphal arch" at the end of the stage, you'll advance to stage two.  This time, you face a squadron of bombers that fire wiggly lines, and it looks even worse than the first stage.

All in all, Strategy X is low in quality, but there's something addictive about its gameplay that kept me coming back for more.

Strat-O-Gems Deluxe is a new Atari 2600 game by John Payson, originally created for the 2005 Minigame Competition that bears similarities to Columns, Jewel Master, and Salu's Acid Drop. In Strat-O-Gems Deluxe, colored gems fall from the top of the screen in groups of three. Any time three or more adjacent gems of the same color line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally they will disappear. Any gems above them will then fall down; if these create new groups of three or more gems, those too will disappear, leading to chain reactions. Your job is to score as many reactions and chain reactions as possible before the gems reach the foul line. If any gems remain over the foul line after all reactions are complete, the game will end.

AtariAge and John Payson sponsored a contest to create original artwork for Strat-O-Gems Deluxe. The winning label artwork appears on all copies of Strat-O-Gems Deluxe, featured on both the cover of the manual and the cartridge label. You read about Strat-O-Gems Deluxe's development in our Homebrew Discussion Forum.

Strat-O-Gems Deluxe can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

Now a video activity game that's full of lively music, colorful matching, and "berry" fun times!  Strawberryland is all mixed up - thanks to the Purple Pieman.  Strawberry Shortcake and her friends Blueberry Muffin, Lime Chiffon, and Huckleberry Pie(tm)* were going to put on a musical talent show.  But the Purple Pieman ruined everything.  He didn't want anyone to have any fun, so he cast an evil spell on them.  Now everyone has a body that's all mixed up - even the Purple Pieman.  Can you put everyone back together the way they're supposed to be?  When you do, the Strawberryland characters will dance for joy!

OBJECT

The object of the game is to correctly "put together" as many Strawberryland characters as you can.

Avoid collisions and score points!  One, 2, 3 or 4 players each control one car on the track playfield.  In one and two-player games, each player uses a separate vertical track.  In three and four-player games, two players share one track.

Each player tests his skill against computer cars.  Use the knob on the Controller to steer your car around the oncoming cars heading straight for you! Press the red Controller buton to increase your speed. 

Score one point for every car you pass.  Your car is color coordinated with your score that appears at the top of the playfield.

Each game is completed after 2 minutes and 16 seconds or when a player or team scores 99 points.  Your score will flash on and off during the final 16 seconds of game time.

You'll hear the hum of the motors, CRASHES, and BEEPS when you score.

This is a simple 1 player game where you try to keep the aliens from stealing all of your planetary barrier. The idea was derived from the old videogame Rip Off. It was mixed with some blockout and space invaders and this game was born. The game ends when all of your barrier has been stripped away by the aliens. You score 30 points for each alien destroyed. When you are down to 10 barrier chunks left the aliens doubles in speed! Your barrier gets replenished every 900 points (30 alien kills).

Destroy the Galactic Trap!

Space-security approaches the abandoned asteroid Stronghold activating a volley of defense drones. Skillfully you must pilot your attack ship through the explosive space-waste; a single scrape will pierce the skin of your fragile ship.

Without warning the bleak surface of the heavily fortified Stronghold is energized by three moving force-shields that protect a lethal asteroid-crawler. The automatic systems of the seemingly derelict Stronghold are functioning perfectly, heat sensor interceptors launch to track and destroy your spacecraft.

Survival depends on blasting through the whirling forceshields and devastating the crawling command center as it fires repeatedly trying to eliminate your frail ship.

The diabolical Stronghold has one last defense mechanism; a magnetic mega-field that forms at the outer limits of the asteroid's atmosphere. Slowly it expands towards the surface trapping you within a diminishing combat zone. Can you fight off the interceptors, blast through the force-shields and exterminate the armored command crawler before your time expires?

Tension mounts as hair-trigger reflexes and unerring accuracy are mandatory for survival. Only you can annihilate the Stronghold and move on through the galaxy to neutralize another, more deadly, space menace.

    <desc>
Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first "Non-Pong" standalone consoles, and was based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making your "Stunt Cycle" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the top of the screen, where you are given two "rows" of screen space to build up speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The "trick" to the game is to build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again.

Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a perfect port of the standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics were in Black and White (which was standard at the time).  Since Atari 2600 games had to have the option of color or B&amp;W, some color was added to the game (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt Cycle was finished and ready to go.

It was around this time that marketing had "brilliant" idea; why not make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  Some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. 

So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved, programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch (which was never released either). 

Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up to another act of Atari mismanagement.

Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never assigned a product number.

Just imagine that you are the captain of a ship, and it's your job to protect your country. Your modern submarine is equipped with many new features to help you. The control panel includes a radar scope, a sonar depth charge detector, status indicators, a fuel readout, an engine temperature gauge, and of course, torpedoes. 

Since you're the commander, you are at the helm. It's up to you to guide the submarine. You'll use your periscope to scan the ocean and detect enemy vessels. When you spot the enemy, launch a 

torpedo. Destroy their ships before they destroy your submarine. Be on the the lookout for dangerous depth charge attacks. A depth charge hit could mean serious damage to your submarine. 

Your submarine is equipped with limited supplies, especially fuel. Keep a constant watch on your fuel and energy levels. Every maneuver costs you fuel. When the fuel runs out, your mission is over. 

We know you can handle the job, so good luck Commander!

Enemy submarines have been detected in your waters.  You command a destroyer which can launch as many as four depth charges at a time.  Your mission is to sink as many enemy subs as possible.

But it's not that simple.  Because SUB-SCAN is more than a shooting match.  It's a game of strategy.  A battle of wits.  Can-and-mouse on the high seas between the hunter above and the hunted below.

If you survive flocks of flying enemies, escape through the high powered flash pulses of the Electro-Gates.  It takes steady nerves to make it! Then, go even deeper to more wild battles.  Keep shooting, and never give up!

~From the Manual

Subterranea is Imagic's entry into the Defender category. Subterranea's gameplay is broken into two types of screens. The first is a side view dogfight between your ship and some hapless enemies that are trying to home in on it. Things heat up in the second (and far more common) type of screen, which consists of Defender-style action minus the humanoids. You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. 

Like Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight. Subterranea awards extra lives not by scoring, but by completing stages without being hit. while Subterranea borrows concepts from other games and doesn't appear to be very original, there's just something about it that keeps you coming back for yet another game.

A Million to One: Those are the odds against you.  Even though you're fast, tough, and smart.  You're simply outnumbered. And the enemy is tough. 

The Bad Guys: Fiendish virus.  Tough to kill, too.  A direct hit with a penicillin torpedo divides the colony.  Hit again, and they divide into creepy little virus.  A third blast pulls their plugs for good.

Most of them just cruise along attacking their host's cells. But watch out for a particularly nasty number who goes straight for your throat.

Batter Up!

The late-summer sun sits high above the ballpark.  The centerfield flags are barely moving.  You can feel the sun's heat reflecting off home plate. The crowd behind you murmurs, afraid to break the spell.  It's the bottom of the ninth, the score is tied, and the pennant is on the line. 

You have a runner on base and only one out.  The pitcher tries to stare you down.  But you know he's getting tired, and his sinker ball is starting to creep up into the strike zone.

Finally he makes the throw.  Your whole body moves into the swing.  With the crack of the bat still ringing in your ears, you head for first.  As you round the bag at first, you look up in time to see a fan in the centerfield bleachers make the catch.  You head for home, and the crowd goes wild! 

You've just won the pennant with a two-run homer.  Now on to the championship!

Imagine you're in a one-man space shuttle travelling through the heavens at the speed of light.  you and your tiny ship are totally engulfed in darkness, except for the luminance of an occasional passing star. 

Suddenly, without warning, there's a brilliant flash straight ahead.  You check the radar screen.  Nothing.  Pretty soon there's another flash, and another.  Next thing you know the flashes have turned into one gigantic force field of some kind and it's dead ahead.  You check the radar screen again, still nothing.

The colors in this mysterious force field are so bright, they're almost blinding.  And they seem to be in layers.  But the stranges thing is that nothing shows up on the radar screen.  What could that mean?  Is it possible to travel through this mysterious force field or will you crash and be destroyed?  And what about the layers?  If you make it through one, can you make it through the next, and the next? 

It's decision time and there are only a few seconds to think about it. Turn back or blast ahead and try to make it through the layers of the brightly colored force field.  It's up to you.

Brush off your ace piloting skills because you're about to take off on a hair-raising adventure: air surveillance of unfriendly territory. This means a 10,000-mile obstacle course through ever-changing terrain...over craggy mountain tops, around tall city buildings, through long jagged tunnels. And that isn't all! The course is just rigged with chopper-stopping weapons like igniting rockets, heavy ground artillery, flying fireballs, and falling mines.

Every 1,000 miles of terrain brings ever-increasing challenges and ever-certain...danger. But a handsome payoff lies at the end for anyone who's got what it takes.

Now you are a talented racing-cars driver.  You will be required to pass lots of cars each day.  Through suburbs, snow, fog, desert and prairie, sunrise to sunset - as fast as you can, as long as you can.  Pay attention to the lighting and scenery.  It represents the time of day, letting you know how much time is remaining.  You will be less tactful to control your steering in snowy road, and have less time to react the coming cars in the fog-shrouded road.

Scramble for the Touchdown

Super Football offers 3-D football action. On screen, you get a full view of the field from above and behind the offensive team. And you control the action as the players line up, kick, run, pass, and score.

You can play Super Football on any one of four game levels. As you advance to higher levels, game play lasts longer and the action heats up. You'll even select formations and patterns to run the game your way. To win, your five-player team has to score more points than your opponent's, with touchdowns, extra points, and field goals.

During game play, the clock runs continuously. There are no time-outs, fumbles, penalties, safeties, or running out of bounds in Super Football, so your game continues uninterrupted while you rack up points.

With Super Football, it's nonstop gridiron action until the final whistle!

You are Superman.  Receiving a tip on a bomb scare, you rush to the Metropolis waterfront.  Dropping into a nearby phone booth, you change into Clark Kent, mild- mannered reporter for the Daily Planet, and continue east (right) toward the Metropolis Memorial Bridge.

As you approach the bridge, it explodes!  Lex Luthor, arch enemy of Superman, is seen leaving in a hell-pack.  Some of the Lex Luthor henchmen rush from the scene.  A helicopter flies by carrying Lois Lane.  Is she in trouble, or has she hired the helicopter to scoop the story?  Another crook sneaks away.

This is a job for Superman!  You rush back to the phone booth and emerge as the Man of Steel.

"Up, up and away" you fly to capture Lex Luthor and his gang.  But beware! Lex Luthor has released three Kryptonite satellites that will seek you out. If any touch you, you become weak.  You will lose your ability to fly, and to capture and hold on to things.  Only a touch from Lois Lane will revive you.

The destroyed Metropolis Memorial Bridge is important to the economy of the city.  Besides catching Lex Luthor and his gang, you must find the three pieces of the Bridge and rebuild it.

The helicopter may try to help, but more than likely it will be a hindrance... sometimes even removing parts of the Bridge that you have put into place.  Other times it is a definite ally by snatching away the Kryptonite satellite that Lex Luthor may be hiding behind.

After putting Lex Luthor and his gang behind bars, and rebuilding the Bridge, you return to the phone booth and change back into Clark Kent.  Then you catch a subway to the Daily Planet and turn in your story.

The Surf's Up and you're ready to go.  But wait..... there's a shark warning.  The only thing to do is jump each time the Shark makes his move.  Not easy when you're riding on top of a wild, pulsating wave.  Any mistake and into the water you go.

Under the thundering surf you find an old sunker Galleon between you and your surfboard.  You only have a few seconds of air to negotiate the distance.  The Galleon is protected by fast moving Octopus.  The walls of the Galleon can change shape and just in case you're not too busy, there's a Jellyfish standing guard by your surfboard.  Make it back on time and you get another ride on the Wild Surf.

The action gets faster and faster.  You test every skill you know plus invent a few new ones, but ride the Wild Surf you will......

Surf's Up was the third and last game to make use of Amiga's JoyBoard controller.  The JoyBoard was a quirky device that you would stand on and lean in the direction you wanted your character to move.  An interesting concept, but it didn't work overly well and only one officially released game (Mogul Maniac) made use of it.  While Amiga's second game Off Your Rocker was sold in limited quantities through Happy Valley Video, Surf's Up was never sold in stores.

In case you haven't guessed, Surf's Up is a surfing game which attempts to use the JoyBoard to mimic a surfboard.  While this may not sound like the easiest thing to simulate on the 2600, Surf's Up does a fairly decent job at it.  There are three different beaches (levels) to choose from: Santa Cruz, Malibu, and Waimea.  Santa Cruz is the easiest, while Waimea is the hardest. 

You control a little yellow surfboard which you can move about the screen in an attempt to "ride the wave".  There are a pair of red lines that represent 'the wave' (so to speak).  While the top line is stationary, the bottom line moves up and down (simulating the movement of the wave).  You can score points by moving towards the top red line when both of them are are touching each other, but if you stay there for too long you'll wipe out so be careful. 

If you have the difficulty switch in the A position you will notice little sea critters moving across the screen.  These creatures will attack you and knock you off your board if you're not careful (Whoa dude!  For real?), so you will need to move your board around the screen to avoid them.  This variation makes the game a heckuva lot more fun, so it is recommended that you play with the game in the A position all the time.  

While the gameplay may be only so-so, the graphics in Surf's Up are very well done.  The title screen shows a little man (who looks like a stick figure) on a surfboard in a rather well drawn ocean scene.  The next screen shows a first person view of the ocean from your surfboard as you pick which level you want to start on.  The main game screen shows your little yellow surfboard on a moving blue ocean with some palm trees, houses, and a mountain (a volcano?) in the background.  The rhythmic roll of the ocean has been nicely implemented with moving blue lines which give you a calm, relaxed feeling. 

All in all Surf's Up isn't really a bad game I suppose, plus it is the only surfing game for the 2600 in the US (unless you count the surfing sequence in California Games).  Using an actual JoyBoard instead of an emulator will enhance the gameplay slightly, but not enough to make me want to play it for more than a few minutes (which is a good thing since the game ends automatically after 2 and a half minutes).  In all fairness to Amiga, they may have still been tweaking the gameplay since this is a prototype.  However I don't see what more could be done to make this game interesting since what you can do is limited by the JoyBoard itself (no wild tricks or dangerous jumps would be possible).  Nice try Amiga. An A for effort, but a C for execution.

Welcome to the exciting and competitive world of SURROUND. Your basic objective is to surround your opponent, causing him to run out of space in which to move, and at the same time not running into anything yourself. You can set up a blockade, force him into a corner or wander off by yourself and hope that he runs into something on his own.

Along with the basic SURROUND game, we've added four game features to make things more interesting. Be sure to read Section 4 to learn more about these features.

Then there's VIDEO GRAFFITI. It's just for fun without the competitive edge thrown in. VIDEO GRAFFITI actually allows you to draw on the screen. Again, read Section 4 to find out more.

The Object: 

Meet the challenges of a devastating shipwreck and a desolate wilderness island; then explore the mysteries within the secret temple.

The Situation: 

While sailing across uncharted waters in the South Pacific searching for the ruins of a lost civilization, a sudden storm ravishes your vessel. As your ship sinks, you struggle to keep afloat, knowing that your only chance is to reach the island that looms in the distance. A raft from the ship floats nearby. Swimming with grave determination through shark infested waters, you reach the raft and manage to clamber aboard. Now you stand a chance.

Food and water are your next concerns. Without an adequate supply, you will surely perish. Occasional debris from the ship floats by as you slowly drift toward your destination. Containers of food and water appear. If you could only collect them before you reach the island, you would be able to live on them while you explore the island.

Follow your onboard computerized map through a Survival Run. Conserve and restore your energy level and score points as you defend yourself against alien guards and their force fields. Your Cosmic Commander Control instantly responds to every move you make to deliver precision control and pinpoint firing accuracy. You're in total command of all the screen action as you take off on the ultimate space adventure.

~From the Manual

Both of the games that Milton Bradley released on the Atari 2600 came with special controllers. Spitfire Attack came with the Flight Commander and Survival Run was shipped with the Cosmic Commander. Both controllers are functionally equivalent to a joystick, so you do not need them to play the games today. Also, both games shipped with a sheet of stickers to be applied to the controller, as well as an end label to be attached to the cart. This is why it is common to find Survival Run and Spitfire Attack without an end label.

    <desc>
Sweat! was to be Starpath's version of Activision's Decathlon for the Supercharger.  Given the fact that the Supercharger allowed for more memory and larger games, Sweat! probably would have been an amazing game had it been completed.  Of course this never happened as the video game market was crumbling rapidly and people weren't spending money on regular video games, much less games that required special hardware.  It was around this time that the financially troubled Starpath merged with Epyx.  Most of Starpath's programmers transferred over to Epyx and used Sweat!'s game concept to create Summer Games.

Although Sweat! is the basis for Summer Games, little if any code from Sweat! was used.  According to Sweat! programmer Scott Nelson:

"Actually, there's probably more of Party Mix in Summer Games than Sweat!.  Sweat! never got much beyond the concept stage."

There are three known prototypes for Sweat, each at a different stage of completion.  The original prototype consisted only of the running events (Hurdles, 100 Meters, and 400 Meters), this version is the most widely known of the three prototypes.  Some time later, a second prototype was discovered which only consisted of the Shot Put event and didn't contain the event selection menus from the first prototype.  This has lead some people to speculate that this prototype was actually just a separate load that was meant to be called from the original prototype (although this currently doesn't happen).  Recently a third prototype was discovered that appears to not only have a title screen, but a more complete event selection menu.  Unfortunately this prototype doesn't appear to have any playable events, as it makes calls to loads that don't exist.

SWOOPS! is a collection of three 1K minigames that Thomas Jentzsch (author of Thrust+ Platinum) submitted in the 2004 Minigame Competition. Two of the games in this collection won first and second place in the 1K competition: Cave 1K won the category, and Splatform came in second place. All three of these games offer addicting gameplay that will keep you coming back for me! SWOOPS! contains a menu that allows you to select which game to play, as well as a "3-Athlon" mode that allows you to play all three games in succession.

The games are:

 - Cave 1K - Can you navigate a helicopter through a treacherous cave at a nail-biting pace, avoiding obstacles in your path as well as well as the floor and ceiling? As you progress through the cave, the obstacles get closer together and your speed increases! How far into the cave can you get?

 - Splatform 2600 - Splatform is a simple, but fun platform jumping game where your goal is to jump from platform to platform while moving to the right as quickly as you can. You lose points for bouncing in place, giving you an incentive to keep moving!

 - Crash 'n' Dive - Help little Toto to survive while falling down an endless tunnel. Score points by collecting sequences of identical colored platforms and bonus platforms and avoid deadly platforms. Starts slow, but gets extremly fast later. If you can survive that long! 

SWOOPS! may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.

WARNING: All you who enter EarthWorld will encounter danger, trials, tests, and obstacles. All will have an equal chance to decipher the hidden message.

Welcome to EarthWorld. This is the first in a series of four world that you must pass through on your quest for the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery.

As you explore EarthWorld, you will traverse 12 rooms, each named after a sign of the zodiac. You will encounter danger such as the horns of a charging Taurus bull, and you will be called upon to demonstrate your skill and ingenuity.

A variety of magical objects will assist you in the challenging journey ahead. These are strewn about the various zodiac chambers. Carrying certain objects along with you helps with game play. For example, the lamp allows you to see the charging horns in the dark bull pit of Taurus. By leaving the right combination of objects in the right zodiac chamber, you'll discover illuminating clues. These clues may:

1. Refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the EarthWorld puzzle.

2. Refer to the next world in the SWORDQUEST series, FireWorld. 

3. Help you solve the final puzzle of all four SWORDQUEST cartridges combined.

Be off with you! EarthWorld awaits your careful exploration.

You enter FireWorld as a mighty warrior.  Your skill and courage will be tested with dangerous trials and obstacles.  The object of the game is to solve the puzzle.

The FireWorld puzzle is based on the Tree of Life, with ten rooms linked together by ten rooms with doorways.  FireWorld has ten treasure chest rooms, some containing different magical objects.  These objects will help you on your journey through FireWorld.  Carrying particular objects will help you find clues.  Before you can explore these rooms, you'll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book.  As a warrior, your skills are important to conquering FireWorld.  To help you on your quest, you will be armed with the FireWorld comic book which contains additional clues.  Some clues will come from a combination of both the comic book and the Game Program cartridge.  These clues will refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the FireWorld puzzle.

You have just leaped into the blazing flames of FireWorld - see if you can survive and triumph!

WATERWORLD is the third in a series of four individual contests comprising the ATARI SWORDQUEST CHALLENGE.

The ultimate objective in the WATERWORLD contest is the jewelled Crown, made at a cost of $25,000.  To win that Crown, you will have to pass certain tests of dexterity and cleverness - in both the video game and the accompanying comic book.

Your goal in the WATERWORLD game cartridge is to discover the seven "numerical clues" that will refer you to the appropriate page and frame number of the accompanying comic book.  There you must look artfully for "word clues" to send to ATARI on the enclosed SWORDQUEST CHALLENGE entry form.

Not all the numerical clues are valid.  Three are decoys.  A careful poetic reading of the comic book is required in order to obtain information that will be helpful in selecting the valid word-clue answers from the false ones.

~From the Manual

The most rare of the three released Swordquest games, Waterworld is very sought after by collectors. It was originally only available via mail order from the Atari Club, but was later sold in stores in limited quantities. Programmer Tod Frye never finished the fourth and final game in the Swordquest series, Airworld.

Sync is a unique collection of puzzle and rhythm games that require you to think fast and improve your dexterity to get higher scores! Sync includes seven games in total and you're sure to find several (if not all!) to your liking! Many of the games have a wide variety of settings for you to try to keep them interesting--you'll never get bored of all the variety Sync has to offer! A brief description of each game follows:

Mantra

The world of Mantra is a matrix, progressively populated by sequences of symbols: keep matching each symbol by reacting with the corresponding action on the joystick, until a sequence is over, and you will score points. Can you keep the Mantra alive?

Jitter (4K)

The matrix from Mantra returns, but this time the symbols closely resemble arrows, and you are in control of the pace of the game: as soon as you match a symbol, the control will skip to the next one in the sequence. Maintain a steady rhythm of play to score bonus points!

Flow (4K)

Flow is a game of balance, played inside a grid, where you have to place bars around those placed by the CPU. As soon as a running cell counter completes a given number of loops across the grid, every CPU cell whose number of bars corresponds to the sum of adjacent bars placed by the player is removed, and points are scored. Watch out for side reactions, as placing your bars to balance a CPU cell can cause a mismatch on a previously balanced CPU cell!

Four

Four is a compilation of four minigames: both Jitter 1K and Flow 1K are scaled down versions of the corresponding 4K games; in Gate you have to match the symbols placed by the CPU on a column that rotates vertically; and Here requires you to clear cells whenever an arrow is inside each cell. All four of these minigames offer different challenges.

The above brief descriptions do not do these games justice! All of the included games have more depth than described above and will take a while to master--you'll find yourself coming back to them time and time again! Two of the games support one or two players (Mantra and Jitter 4K) while the other games are one-player only.

You are a frenzied bartender trying to keep the never ending flow of thirsty customers well watered.  You'll have to keep slinging sodas and occasionally guess which cans of soda the Soda Bandit has shaken.

As if that's not enough work for one bartender, try covering four different bars with a different crazy crowd in each bar.  There's the Old West Saloon, the Jock Bar, the Punk Rock Bar, and the Space Bar.

Keep the sodas coming, but not too fast.  You'd better be sure you've got a customer without a drink at the bar or the drink will slide right off the bar and no self-respecting bartender throws drinks away.  Keep your eyes open for the empties the customers sling back your way.

Port of the of the obscure Exidy coin-op of the same name, Targ is a simple yet strangely addictive action game that never saw a home port.  Originally planned as a CBS release, Targ fairly far along in the development process but shelved due to the crumbling video game market.  Targ was eventually picked up, finished, and released by Telegames as Universal Chaos.  However due to licensing issues, the graphics and name had to be changed.

Targ's gameplay is simple, you must maneuver you ship (the Wummel) through the Crystal City and destroy all the enemy ships before they ram into you.  Sound easy?  Well there's a little catch, the Wummel is constantly moving forward through the maze at breakneck speeds!  It takes several seconds to slow down and turn the Wummel around, making it a risk proposition. This makes a relatively simple game much more challenging (and exciting).  The further you progress into the game, the faster the Wummel and the Ram ships will move.

Due to the limitations of the 2600, the 9x9 maze from the original coin-op has been reduced to 5x9.  This actually makes the game much harder as there is less maze to hide in.  Another change to this version is that the Spector Smuggler is absent.  In the arcade version every now and then one of the squares in the maze will open up and a new ship called the Spector Smuggler will appear.  The Spector acts just like the Ram ships, but shooting it is worth big bonus points which increase with each level.  The Spector is present in the later Telegames version and in Universal Chaos, so one has to wonder if this omission is due to the CBS version being incomplete.

Targ is actually very similar to the Sierra computer game Crossfire, but I guess no one noticed as no copyright suits were ever filed. Targ's sequel, Spectar, was promised for release on the Colecovision, but this version too never saw the light of day.  While it's not exactly a sleeper hit, Targ is still a great game that deserved a better fate.  Just one question; exactly what is a Targ?

Task Force

Terrorists are at it again, and you command anelite anti-terrorist Task Force.  Negotiations have failed, so it's up to you to "take out" the terrorists.  They're holding several highrise buildings, and your Task Force is in position outside.  You have wire-guided missiles to fire any time a terrorist steps into view in a window.  You must fire quickly, because the terrorists never miss you when they have time to get off a shot.  And the terrorist leader on the roof has a neutron bomb that ends it for everybody if he lets it go.  But look before you fire!  The terrorists sometimes push hostages into view...don't shoot if the guy in the window doesn't have a gun. And plan ahead!  You have to wait for new supplies after firing all of your wire-guided missiles. 

Take out the 9 terrorists in the first building, then your Task Force heads out to the next hot spot (held by 12 terrorists), and the next (held by 15 terrorists).  Your fourth anti-terrorist operation is a treacherous night raid...and the action only gets hotter after that!

The goal of the player is to become a millionaire, after taxes, in one year.  As in real life, there are obstructions to your progress, bureaucratic levels to go through and obstacles to overcome such as governmental red tape, bad investments that lose money, taxes and IRS audits.

~From the Manual

An actual IRS employee wrote this game. Interestingly, your goal is to avoid paying taxes, and the IRS agent is the bad guy. It shares game-play mechanics with 20th Century Fox's "Porky's", although we're not sure who borrowed from whom.

Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller.  The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. 

Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked off to the first screen.

On the list of games that should never have been tried on the 2600, Tempest has to be near the top.  Why Atari decided they could reproduce a 3D vector game on the 2600 is beyond me, but the results were disastrous.  Thankfully Atari killed off this experiment gone wrong before it could hurt anybody.

I've said it once and I'll say it again; If there's one thing the 2600 doesn't do it's diagonals.  Unfortunately Tempest is chockfull of diagonals as the tubes angle out from the center of the screen to form complex geometric patterns.  This leads us to the next problem, if there's a second thing the 2600 doesn't do it's complex geometric patterns!  The 2600 version gets around this by not having 3D tubes, but rather a flat looking shape with the enemies coming from one side and the player moving on the other.  For some reason the "shape" seems to flux and change a bit as things move around the screen, this is probably the result of a programming glitch.  The "shape" is segmented into what could be called tubes (if you use your imagination), but these "tubes" don't seem to correspond to where the real tubes (which are invisible) are. 

This brings us to the next problem, if there's a third thing the 2600 doesn't do it's 3D perspective.  Atari couldn't get around this one; the 3D perspective is what makes Tempest "Tempest".  Atari tried to simulate this by changing the enemy's size to make it look like it was getting closer.  Unfortunately there aren't nearly enough frames of animation to do this, so the enemies sort of jump forward in an awkward fashion.  The enemy graphics are very blocky and becomes even more evident as the size is increased when they approach the outer edge of the tube.  This combined with a very blocky looking "shape" for the board makes for one nasty looking game.

In the programmers defense, they did a wonderful job on Tempest considering they were asked to do the impossible.  Since this version isn't complete, it's really not fair to start judging it yet.  Given some time, I'm sure a much more playable version with improved graphics and smother gameplay could have been put together.  While it probably wouldn't have ever looked like its arcade counterpart, this prototype proves that Tempest could (in a very limited fashion) be done on the 2600.  A later version with some added features like a title screen was reviewed in Ultimate Gamer magazine, but it's unknown what happened to that prototype.

~From the Manual

If only all sports games were this simple yet fun to play! Like Activision's other sports entries Ice Hockey and Boxing, Tennis is as exciting as a sports game can get on the 2600, especially when played against a buddy rather than the computer. The intuitive gameplay allows you to hit the ball at many angles, depending on where on your racket you hit the ball. The game is scored just like real tennis, meaning a set between two good players can be extremely competitive and last quite a while if the score is continually tied up at "deuce." Like many Activision titles, Tennis plays at a fevered pace. Hey, it may not be Wimbledon, but it's still a quick fix for tennis fans! (Contributed by Lord Helmet)

The full title for this game is "Terrance &amp; Phillip: Not Without My Anus", but I bet most people will call this Terrance &amp; Phillip 2, or, to make it even shorter, T&amp;P2. And I've begun work on it. There's a thread about this game in the batari Basic forum, where you can download the very first binary. Level 1 is swimming, a type of level I didn't get to do in the first game because I couldn't figure out how. Only problem is: The Terrance swimming sprite looks horrible. Maybe you can design a better one and let me know? In case you don't know, Terrance and Phillip are characters from the popular American animated TV show "South Park," which airs on Comedy Central. There is a movie that was made in 1999 which revolves around them.

This game is very difficult to find because many retailers declined to carry it. Others kept the game behind the counter away from children. Wizard Video faced protests when they released this game, as some social groups claimed that it promoted violence. It's very hard to find with the box and manual.

XYPE programmers Thomas Jentzsch and Paul Slocum have joined forces up to create Thrust+ Platinum, an updated version of Thomas Jentzsch's Atari 2600 port of the Commodore 64 classic, which itself took cues from the Atari coin-op game Gravitar. Thrust+ Platinum is now enhanced with a great title theme (listen to it here) composed by Paul Slocum, as well as several other audio enhancements. These audio enhancements add further polish to what was already one of the finest homebrew games on the 2600. Additionally, a new label and manual have been designed by David Exton, who has been the creative force behind artwork gracing many popular homebrew games.

Thrust+ Platinum is the latest iteration of Thomas Jentzsch's popular Atari 2600 conversion of the Commodore 64 game Thrust. Fans of Gravitar will feel right at home in Thrust+ Platinum, and this is a sophisticated and challenging game for the 2600. Thrust+ Platinum also supports a wide range of controllers, including joysticks, driving controllers, CBS Booster Grip, and a 2600-compatible foot pedal controller.

Thrust+ Platinum can be purchased complete with a professionally printed box, manual, cartridge from the AtariAge Store.

    <name>Thwocker</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>

    <desc>
Thwocker was one of the long lost Activision prototypes that finally surfaced in 2001 when it was found a thrift shop along with some other prototypes.  Like most other unreleased Activision games, Thwocker was never mentioned in any catalogs or announced at any gaming expos.  Apparently Activision liked to keep their games secret until they were sure it was going to be released.  Not a bad policy.

Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor fame), Thwocker was described as "Joust with musical instruments".  While this isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the maze to start the song.

Once the song starts to play your character will be able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the exit square.

The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire button, which will make the conductor sort of "skip" across the level.  You will need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the level.

Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow "combine" the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable after all. 

Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in between 9 and 10.  

Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.

These game numbers are represented by a space, another space, a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16 games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be 16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the conclusion that they were indeed planned.

Trivia:

Designed by Dan Kitchen, many of the 2600 versions of this title are actually for the 7800. You can tell the difference by looking at the circuit board (the wider version is for the 7800). Both versions will play in the 7800, but the mislabeled version will not work on the 2600 like it indicates.

In a situation similar to Chase the Chuckwagon, this game was only available via mail order from Johnson and Johnson. Although it is more rare than Chase the Chuckwagon, it does not receive as much attention. We're not sure why, but we guess it's because the name isn't as cool, and a dog food company producing a game is more interesting. This game is very sought after by collectors. There is no box for this game, just a cheap foam casing.

For the fourth year in a row, AtariAge created an annual holiday cartridge as part of our annual holiday sale. The cartridge for 2006, Toyshop Trouble, was a collaboration between several homebrew authors and artists, including John Payson, Zach Matley, Bob Montgomery, Nathan Strum, Dave Exton, Fred Quimby, Thomas Jentzsch, and others. Toyshop Trouble features in-game artwork by Nathan Strum (who has contributed to several homebrew projects), and includes a beautifully illustrated label and manual by Dave Exton, whose brush graces many homebrew games in our store. Additionally, each cartridge was individually numbered. The only way to acquire one of these cartridges was through the promotion during our 2006 holiday sale.

~From the Manual

One of the best coin-op conversions available for the Atari 2600, this one must be played with the Track and Field controller for the best experience (it is compatible with a standard joystick however). It was sold in an oversized box that included the controller, although the controller was also sold separately for use with other systems such as the Commodore 64 and various Atari computers.

~From the Manual

Trick Shot was released alongside Demon Attack and Star Voyager as Imagic's first three titles. Trick Shot is the only pool simulation available in the 2600's library, but it does its job quite well. However, the Atari 2600's limitations do come into play in that Trick Shot only displays three balls in addition to the cue ball on screen at once. There are three different types of games available: Trickshot, Pool, and English Billiards. Trick Shot was programmed by Dennis Koble, who went on to write Atlantis, Solar Storm, and Shootin' Gallery. (Contributed by sdamon)

OBJECT OF THE GAME

The object of Tunnel Runner is to successfully escape from an endless series of colorful, complex, three-dimensional mazes called Runs. To do this you must first find the key hidden in each Run. While in a Run, points are scored for every new Room you enter. Bonus points are awarded based on how long it takes you to escape from each Run.

Probably the hardest CBS game to find, especially with the box. This is a 3D maze game that also featured "RAM Plus" that was introduced with Mountain King.

SCSIcide is an original, fast-paced homebrew game released back in 2001 by Joe Grand of Pixels Past. In SCSIcide you play the role of a hard drive read head. As the different colored bits scroll by on the hard drive platter, you need to quickly read them in the correct order before you suffer a buffer underflow. As you complete each level, the data scrolls by more and more quickly! How far can you go? If you're a fan of Activision's Kaboom!, then you'll love SCSIcide.

Joe Grand has spent some time recently updating SCSIcide and has released a new version of the game titled Ultra SCSIcide. This latest version of the game contains many improvements over the original:

 - Added support for joystick controllers. Controller type is automatically detected when you press the paddle or joystick fire button to start the game.
 - Fixed the flicker that used to occur at the beginning of each level.
 - Changed background and data bit color palette to make bits easier to distinguish.
 - Reduced track size from 10 to 8 bits, for a more appropriate one byte per level.
 - Changed speed increase per level - only two random data bits increase in speed each level.
 - Modified the sound and scoring routines to account for longer gameplay and higher levels.
 - Changed title screen text and added GIS and Pixels Past logos.
 - Added a PAL version of the game. 

If you'd like to more about SCSIcide's original development, be sure to visit Joe Grand's SCSIcide Development Log (you might want to read from the bottom up).

To help commemorate this new version of the game, Joe Grand and AtariAge teamed up to create a new label and manual for Ultra SCSIcide. To that end we held an Ultra SCSIcide Label Design Contest to create original label artwork that graces all copies of Ultra SCSIcide that are sold through the AtariAge Store.

This title is actually a port of Sega's Targ arcade game. CBS Electronics originally planned to release an official home version of Targ for the 2600, but it was never published. Could this be the same game, and perhaps Telegames somehow acquired the code as they did for Sunrise's Glacier Patrol? Unfortunately, Telegames no longer has records of any kind for this title. If anyone has any more information about the origin or programmer of this game, please contact us.

    <desc>
Found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko, the identity of this mysterious Activision prototype has eluded collectors for years.  This prototype plays like a cross between a Rubik's Cube and the old sliding puzzle game.  The goal of the game is to line up all the colors in each row from light to dark.  If you've done it correctly the board should look like the start-up screen with the colors descending from red to purple.  However lining up all the colors is easier said than done due to the unique way the squares move across the board.  When you move your square up or down a row or column, the last square in that row will move behind your square's new position.  For instance if my square is the light green one (center of the row), and I move it left it will result in the last square in the row (the light blue one) moving behind it.  If I moved right instead, the last square on the right (the dark blue one) would move behind my square.  Mastering how the squares move is essential to solving the puzzle. 

If you forget what order the squares should go in, pressing the fire button will cause all the squares in the correct positions to turn black.  While this is helpful for positioning the shades of color in each row, it won't help you remember what color is supposed to go in each row.

Strangely both joysticks seem to function in this prototype even though it's one player only.  My best guess is that a second player feature was planned, so both joysticks were made to move the tiles temporarily until it was implemented.  The difficulty switches and the Color/B&amp;W switch have no effect in this prototype.  Even though there are four different game variations present, only two seem to be complete and playable.

While this prototype looks above average for a 2600 game, the gameplay just isn't up to Activision standards.  This puzzle game is boring, overly difficult, and in the end absolutely no fun to play.  I can only hope this prototype was a concept demo missing some major gameplay elements, as I can't see this game being ready for release.  Still if you're into puzzle games, this prototype will seriously challenge your mind (and your sanity).

Along with UAG#1 this mysterious prototype was found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko.  Since the label that once existed for this game has long since fallen off, we have no idea what the identity of this game might be.  However, this game appears to be much more playable than the other unknown Activision prototype.

This mysterious game plays somewhat like Atari's Save Mary.  However this time instead of building a tower by dropping bricks from the top of the screen, you must bump blocks from the bottom of the screen.  Before you start screaming about Activision copying Atari's idea, keep in mind that this game was programmed about seven years before Save Mary.  I'm sure the similarity of the concepts is just a coincidence. 

In this game you control a little Space Invader guy who must use the blocks at the bottom of the screen to build a tower and escape.  As the blocks come rolling down the conveyer belt, you must jump up and bump them so they land somewhere on the screen (the blocks don't count if they go off the edge of the screen).  The movement scheme in this prototype is a bit unusual as the longer you hold the joystick in a direction, the faster your little guy will run.  Although this is very realistic, it is a bit odd for a 2600 game and may take some time to get used to.  Once you have constructed a nice little tower, you must carefully jump on the conveyer belt and them climb the tower.  Be extra careful on the conveyer belt, as touching the blocks will cause your little guy to be flattened.  

Starting on the second level, you'll undoubtedly notice that some blocks will flash yellow or blue.  These colored blocks are actually part of an elaborate timing/bonus system.  The yellow block (which I call the Bump block) moves up the tower at the rate of once block a second, while the blue block (which I call the Bonus block) moves up the tower one block every time the yellow block reaches the top of the screen.  If your character happen to be on the tower when the yellow block touches him, you will be knocked down one level (slowing your decent up the tower).  However if your character touches the blue 'Bonus' block, you will gain bonus points as long as he remains on the block.  However greed can be a dangerous thing as the tower will collapse after a certain amount of time (determined by the difficulty level).  When the warning alarm sounds, you have exactly 10 seconds to hightail it up the tower or you'll be crushed under the debris. 

Starting on the third level, strange aliens creatures will begin to fly around the screen.  You can destroy them by hitting them with a flying block.  Smashing aliens is worth 180 points, while simply bumping a block will net you 5 points.  If you let the octopus alien reach the bottom of the screen he'll start breeding and clog the area.  However since you can simply knock the extra aliens out of the way so he's not a really big problem.  If you're really tricky you can use the blocks to fence in the alien and keep him form reaching the bottom, but this is more trouble than it's worth.  Starting on the fourth level a squat looking alien with two legs will rapidly move down the screen and try to catch your guy at the bottom of the screen.  When this happens you'll need to jump on the conveyer belt temporarily to escape until he disappears.  Unfortunately this alien is immune to the blocks so all you can do is avoid him.

Unlike most Activision games, this prototype has no game variations. However since this is still a WIP, game variations may have been planned later on.  The left difficulty switch controls the game difficulty (A=Easy, B=Hard), while the right switch appears to control how your character climbs the blocks.  When the right difficulty switch is in the 'B' position you cannot touch the center of the tower, as doing so will result in a block smashing your character.  Instead you must build the tower in a staircase-like fashion and climb up the edges of the blocks.  Naturally this is much more difficult to set up than a simple tower of blocks, so this variation is recommended for experts only.  When the right switch is in the 'A' position, your character can climb up the center of the blocks making things much easier.  Although this prototype appears to be nearly complete, there are still a few bugs in the game.  

Glitches include such things as your character getting stuck in the walls, and the screen becoming unstable when being bumped by the yellow block or when avoiding the leg alien. If you manage to score 100,000 points the score counter will reset to zero and you will be rewarded with an extra life.

The graphics and sounds for this title are top notch; it's obvious that a lot of work went into this game.  Everything from the smooth animation of your character to the cute "Can-Can" sequence at the start of the game screams quality.  So why was this game never released?  Unfortunately no one but the programmer knows the answer to this, but one possibility is that they may have left Activision before the game was completed.  Unlike Thwocker and Kabobber, we can't even put a name to this prototype, which makes it almost impossible to research its history or even figure out who the programmer was.  The EPROM is labeled MM NTSC D#3, which doesn't match up with any of Activision's known works in progress.  It is unknown what MM stands for, but it may have been a temporary code name used until a real title was decided on.

Special thanks to Mitch and bjk7382 for figuring out how to play the game in the 'A' position.

Most probably the rarest non-prototype Atari 2600 game known to exist. 

The Unknown Game

Try to reach the symbols at the top of the screen before you run out of energy by walking an invisible path on a randomly generated grid while avoiding UFO's and rocks dropped by birds.
You can choose a new path at the bottom of the screen.

Reaching a Minus:
You loose 300 points.
Return to the beginning of your chosen path to get new energy.

Reaching a Plus:
You gain 1000 points.
Return to the beginning of your chosen path to get new energy.
The flashing UFO's can be destroyed (500 points) by touching them.

Reaching a Sword:
You gain 500 points.
The grid becomes invisible and all paths are walkable now.
Return to the bottom of the screen to get new energy.
The flashing UFO's can be destroyed (500 points) by touching them.

When you get hit by a non-flashing UFO, you will loose 1 life.
When you run out of energy, you will loose 1 life.
Sometimes the paths change position and you will fall off and loose 1 life.
Sometimes you can teleport from one vertical path to another.

The game has a 2 player mode and 8 difficulty levels (the speed increases).

Believe me when I say that this prototype is a complete mystery.  No programmer, no model number, and no company.  We don't even know the name of the game.  The only we have as to the identity of this prototype is the name Universal, which is silk screened onto the EPROM board.  Unfortunately this just raises more questions than it answers.  Universal was an arcade game manufacturer, and licensed all its games to Coleco.  But why would Universal suddenly start programming their own original games for the 2600?

While we may never know the true identity of this game, it's a sure fire bet that it was meant to be a clone of Activision's Dragster (which is really a clone of Atari's Drag Race).  However unlike Dragster or Drag Race which are viewed from the side, this game is viewed from behind.  The perspective is similar to that of Activision's Enduro, right down to the vanishing point on the horizon.   It's immediately obvious from the graphics that alot of work was being put into this game.

As previously mentioned, this game is really just a clone of Dragster.  The player must rev his engine and change gears as fast as possible without blowing the engine.  However unlike Dragster the player actually has control over his car and can steer it around the lane.  The faster the player goes, the further the car will move into the horizon and the harder it is to keep from crashing into the sides of the lane.  Careful steering is a must if you're going to win a race in this game.

The controls in this prototype are a bit screwy, and can easily frustrate someone who isn't familiar with them.  Starting the race is particularly annoying, as the player must press left, up, and right until the little man drops the white flag (or the light turns green).  Once the race has started, pressing up will cause the car to accelerate, while pressing down will change gears.  When pressing down the gear indicator will briefly change from N (Neutral) to C indicating that you are changing gears, continuing to press down will cause the car to shift into gears 1 through 4.  

As you increase your speed the meter at the bottom of the screen will show your current engine temperature.  If you go too fast in a low gear, your engine will blow.  By shifting gears at the proper time you will enable your car to move faster without blowing the engine.  Once you've reached the finish line, you must press the fire button to launch your parachute and slow your car down.  If you do not launch your parachute in time your car will crash.  Pressing the select button will enable the computer driver which takes over the first players spot (the car will turn yellow).  To race against the computer you will have to use the second players joystick.  There are three different computer components to race against, a yellow car, blue car, and finally a red car.  You will have to race the blue and yellow cars a few times in order to see the red car. 

There are two different racing variations available in this prototype, which can be selected by toggling the left difficulty switch. When the switch is in the A position the race takes place on a city street (which looks suspiciously like Sega's Turbo) with stock cars and a man with a white flag that starts the race.  When the switch is in the B position the race takes place out in the desert with dragsters and the race is started by an automatic light.  This is little difference between the two except the dragster variation moves faster than the stock car variation (the player must switch gears faster).  While it may appear that there is no one player option for the dragster variation, there actually is but you really have to work to get to it.  In order to get to the one player dragster race you must first beat all three opponents (yellow, blue, and red), and then you will start the next race in the desert. 

While it isn't the best game out there, this racing game show promise and it's mysterious nature simply adds to allure.  This prototype was auctioned off by Best Electronics in 2004, and released by Curt Vendel of the Atari History Museum on Atari Age for the classic gaming community to enjoy.  Expect more information on this prototype soon.

Your goal is to reach the City of Mystery at the end of the tunnel and destroy Gond.  In the tunnel zones, you maneuver around sharp rocks and barriers while battling weird flying objects.  The more enemy objects you destroy, the more points you earn.  If you make it to the City of Mystery and shoot Gond, you earn bonus points.  But watch out!  Gond could shoot you instead.  If you survive the City of Mystery, you continue the game in Tunnel 2.  In two-player games, the player with the highest score wins.

Venture II was created by Tim Snider as a sequel to the classic game Venture. Only 24 copies of Venture II were produced. The first four carts were part of a pre-production run so Tim could get the manufacturing process fine tuned. Those first four are marked with Greek letters on the label. Tim then created 20 numbered copies of Venture II which he made available privately at the 2001 Classic Gaming Expo. One copy of Venture II sold at the CGE2K1 auction and went for over $200. Tim created perhaps the most extravagant packaging seen for a self-published title at the time--the game was delivered in a hand-crafted, miniature treasure chest, which opened to reveal the cartridge (with numbered label) and a manual, surrounded by elegant, gold leaf paper.

If you'd like to purchase a copy of Venture II (sans the fancy treasure chest packaging), you can do so in the AtariAge Store. Included is a beautifully illustrated twelve page manual by Dale Crum.
 
What's New:

All new monsters appear in this version of the game, and the dungeon walls have also been changed to make the game more challenging.

TRAINER VERSION: INFINITE LIVES

Over the past few weeks, several professional treasure hunters have dissappeared while exploring a dungeon reputed to house the most priceless treasures in the world. The only known survivor has returned with stories of monsters who eliminate anyone who dares enter the dungeon's halls and complex labyrinth of chambers. But authorities are not taking such reports seriously. 

"We have no rational explanation for these dissappearances," one investigator reported. "All we know is that the brave soul who wants to claim those treasures had better be sharp. At this point, the only one I know who's clever enough for the job is Winky," he told a crowd of would-be hunters. "Our hero should be ready with bow and arrows. Whoever or whatever is guarding those treasures is determined that no one comes out of there alive."

As one of man's oldest war games, chess is believed to have originated in India between 350 to 400 AD.  The first written record of the game was in 700 AD.  There are many variations of chess played throughout the world.

~From the Manual

Atari never intended to create a Chess game for the Atari 2600 when the system was first introduced. But the original VCS box had a chess piece on it, and Atari was ultimately sued by someone in Florida due to the lack of an actual chess game on the system. Some time later Atari's engineers began working on a version of Chess for the 2600. 

Although Video Chess ended up shipping as a 4K game, earlier versions of the game were larger in size. This prompted Atari to invent bank-switching ROMs which would be used in later titles that needed more than 4K of address space.

TOUR A CUBE MASTER'S WORLD!

Welcome to the cubical world of Hubie the Cube Master.  Hubie can solve the ATARI VIDEO CUBE puzzle in seconds flat -- 33.7 seconds, to be exact.  That's fast, but then, he's had a lot of practice.  You see, puzzles are Hubie's specialty.

Hubie wasn't always a Cube Master -- in fact he used to live a pretty ordinary life.  Every morning he made his breakfast, fed his dog Ralph, and went to work.  He did have a peculiar habit, though.  Hubie loved everything that had to do with squares or angles.  For instance, he was always sure to eat three square meals a day -- waffles for breakfast, ravioli for lunch, and cube steaks for dinner.  Hubie slept in a perfectly square bed.  Every day he swam laps in a square swimming pool.  And each morning, as he walked to work, Hubie was sure to count the squares in the sidewalk beneath his feet.

People called Hubie a blockhead, but when they did, he always had an answer.  Looking them squarely in the eyes, Hubie would shout, "Squares are important!  Try playing checkers on a _round_ checkerboard.  Or try using ice _balls_ instead of ice _cubes_ in your drinks.  Can you imagine going to New York to visit Madison _Round_ Garden?  It's just not the same.  It wouldn't work!"  And with that, he would square his shoulders and walk off. 

Yes, Hubie certainly had a checkered past.  But that was before the big change in his life.  One day, while square dancing in his favorite restaurant (the one with the checkered tablecloths), someone gave Hubie a puzzle -- a cube puzzle.  He played it day and night, twisting  and turning it to move the colors to the proper sides.  Soon, he started to see cubes and squares everywhere -- on the walls of his house, inside Ralph's square water dish, and even in the mirror while brushing his teeth. 

Something very strange was happening to Hubie.  One morning, instead of being in his square bed, he found himself on a strange flat surface.  He saw immediately that everything around him was square -- he was in an entirely square world!  This transformation was a mystery, but Hubie didn't really care.  He was...Hubie the Cube Master! 

Hubie knew his mission in life was to teach cubists and future cubists the best ways to play the magical cube puzzle.  He promised himself that he would learn how to solve the magical cube faster than anyone else in the world.  He invites you to help him with his pledge -- can you solve the cube faster than Hubie?  Try it and see!

This title was originally released as Rubik's Cube, but the name was changed we assume for licensing reasons. Atari Video Cube is the easier version to find. It was initially available only to Atari Club members through the Atari Age magazine, but later appeared in stores.

When you are ready to start exercising, step on the Foot Craz Activity Pad GREEN dot. It starts the pace symbols moving around each track.

There are two tracks displayed on the screen. To start moving the jogger figure, jog alternately on the ORANGE and BLUE dots on the Foot Craz Activity Pad. The faster you jog, the fast the jogger figure moves around the track. Lap count, time and score are displayed on the bottom of the screen. Once around the track is equal to approximately thirty-five yards.

To add variety and greater challenge to JOGGER, you may at any time, switch the jogger figure to the lower, faster track by stepping on the RED dot of the Foot Craz Activity Pad, and back again to the upper, slower track by stepping on the YELLOW dot.

JOGGER is more effective at the slower pace. The length of time jogging is more beneficial to your fitness than moving at sprint speed.

Track laps are counted, giving JOGGER a competitive feature for increased family pleasure. After 2,000 points are accumulated, the pace symbol speed increases and challenges you to jog faster.

Five minutes into your run, a second pace symbol appears on each track, making JOGGER even more spirited among participants.

Bonus points may be earned by passing the pace symbol when it is GREEN. If you pass when it is RED, you loose a "life." JOGGER gives you three "lives" before the sequence needs to be repeated.

JOGGER is an excellent trainer for those who want to begin a jogging program, or trim off pounds.

The Foot Craz was sold with Video Jogger and Video Reflex, and is sort of a precursor to Nintendo's Power Pad. Intended to get lazy video game players off their rear's and engaging in physical activity, I'll bet most owner's reverted to the good old joystick after trying this device.

This rare game was only available to owners of Magicard, making it perhaps the rarest of all 2600 games. It was only available directly from CommaVid, who sent a letter to owners of Magicard with an offer to purchase Video Life. We believe fewer than 500 copies of Video Life were produced and there are probably many fewer still floating about today. Video Life is a version of the classic computer-based life simulator in which you create an organism and watch it grow.

Pong(R) is played much like tennis.  Using a Controller, each player rallys the ball by moving the paddles on the playfield.

Paddles move only vertically on the playfield.  When one player controls more than one paddle, all the paddles move together in unison.  If there are two players on one team, the second player's paddle will be striped.  Each team's paddles are color coordinated with the scores at the top of the playfield.  The right hand score refers to the right Controller player or team; the left number shows the left Controller player or team score.

A player or team scores one point when the opponent hits the ball out of bounds or misses a hit.  The first player or team to score 21 points wins the game.

The last player or team to score always serves the ball.  Serve by pressing the red Controller button after waiting at least one second after the point is made.  If there are two players on one team, either player can serve.  In Robot Pong, the computer always serves the ball to the player...who lost the point.

INTRODUCTION

How many of you out there have always longed to be a pinball wizard? It's a good bet that some of the places you had to go to play a game of pinball weren't the most comfortable for you. Well, relax. Since you were wise enough to invest in this ATARI (r) VIDEO PINBALL TM Game Program TM, you'll never have to worry about being at places with that kind of unsavoury atmosphere again.

VIDEO PINBALL has the challenge and the excitement of standard pinball games, and it doesn't have any idea what a quarter is. So not only are you spared the unpleasant task of stuffing quarters into hungry machines, you have the comfort and the well-being of your home. What more could a pinball enthusiast ask for? And as for you pinball wizards, don't think you can master this one lickety-split. It'll be a while before your wiz rating is restored and in full swing.

Just in case you're a pinball rookie, there's only one thing you need to know. You're going to love it. You may have stayed away from the more traditional places of pinball habitation in the past, but now you're going to see why so many other people have gone goofy with "pinball madness". As a matter of fact, you'll probably catch the fever yourself within about 20 minutes.

So take a deep breath, turn up the stereo, and jump right into VIDEO PINBALL. One more thing. Better get yourself a piggy bank for all those quarters you're going to save.

You are a farmer, named Billie Sue, trying to protect your crops.  One patch in particular is giving you trouble.  It's surrounded by ten holes from which wabbits [sic] dart into your field.  Scare off the pesky creatures by throwing wotten [sic] eggs at them (they're in abundance this year and worth much less than good country carrots).  The score on the left depicts the number of carrots the wabbits have snatched and deposited in their wabbit holes.  The current carrot count increases every time a wabbit gets back into his hole with one of your carrots.  Your score increases everytime you wallop a wabbit with a wotten egg.  It's an egg-citing experience.

You earn points for knocking out 'bricks' in the far wall.  How many points depends on the level of play and how many balls you've used since starting at that level.  As with any ball game, the most basic objective is to hit the ball with the racket.

Once long ago in a distant land lived a king named Frederick.  He took very good care of his subjects and pretty much let the kingdom run itself.  One day King Frederick and his wife, Queen Christina, decided to start a family. To their surprise, Queen Christina soon gave birth to quadruplets.  Four healthy sons, all at once.  The King and Queen were overwhelmed.

The years passed quickly and Frederick's sons(Dominick, Marcus, Felipe, and Restivo) grew to be strong young men.  But they were nothing like their kind and peaceful father.  They were just the opposite.  The four sons of King Frederick fought constantly over anything and everything.  Their fighting was so fierce that even the normally unconcerned Frederick became concerned. Left to his violent and competitive sons, his peaceful kingdom could very well be destroyed after he was gone, or perhaps even sooner.

The solution King Frederick decided upon was drastic, but he knew it had to be.  Dominick, Marcus, Felipe, and Restivo were banished from their homeland and sent far away to a forbidden land.  There they became warlords, dividing their newly acquired territory into four equal sectors, which incidentally, was the first and last thing they ever agreed upon.  They then took to building their own castles, after which the battling resumed and never ended.  They stopped catapulting fireballs and lightning balls at one another only long enough to rebuild their damaged and war torn castles.  After repairs were made, the fighting always began again with renewed ferocity.

So King Frederick's warlords have been battling for many centuries and now it's up to you to carry on their long-standing feud.  Dominick, Marcus,  Felipe, and Restivo have been locked inside this Game Program.(tm)  They've stored enough fireballs and lightning balls so that they'll never run out, and neither will you.  They can hardly wait to do battle.  So good luck, you're in for some fierce competition.

Warring Worms is like an advanced version of the classic Atari game Surround. While avoiding walls, each worm can shoot a cannon that will destroy a single block on the playing field, or kill the opposing worm. There are ten starting playfields, a single player and two player mode, and hostile environment games with a total of 80 game variations in all!

Warring Worms is the first release from Baroque Gaming. It may be purchased in cartridge form, complete with manual, from the AtariAge Store.

It's an old fashioned "High Noon" shoot out in the techno-Old West. There have been many hacks of Berzerk in the past, but few have looked as smooth as Westworld. The Playfield has been changed to resemble locations and objects from the Old West. The Automazeons have been "duded up" and your player is now a gun slinging cowboy. The colors have been altered to look a bit more rustic as well. A very nice new look for an old stand-by.
 
What's New:

Playfield and sprite graphics and colors have been changed to represent an "Old West" theme.

As you might have guessed with a name like Wings, this game is all about planes.  Wings an air combat simulation game similar to the Atari Lynx title War Birds.  Wings was originally intended to be a 4K game, but it was decided that trying to cram a complete flight simulator into a tiny 4K cartridge was too difficult.  Therefore Wings was shelved until the development of the RAM Plus chip (a 10.5K RAM chip) made it possible.  Wings was thought to exist as a prototype for many years, but wasn't discovered until late 2004.  It was originally assumed that Wings would use the Booster Grip controller for its complex controls, but when the prototype was finally found it was discovered that it supported not only the Booster Grip, but also a strange two joystick scheme instead (similar to the late Atari release Radar Lock).  

The Left Joystick

The Left Joystick is used to control your plane.  Pressing the fire button and pushing up will throttle up the engines, while pressing the fire button and pushing down will throttle down the engines.

The Right Joystick

The Right Joystick is used to access your weapons.  Your weapon systems are only enabled after clearing the runway or reaching an altitude of 60 Feet.  Pushing down will switch between machine guns and missiles, while pressing up will fire your weapons.  Guns are weak, but have unlimited ammunition.  Missiles on the other hand are very powerful, but you only get two.  Use them wisely.

Before diving into the gameplay, this would be a good time to discuss the the instrument panel as it is vital to your survival.  Your instrument panel contains four different gauges: Fuel, Power, Airspeed, and Altitude.  Each of these gauges uses a digital readout to display to keep your informed on how your plane is performing.  

- Fuel Gauge (FUEL) - Measures how much fuel you have remaining (duh!).  If your fuel drops below 1500 it will begin to beep and flash warning you that you are about run out of fuel and crash.

- Power Gauge (PWR) - Measures the current power of your engines.  More power means more speed, but it also eats up more fuel.

- Airspeed Gauge (ASPD) - Measures your current airspeed.  You must maintain an average airspeed of at least 1535 MPH or this gauge will begin to flash and beep.  If you exceed 8000 MPH your plane will fall apart.

Altitude Gauge (ALT) - Measures your current altitude.  You must maintain an altitude of at least 512 Feet or this gauge will begin to flash and beep.

Also appearing on your instrument panel are three displays:

- Radar (left) - Shows you where the enemy planes are.

- Artificial Horizon (middle) - This gauge shows you how level your plane is.

- Compass (right) - Shows the direction your plane is heading in.

After a rousing rendition of Flight of Valkyries (which can be toggled on/off with the left difficulty switch), you start the game on the runway (naturally).  To take off you must throttle up your engines and achieve an airspeed of at least 512 MPH.  Once you've reached 512 MPH you can begin to lift the nose up (push down) and go airborne.  The runway will change colors (from Blue -&gt; Gray -&gt; Red -&gt; Green/White) to help you tell how far away from the end you are.  Once you're in the air, things get a little more tricky.  You will need to maintain an average airspeed of at least 1535 MPH to remain airborne or your gauge will begin to flash and beep.  If your speed drops below 780 MPH you will begin to go into a nose-dive and eventually crash.  You will also need to keep an altitude of at least 512 Feet or the altitude gauge will begin to flash and beep warning you that you're too low to the ground.  

Keep in mind that the direction of your nose will change how the plane reacts.  If your nose is pointed upwards you will gain altitude, but will also lose speed.  Likewise if your nose is pointed downwards you will gain speed, but lose altitude.  Figuring out the proper positioning of your plane's nose is key to staying airborne.  If your plane is level you can keep the a constant speed and altitude by throttling the engines to around 500.  This will help keep everything under control while you're busy shooting down planes.

Once you're flying a bit you will undoubtedly notice that you are not alone.  Enemy planes and ground guns will begin to take pot shots at you shortly after take off.  At first you may only see their bullets flying at you (represented by a spinning square), but if you get close enough you'll actually see the enemy themselves.  Thankfully your plane is armed with the latest in air to air combat weaponry.  To shoot your guns at the enemy planes, get one in your crosshairs and press up on the second controller.  You can also shoot missiles at the planes (press down on the second controller to switch to missiles), but you only get two so use them wisely.  Missiles are much more powerful than your machine guns, but should only be used in emergencies.  You can tell when you have your missiles armed by the targeting box that replaces your normal crosshairs.

Wings isn't a bad game, but grows repetitive after while for those of us who don't absolutely love air combat games.  There just aren't enough enemies to keep the game interesting, as you can fly around for long periods of time without ever getting a blip on your radar.  Another issue is there there are no clouds in the sky nor objects on the ground to give you a sense of speed.  Apparently marketing wanted to add some clouds, but they never got implemented.  Wings is more complex than other 2600 air combat games like Air Raiders, but not so complex that it becomes a chore to keep your plane flying.  It appears that Stuart was able to strike the perfect balance between accurate flight sim and action oriented dog fighting.  Sadly CBS decided to pull the plug on Wings mere weeks before it was ready to be released when they closed down cartridge development on October 23rd 1983.  The decision was made so late that promotional material (hats and scarves) and even a commercial had been made.  

There are two different Wings prototypes known to exist.  The earlier version dated June 3rd is in NTSC format, but is missing the enemy planes making it pretty boring to play.  The later version dated October 10th has the enemy implemented, but is in PAL format (CBS may have been planing on making Wings a PAL only release towards the end).  Oddly enough Stuart doesn't remember working on a PAL version of Wings.  It is hoped that a later and more complete version of Wings (from 10/23) may possibly exist on 7-inch disk, expect more information on this soon.

Wing War is a rather unique game that was only available in Europe, even though it was announced for the US market and is the only Imagic title that was not released in the US. The gameplay is a little like the classic arcade game Joust, except it's a bit more complex and involves a lot of exploration. A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. 

Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies. Wing War is a very unique game, and a shame it was never released in the United States. (Contributed by Larcen Tyler)

WINTER GAMES is a series of seven exciting competitive events. Up to eight players can enter this international contest, each choosing a country for which to compete (no two players can choose the same nation to represent).

The object is to see your country come out on top. You'll compete in pure speed events like skating and in speed-and-control events like slalom, biathlon, bobsled and luge. You'll test your skill against competitors in distance and style events like ski jumping and hot dog skiing. You'll win by scoring the fastest time or by earning the most points. And the nation that wins the most events takes home the gold medal!

If there was ever an obscure prototype it's Wizard.  Wizard was supposedly the last of Atari's last 2K games, but went unreleased in favor of the new 4K games.  Since Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never assigned a part number, most people don't even know if its existence. 

Wizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor.  You control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy the swirling star shaped creature.  The board layout is a giant maze, which makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off.  Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it can't shoot through them.  Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot.  Once your wizard is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot.  You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot in the direction of the creature.  This makes it easy to run away but still take shots at the creature.

Your wizard starts out with zero damage (indicated by the right number), and will die if the damage counter reaches 99.  Each shot you take from the creature causes you two points of damage, touching the creature will also cause you two points of damage.  As you take more and more damage your wizard will weaken until he finally dies.  In your weakened state you will move slower and take longer to recharge. 

The creatures damage counter is on the left side of the screen.  Each time you shoot the creature it will take two points so damage and be stunned for a few seconds.  This is your chance to get away to a safe distance and hide as you recharge.  The creature is normally invisible unless it's shooting at you or it has taken a hit.  You can tell where the creature is by listening to the "heartbeat" in the background.  The closer the creature, the louder the sound.

If you manage to get the creature's damage counter up to 99, it will turn black and die.  Your victory is short lived however as a new and more deadly creature will replace the old one.  Each new creature starts with less damage than the previous one, and moves and shoots much faster.  Each time you kill the creature your kill counter (next to the creatures damage counter) will go up by one, and your damage counter will go down significantly.

Wizard has a unique two player feature where one player can control the wizard while the other player controls the creature.  Since the creature is normally invisible, the second player must move blindly about the maze until he comes in range of the wizard.  The second player's creature will automatically fire at the player making his job slighty easier.  This interesting twist on the normal two player variation shows some innovation not seen in many games. 

Hidden in a random part of the maze is a small glowing flame.  If the left difficulty switch is set to A then you Wizard has the added task of defending the flame.  If the creature touches the flame your wizard will slow down as his source of power has been captured.  On the easy setting the flame is invulnerable to the creature and doesn't have any affect on the game.

While Wizard may not look like much today, it's amazingly fun in short bursts.  Unfortunately by the time Wizard was ready to be released (1980), Atari was starting to make 4K games with better sounds and graphics than their 2K predecessors.  According to programmer Chris Crawford "It didn't fit well into the product line".  Wizard was simply too dated to be released as is, but probably could have been made into a decent 4K game had Atari wanted to take the time to retool it.  But as they say, time waits for no man.  Sadly Wizard was left in dust, destined only to become a footnote in prototype history.

Escape from Castle Wolfenstein again! But this time do it on your VCS! Its all there, nazis, dogs, guns, knives, chalices, med-packs, you'll never believe this was once Venture, a dungeon crawler about snakes and pots of gold!
 
What's New

 - All graphics changed for monsters, maps, items and rooms.
 - All sound FX altered. The single arrow sound FX was split into 2 for the knife and gun to sound different.
 - The scoring system was changed so you can score points in a room by killing monsters before picking up the item.
 - Touching a corpse no longer hurts the player.
 - The monster corpses are animated to fade away.
 - In the big rooms the monsters (now SS guards) patrol in predictable patterns rather than semi-randomly as the monsters in zoomed rooms still do.
 - The game ends after completing 8 levels of play, and shows a animated victory screen.
 - There is a title screen.
 - The movement pattern of the large hall monsters (SS guards entering a room) is changed so that given room to manuver the player may possibly get past the SS guard to the exit.
 - the moving wall room is altered so that the player MUST cross the path of at least 2 walls (or one wall twice) to complete the room. Plus random moving walls are speeded up in later levels.
 - For the first 2 levels all room layouts, monsters and items are the same every time you play. For the remaining 3 pairs of levels however, the room position, room mirroring/non-mirroring, monsters and monster starting positions are randomized. The 8 base rooms for each pair of levels are rotated randomly between the next two levels so the player will not know what a room looks like until they get in it. I believe there are 4 * 4 * 7 * 2 = 224 possible room/monster configurations.
 - The unlimited arrows weapon for the player is replaced by a gun long range but limited ammo, and a knife with short range but unlimited use.
 - The score display was altered. The 2 permanent trailing zeros were removed from the score display and recycled as an active weapon icon and ammo indicator bar.
 - The player starts with 4 extra lives not 3.
 - Some items do more than award points. The gun and ammo give the player the gun weapon. The player starts with only the knife. The medkit restores one life up to a maximum of 4 in reserve.
 - There is an additional hidden/secret level in the game. You will know if you find it. It is very different in appearance from all other levels in the game.
 - If you finish the entire game including the secret level, then you get to experience a slighty altered title screen in place of the victory screen.
 - Each level of the castle has its own wall color rather than recycling the pink and blue wall colors over and over.

Extremely rare Sancho prototype. Only one cartridge is known to exist.

The game seems to be unfinished, because it still has over 1K of free space left that could have been used for a valid 'word pool'.

This game was most probably originally made by Home Vision, because a Home Vision logo has been found inside this ROM.

WORD ZAPPER

Word Zapper is a one or two-player, full color, action game with 24 variations, designed to be played on the ATARI (R) Video Computer System (TM) or Sears Video Arcade.

The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper. It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.

Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen.

You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.

Sounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.

 - The 1st, 2nd, and last bases
 - The elevator, removed those lines going across it (The arcade didn't feature them)
 - The balls the Rollerbaby's roll up into
 - Some of the missiles on the walls
 - Most of the guns have been improved

Larry also added "Arcade" to the title and changed the dates to 2003, just to set it apart from the original 2600 version.

ALIEN ATTACK!

Hostile aliens--Xenophobes--are infesting space stations vital to your planet's security. These aliens threaten to overrun the stations, rendering the space stations useless.

You are part of an elite team which is ready to speed to these endangered space stations. Your mission is clear: destroy the aliens regain control of the space stations, and pick up any valuable hardware you might discover as you sweep the stations for aliens.

The aliens are a swarming band of uglies straight out of your worst nightmare. You'll need to use your talent just to stay alive as you rid each space station of these pests. You don't want to let them catch you. It's them or you. 

The message has come. It's up to you and your teammates to cleanse each space station of aliens. Your Mother Ship brings you to the vicinity of each overrun space station. You then enter the space station via a transfer disk, which beams you aboard. 

Another member of your elite squad can work stations too, and you may compete for high score, or work on your own to clear the aliens from an infested space station. Just be careful as you enter a space station. The aliens are everywhere!

It's dangerous, it's devious, it's Xevious.  Atari was planning on porting the popular arcade shooter Xevious to the 2600, despite the great difficulty involved.  But sadly like so many 2600 arcade conversions before it, Xevious was not be. Another victim of the management shake up at Atari. 

When Ray Kassar was fired as CEO of Atari in 1983, James Morgan was hired to take his place.  Jim put all projects on hold for 30 days while he reviewed what had been going on during Ray's "reign of terror".  Since the 7800 was deemed high priority, most 2600 and 5200 projects were put on hold or outsourced to GCC.  Promising arcade conversions such as Tempest, Sinistar, Elevator Action, and Xevious were scrapped in favor of the new 7800 system.  Although they didn't know it at the time, Atari was slowly driving the nails into its own coffin.

While it may not be complete, the 2600 version of Xevious is pretty impressive (especially for the 2600) and was turning into a great arcade conversion.  Programmer Tod Frye had somehow managed to implement a scrolling background as was seen in the arcade version.  While this background wasn't as detailed as it's arcade cousin, it was still a major accomplishment for the 2600.  Not only was Tod able to get the scrolling background implemented, but he was able to have multiple enemies appear on the screen at once with little or no flicker.  In fact the only thing that flickers in the entire game is your ship (more on that later).

While the gameplay in this early prototype is amazingly accurate, some corners still had to be cut.  One of the 2600's biggest problem was that it only had one fire button, making many arcade conversions difficult.  Tod got around this problem by having the fire button serve double duty as your fire and bomb button.  Pressing the fire will shoot a shot and drop a bomb that slowly arcs to where the targeting sight is.  Originally it was thought that the buildings were cut from this version (making tanks the only things you can bomb),  although after examination of the game code it now appears that the buildings are there, but the data for their positions on the map are missing.  Also missing from this version are the large variety of enemies and the super fortresses, but since this is a work in progress they may have been planned but just not implemented. 

While the gameplay may have been dead on, the graphics were a bit on the strange side.  The disc shaped enemies and mirrors looked right, but your ship and the tanks look like an exercise in modern art.  The strangest thing is that your ship is apparently made out of two gray bars that cross in the middle.  Why Tod decided to make your ship this way is unknown, but to get it to work right he had to make them flicker like mad.  This odd design also makes your ship almost twice as large as it was in the arcade (making it harder to dodge enemy shots).  Rounding out this graphical freak show are the tanks which just happen to look like limping lowercase n's as they hump their way across the ground.  I have no explanation for this other than Tod may have been fooling around with the graphics a bit (or maybe the rumors about the drug influence are true?) .  I can't believe they would actually be left like this in the final version.

Even though there is no Super Fortress to destroy, Xevious is still a pretty fun game.  For an early work in progress this version is very impressive and showed that Tod knew his stuff (so what happened with Pac-Man?).  Had it been finished Xevious probably would have been a mainstay in most 2600 libraries and a big hit for Atari.  While the 2600, 5200, and 400/800 versions may never have seen the light of day, Xevious was finally released for the 7800.  Well I guess one out of four ain't bad...

~From the Manual

This game has nothing to do with the similarly named Marvel comic book. Rather, it is a pornographic videogame, the only title made by this company. It faced protest from women's groups when it was released, and most retailers declined to carry it. It is consequently very hard to find today. It is easier to find in PAL format.

Here is what the programmer, Russell Babylon, had to say: "At present this is a one player game. The game follows standard Yahtzee rules. The only exception is that you can only score extra Yahtzees as a Yahtzee (some versions of the rules allow you to score extra Yahtzees as combinations less than a Yahtzee). The game control is very intuitive. You use the left joystick to play the game. From the title screen press the fire button to go to the game screen and roll the dice. The five dice are white in color which indicates they are all unselected. Pull the joystick down or move it right or left to highlight a die. The highlighted die will flash. Press the fire button to select the die. Move the joystick in any direction to move away from the die. Notice that the selected die will now be green in color. Repeat the above sequence to select all the dice you wish to keep. Now move the joystick up or down so that no dice are flashing and you have not highlighted any scoring options.

Press the fire button to roll the unselected dice. You may roll the dice a total of three times. After any roll you may score your dice combination by pulling down or up repeatedly on the joystick until you have highlighted the scoring option you wish to use. Press the fire button when the appropriate scoring option is highlighted and if your dice combination is correct you will get the appropriate score. There are no take backs so be careful with your scoring. I have been working on some AI algorithms to have the computer play a game of Yahtzee against you but these are in the early stages."

TRAINER VERSION: INVINCIBLE

The primary objective of the game is to break a path through the shield, and destroy the Qotile with a blast from the Zorlon Cannon.  The secondary objective is to score as many points as possible.

The shield is the red area in front of the Qotile base.  It appears in one of two shapes, as an arch, or a shifting rectangle.  The shield is made up of cells.  The Yar scout can destroy these cells by firing at them with energy missiles, from any location on the playfield, or by devouring them on direct contact.  (The Zorlon Cannon can also be used to destroy the cells, but this is a waste of a powerful weapon.)
