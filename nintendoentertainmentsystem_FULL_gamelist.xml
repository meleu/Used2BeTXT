    <desc>Have you ever been lying awake at night, thinking "wow, wouldn't it be cool if there was a board game RPG?" Well, the Ask Corporation has answered our prayers, dear boy! And as simple as a "board game RPG" might sound, 100 World Story truly defies explanation. Well, sort of. You roll dice and traverse the land, entering towns, passing through forests and killing small woodland animals, finding treasure, spending treasure, losing treasure, and enduring fetch quest after fetch quest to become strong enough to accomplish the scenario's main goal. There are two ways to win: Accomplish the main goal (there's three scenarios: slay the dragon, find the legendary treasure, and rescue the princess), or have the most points (gold, equipment, etc) after all the rounds are over. Random people will give you experience, you always tend to find items lying around on the road.. It's always completely random and fun.

Battles are pretty typical RPG stuff, you pick the option to fight, magic, etc. and the combat only lasts a turn before it's the next person's turn to play. It's great fun, so play the game.

Translation Description:

Midas has done a great job translating this, as I can only imagine there must be tons of text in this little game. The only problem (and it's kind of a big one) is that the translation won't work in a lot of emulators. Use NESticle for best results, even if it's an ancient pain in the ass.

Update 25 April 2007: Most of the bugs should have been fixed in the latest bs.vq version.

    <desc>
This is the first football game for the NES, and it is based on the arcade game "10 Yard Fight" by Irem. The rules are the same as a football game.

This being Nintendo's first attempt at a football game, I have to give them some props, but aside from that........

Directions:

This game was definitely not known for its plethora of options. The only real options you have are to choose one or two players. If you choose play one player mode (you vs. the computer), you start at high school level and work your way up through college and on to professional.

This game follows the standard American football rules. You try to get into the other player's end-zone while avoiding the mass of athletes trying to clobber you.

Each time you snap the ball you can either run with it or try for a pass. There really aren't plays to choose from. You kinda just decide what you are going to do and do it on the fly. You have four downs to move the ball at least ten yards, you can go for it on fourth down if you want to, but you better get it or it will be a turnover on downs. I suggest the safe way, punting or trying for a field goal on fourth down. 

Controls:

A Button: Tackle
B Button: Pass the ball
Start Button: Pause

Hints:

Pass the Ball!
Try passing more than running, you will get more yards out of each play.

1942 was one of Capcom's first big hits. While not as popular as some of Capcom's series that would debut later in the 1980s (like Street Fighter and Mega Man), 1942 became one of Capcom's hallmark games. The graphics looked very good compared to the arcade version. The colors were nice and bright and the backgrounds and sprites were drawn pretty good. The sounds were mediocre with a little more white noise than I would like. The controls are easy and responsive. The gameplay is action packed with a million things going on at once. The game can get very difficult at certain parts.

Directions:

The daring Super Ace must fight through 32 stages of dogfights to reach Tokyo and destroy all of Japan's aircraft. There will be an aircraft carrier at the end of each level that functions as a boss.

Shoot as many of the enemy planes as you can while avoiding being shot yourself.

You can use the Loop de loop and dodge enemy fire, but you only have 3! If you are hit by a bullet or enemy plane you will die. You start with three extra lives, after they're gone it's game over. Destroy a formation of Red Planes to get a POW to appear. This is a power up. Green gives you more bullets per shot, White gives you assistance from two other planes, White with red outline destroys all the planes on screen, Red gives you 1,000 points. In two player mode you will take turns fighting your way through the enemies. The person with the highest score wins.

Controls:

"A" Button: Loop de Loop
"B" Button: Shoot
"START" Button: Start/Pause
"Select" Button: Nothing

Hints:

Loop de Loop Conservation
Don't waste any Loop de Loops. Only use them when you absolutely have to, you have three per level and there is no way to get any more.

    <name>1943: The Battle Of Midway</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
1943 is a lot like 1942 but it has a few more features that make it a little cooler. It is still a lot of fun and very addictive. The graphics are very colorful and well rendered. The controls are easy to use and responsive enough to make the game interesting. The sound effects were pretty good for the limited means of the NES. The music gets a little annoying at times though. With action packed gameplay and close calls behind every turn, this game has a lot to offer.

Directions:

The game is set in the pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.

As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane.

Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. 

Energy is reduced by:

- Getting hit by enemy fire (minor loss)
- Getting rammed by enemy planes, the larger the plane the worse (major loss, often fatal)
- Time
- Grabbing a special weapon power-up
- Using special attacks (lightning, tsunami, cyclone)
- The game is over when all of the P-38's energy is gone. Special weapons replace the default twin gun, are obtained as powerups (see below) and last for a limited time before the shots revert to normal. They include:
- Shotgun (wide, clears enemy fire, a second shotgun powerup increases its power)
- Three-Way Machine Gun (wide, similar to the basic shot)
- Auto (fires an extended burst)
- Super Shell (the only weapon that fires continuously if the button remains pressed)
- Laser (rare, armor-piercing)

Special attacks include:

- Lightning (air sections only; destroys all small flying objects)
- Tsunami (surface battle sections only; destroys all small flying objects, damages ships and stops scrolling for a few seconds)
- Cyclone (clears all enemy fire)
- Using either the Lightning, Tsunami, and Cyclone will decrease the player's energy meter rapidly, but not to death (they will stop working instead).
- If the level ends with a surface attack, the ship targets will count towards the score; otherwise all air targets are accounted for. The player must succeed in destroying 70% of the boss or face a return to the scene to finish the job. Upon level's completion, most of the energy meter is replenished and points are awarded according to the percentage of destroyed targets and the number of loop moves remaining.

Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, the most common type of which is the POW icon, which will replenish a little of the energy meter. Optionally, the player can fire at the POW icon to turn it into a variety of weapon power-ups as described above. As the weapon power-up currently in effect wears out with time (one point per second), replacement power-ups need to be picked up on a regular basis, or weapons will revert to the stock guns. The last of the regular power-ups, the rare double canister, will replenish most of the energy gauge. Apart from chance encounters straight from a red squadron, it is acquired by firing at a regular power-up icon for a very long time - it finally turns into one.

Other rarer power-ups exist. Occasionally a red squadron will yield Capcom's famous "Yashichi" symbol, which will replenish the energy meter completely. A plane symbol will provide reinforcements in the form of two wingmen. Sometimes a small, green plane will enter from behind, destroying it will reveal a star-shaped score bonus. Every level also contains hidden bonus items that can be spotted by firing randomly. When bullets hit this invisible target, a bonus will appear. The most noteworthy of these is the curious cat-shaped statue, which will teleport randomly around the screen. Picking it up will enable the P-38 to use the laser weapon for roughly 65 seconds.

    <desc>This is the sequel to 3-D Worldrunner. Don't break out those glasses just yet, kids: this game requires special glasses in order to see the rad 3D effect.

As far as how it plays compared to the original, it's... well, it's pretty much the same game. Your speed is fixed (meaning, constant) here, so your only choices are basically to move left and right. And jump, goddammit, jump. You won't be able to avoid those damned spinning orbs of death on the ground by just running past them. Maybe at first, sure. But not forever!

Translation Description:

Not much at all needed translating, just the title screen and the ending.

    <desc>
3-D Worldrunner is one of the few platformers that scrolled forward instead of left to right. It definitely made for some interesting gameplay. This game came with a pair of 3-D glasses, and during the game you could hit select to enable 3-D mode. The only complaint I had while playing is the inability to stop running. While you can slow Worldrunner down, you can't make him stop.

The colors were very interesting, each planet had a different color scheme and background. The music was very upbeat and seemed to put me in a mood to hurry. Graphically, it was a pleasure to see, and all the sprites were well drawn and easily identifiable. This is definitely something Acclaim should be proud of. 

Directions:

Power-ups include a rocket that gives you the power to shoot enemies, a potion that gives you an extra hit point(which is double the one hit point you would normally have), a star that makes you invincible, and a poisonous mushroom that well, poisons you. OK, so maybe that last one was a power-down, but definitely worth a mention in its own right. If you get the rocket before you get the potion, when you get hit you not only lose your extra hit point, but you lose your rocket as well. This only happens sometimes, so I think it is a glitch.

Sometimes, when jumping over an exceptionally large pit, you will see little frog-looking springs. Be sure to land on these, because usually you won't be able to clear the pit without bouncing on them. Be sure to grab a balloon if you see one, it will take you to a bonus level. You will also need to master the art of jumping in order to make it any substantial distance in this game. You won't always have to jump as far as you can. Sometimes, there is a pit right after a medium sized pit, so you will have to time both of your jumps just right, so as to not fall in either of

As the jammin' skateboarder you know you are, you've got to test your skills in the toughest course any skateboarder has ever seen. You start off with a hundred bucks in your pocket, your trusty skateboard, and the awesome moves you've learned along the way. Find your way around the park while dodging kamikaze cars, looney thugs and killer bees. You've only got a short amount of time to work your way through each one of the four levels, or classes, of difficulty. Show off your hot moves, and rack up points to earn tickets to the parks. If you're lucky, you might find some loose bills lying around. Scoop 'em up. You know you'd like to get the dough to buy those cool duds and some of that hot equipment.

--From the NES 720 Degrees instruction manual.

Overview:

720 degrees is quite possibly the worst gave ever. Let me see, where should we start. OK, I have it: the controls are terrible. You have two buttons and they want you to pull off some Tony Hawk movez, I don't think so. Second, the skate park is full of water hazards and people that will hit you with frisbees or just plain beat you down. I know this sounds just like every other skate park, but for the game they could have made it less realistic. Last, but certainly not least, the lack of graphics and story line, you are just some random guy that happens to be in a skate park and wants to be abused. A word to the wise -- do not play 720 Degrees.

Directions:

Try to stay alive, and do as many tricks as you can. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Trick
Start Button: Pause/Confirm
Select Button: N/A

Hints:

Stay Alive
There is no escaping death, but you can try. If you manage to keep running from this skull, eventually it will morph into a hypodermic needle and go 10 times faster and eventually kill you. However, if you happen to be nearby an obstacle course entrance, by all means go inside, this is your ONLY possible chance of escaping this crazy death skull.

Gameplay: 2/10

The gameplay is incredibly slow to get started, and does not pick up at all once you get going. If you are not happy with the first time you played, do yourself a favour and do not even play on. One can only bet 1 credit at a time which is really pathetic for a slot machine. Increasing a bet means throwing additional credits into different rows and then in the end one can have five credits bet on each row. Why would I want to do that? The game should really give an option to give more slot control, higher credit betting and so on. The double up game is a sub-game within the slot machine. One would think it is there to increase your credits. Credits are free anyway by the way. Instead by winning five in a row of this mini game you are presented with a girl slowly losing clothes, who had the idea to make this part of a slot machine game?

Graphics: 3/10

Graphics are the best thing about this game by miles, but that is still very poor. The symbols look a little amateurish and the entire slot machine lacks features and the usual bells and whistles one would expect from the slots. The double up game leads to low-res pictures of women losing more and more pieces of clothing. I did not even expect this in the game, even with some of the other games Sachen have produced. And I do not see the point in having that bonus game included.

Sound: 1/10

Plain horrible. You will have to endure the wheels turning screeching each time you play. Way to turn this off? Not really, your TV remove is the best and highly recommended method. Think about it, would you want to play a slot game if the wheels would make a high-pitch noise all the time?! Surely not! The terrible sound effects even beat the graphics and gameplay to the worst-part-in-a-Sachen-game reward. With sound turned off, it can just about be bearable.

Overall: 1/10

If you enjoy punishing yourself with bad games, this is the one for you. Not quite on par with 'Honey Peach' but in a league on its own of annoying sound effects a game can feature. Five minutes into the game you will most likely regret having started it, however. Not recommended, AT ALL.

After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... and now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Duke's castles. There you will face the Duke's soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.

Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of all mankind!

--From the NES 8 Eyes instruction manual.

Directions:

In the one-player game of 8 Eyes, you control both Orin (the hero) and Cutrus (the bird). In a two-player game, Player 1 controls Orin and Player 2 controls Cutrus. 

Press Up + B to release or recall Cutrus, and Down + B while he's flying, to make him attack. Similar to Castlevania, you can also pick up special weapons with various powers, which you can use by pressing Up + A.

Each level you defeat gives you a new sword, but each boss is only vulnerable to one kind of sword, so you have to somehow find out which order to beat the levels in. According to the 8 Eyes Instruction Manual, 'The sword you start with is weak and only good for a country near France.' 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
Up + A Button: Use weapon
B Button: Use Sword
Start Button: Start Level, pause game

In the year 5012, a strange cytoplasmic creature is sighted in your galaxy. It's Parasitis! A deadly, formless mass which feeds on all life forms and assumes the shape of its swallowed prey! Parasitis rapidly advances upon your home planet, Abadox, and engulfs it!

From nearby space stations, the World Alive Force launches a full-scale attack. But the massive Parasitis crushes the entire squadron! An orbiting hospital ship is even swallowed whole - with the beautiful Princess Maria on board!

You are Second Lieutenant Nazal, the lone survivor of the Force. Sidelined from the action by your ship's faulty energy drive, you witness the attack! But it's not too late to join the battle!

Now your weapons are ready and your ship has been repaired! Jettison from your spacecraft, ignite your power pack and zoom into Parasitis' grisly surface. Your Mission: To blast your way inside Parasitis' nightmarish body and battle your way to its Core - to destroy it!

Fight your way inside its deadly mouth! Travel down its throat, through its nerve center - battling hordes of enemy antibodies and bacteria! Use lasers, guided missiles, and special orbiting shields to destroy them! Beware the Guardians that ward off all intruders - bombard them with fierce fire power! You must succeed to save the Universe and rescue Princess Maria!

--From the NES Abadox instruction manual.

Overview:

Parasitis, a planet-swallowing monster, has swallowed a hospital ship with the princess of Abadox aboard. You are Lieutenant Nazal. Your job is to fly inside Parasitis, rescue Princess Maria, and destroy parasitis from the inside.

Abadox is a side scrolling shooter where you're inside a giant alien. The game plays a lot like Life Force or Gradius in that it is a shooter with upgradeable weapons and speed. In Abadox, however, you are a spaceman rather than a man in a spaceship.

The graphics in this game had a surprising amount of detail for an 8-bit system. The alien's organs and veins look pretty real. Sometimes they even move. There seems to be a repeat of the same background music for a good many of the levels. The sound effects were good, though.

Directions:

Fly Lt. Nazal through the alien to save Princess Maria. Be sure to get at least one speed power-up, or you won't be fast enough to move out of the way of enemies and their fire. Some people prefer two, but don't get three. You will be too fast and hard to control. Grabbing power-ups is essential, because they add to your firepower. With three-way and five-way shots, laser beams, and circle beams, there are a lot of options for weapons. They also have power-ups that will protect you from enemies. It will start circling you as soon as you get it, and give you an extra hitpoint. Other than that, you only have one hitpoint.

Controls:

A Button: Adjust the radius of your protective shields
B Button: Fire weapon
Start Button: Pause game

Hints:

Invincibility
At the title screen press: A, A, Up, B, B, Down, A, B, Start. When you start the game, press pause to become invincible.

    <desc>
Look! He likes them! Likes them? The boy's Blob loves them! Jellybeans, that is. In every flavor under the subway. Like Vanilla. Apple. Tangerine. Cinnamon. Cola. Coconut. And more.

Like many boys in the twenty-first century, the boy has a buddy from outer space. This one's from Blobolonia - a place where an evil emperor makes everyone eat only marshmallows and chocolate. In fact, for the emperor, healthy things like vitamins are poisonous.

Blob (his full name is Blobert) came to Earth looking for someone to help him defeat the evil emperor. That's how he met the boy.

To defeat the evil emperor they boy and Blob will need a goodly supply of vitamins. And to get the vitamins, they'll need money. To get money, they'll search the underground caverns for hidden treasures and diamond stones.

So what's a boy to do? Just whistle! (That'll call Blob.) Then feed him jelly-beans.

You see, the boy miraculously discovered that not only does Blob love jelly-beans - but that different jellybeans turn Blob into different shapes. And that those shapes can be used to get through many otherwise impossible situations!

With his repertoire of shapes, Blob can help the boy overcome even the most outrageous obstacles - as long as Blob gets the right flavored bean. In fact, with enough jelly-beans in enough flavors, anything is possible.

--From the NES Boy and His Blob instruction manual.

Overview:

On the planet Blobolonia, the Blobs lived happily on a diet of jellybeans. One day an evil emperor took over and forced the Blobs to eat nothing but chocolate. The Blobs will die soon if they cannot eat jellybeans, so they send a blob to Earth to think of a plan. A boy takes him in as a pet, and now they must foil the evil emperor's plans.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! This game will melt your brain! It's like Myst in the way that you have one big puzzle to solve, but you've got limited jelly beans, so there isn't much room for error. You could get to the end of this game and not have what you need to complete it. Good idea, bad execution.

Directions:

Use the jelly beans to transform your Blob partner into tools to help you find treasure. Use this to buy vitamins, you'll need them to take care of the bad guys on their planet.

Controls:

A Button: Toss Jellybean
B Button: Whistle
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Brick Wall
- Normally the Blob won't eat Ketchup jelly beans. You can trick him by using one right after you use another kind, such as Honey, then use the Ketchup while he's transforming. The Ketchup bean will turn him into a brick wall.

    <desc>As usual I used cheats to do a playthrough and even then I'm not sure I enjoyed playing the game. I think this might be because of the level design. I thought the levels were too long and boring for me and man there were just a lot of levels too. Of course all I really did was fly through air trying to clear them as fast as possible. The American version had like half the levels of the Japanese version and I'm beginning to think that was a smart choice due to the amount of time it took me to beat the game. I'd say give it a try if you're interested to judge for yourself.

Translation Description:

This is a complete translation patch for Fudou Myouou Den for the NES. This game is the Japanese version of Demon Sword, which contains lots more stages, weapons and magic. Plus there's a cool Buddhist intro/outro. Thanks to snark for translating the Siddham and FlashpV for doing some graphic work.

Action 52 is a multicart consisting of 52 individual video games, released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis consoles by Active Enterprises. It was initially sold for the comparatively high price of $200 USD (or "less than $4 for each game"), and became notorious among gamers for the poor quality of its games. Many video game collectors covet Action 52 for its notoriety and rarity.

The cartridge states that it contains 52 "new and original exciting games". The games cover a variety of genres, although the most common are scrolling shooters and platform games. Examples of scrolling shooters include Star Evil, G-Force, Thrusters, and Megalonia. All but one of the games are single player, the exception being Fire Breathers, a simple two-player fighting game. The majority of the titles included on the cartridge have significant glitches. Some games load other games when selected.

The Addams Family is a platform game based on the characters and settings from the movie (which, in turn, is based on the famous 1960's television series, which in turn is based on Charles Addams cartoon of the same name, which was featured in the magazine, The New Yorker, in the 30's).

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.

Assuming the role of Uncle Fester, the player embarks on a quest to save the Addams' town from an alien invasion. Along the way, Fester encounters Addams Family characters such as Thing, Wednesday Addams, and Pugsley Addams, all of whom help him by giving him with different weapons and items. The game uses Blaster Master's overhead shooter engine.

Fester may enter certain buildings, which transform the game from its standard overhead view into a 3D mode of play akin to a dungeon crawl. In most buildings, Fester encounters one of five enormous Alien Boss characters, which upon defeat will supply him with a puzzle piece (a picture of the alien's UFO) and refill all of his items. After defeating a boss, Fester will leave the building and be unable to backtrack through it to previously visited areas.

    <desc>This, I think, is the sequel to Heroes of the Lance. Heroes of the Lance is, well, barely playable, and therefore not very fun. Dragons of Flame turns the Playable up a few notches, but the game still manages to be not very fun. To me, anyways. For starters, there's an overworld now. And you can go talk to people, who respond in Japanese! Whee! And monsters run into you, Zelda II-style, and then you fight them in a side-view, also Zelda II-style. Except, the monsters beat the hell out of you and you can't really do much about it. Except heal constantly. Whee, just like a real RPG! Okay I'm done.

Translation Description:

Everything is translated as of this release, and the job done on it is superb. Overall a very nice translation.

Take to the skies as a mighty Dragon! Defend your homeland from the threat of the Dark Queen Takhisis and her evil dragon invaders. A standard overhead-view shooter, with a dragon instead of a plane or spaceship, and of course fire breath instead of guns.

Graphically, Dragon Strike is pretty well-done. The backgrounds are nice-looking, varied enough to be interesting yet simple enough not to interfere with game-play. The only problem I see is that a few of the characters are too small to be recognizable, otherwise they are drawn well to represent their D&amp;D inspirations.

The sound in Dragon Strike I would have to rate as average. Nothing spectacular, nothing that will drive you to puncture your ears with an ice pick.

Overall, a pretty good game to try out, so give it a shot. Plenty of fun, challenge, and variation make Dragon Strike worth playing through at least three times (one for each dragon!).

Directions:

Dragon Strike is definitely a game worth checking out. Especially for D&amp;D fans, you have Dragons, of course, and a lot of other D&amp;D type characters and monsters. Choose from three types of Dragon to play: Bronze, Silver, or Gold.

Each has different speed, agility, attack power, and armor. Also their breath weapons have various effects. The Bronze uses a web effect which traps opponents temporarily, and the Silver's ice breath freezes an enemy for a while.

One of the most interesting things about the game-play of Dragon Strike is the altitude control. While there are only two settings, low or high, the difference actually matters in the game. Most enemies on the ground are too small to hit from high altitude, but when you fly low to attack them, you might run into trees, rocks or buildings and thus take damage. So be careful how you fly! Of course you can also use this to your advantage to dodge high attacks from flying enemies.

Unfortunately your breath attacks get weaker as you lose health. This can make the game pretty difficult because it's hard to regain life, and being weaker means having to work much harder to complete a mission while spending much more time in danger of losing more life which you can't afford. 

Controls:

A Button: Narrow Breath Weapon
B Button: Wide Breath Weapon
Up Button: Fly Low
Down Button: Fly High
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Choose Type of Dragon

    <desc>
Based on the later parts of the Dragon Lance book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the heroes are descending into a ruined city in search of the disks of Mishakal. Rumour has it that they are in a dragon's possession named Khisanth.

This game is pretty hard to play at first. The controls are sluggish and hard to figure out. The game starts without giving you any storyline, and your party is already formed and in the middle of a dungeon. The graphics are pretty good, but the poor gameplay keeps this game from being a pleasant experience. It is worth a look if you are a fan of D&amp;D or just RPG's in general. Other than that, you prolly won't like it.

Directions:

The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze-like map using doors to change the view. The convoy consists of the eight Heroes of the Lance. You have to use one at a time, but you can change characters whenever you want by pressing Start and using the Hero Select tool.

Simply press A on the guy you want to use, and put him in the frontman's spot. You can also use items, cast spells and equip weapons and armor from the menu.

Each character has different types of attacks and spells, making them more suited to fighting different enemies, as well as acting as lives. When you do get into a fight, just tap A to attack. If your character has a bow and arrow, hold down and press A to fire. To keep your defenses up, equip the armor that makes your armor class lowest.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: None
Select Button: Menu

Hints:

Order
- The order your characters start off in is no good. Try this: Caramon, Sturm, Raistlin, Goldmoon, Riverwind, Tanis, Flint, and Tasslehoff.

    <name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Hillsfar</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Run around completing random quests, and try not to fall off your horse too often. All the quests involve finding treasure or information of some kind from various locations throughout the game. Basically you just collect gold and healing potions, but you can't do anything with the gold anyway. Moving around the city to find clues to the next quest is very tedious, and moving from the city to other locations to pursue quest leads is ridiculously difficult. The only fighting in the game occurs at the arena, which you have to do if you're a fighter, if not you'll only end up there if caught by the guards while searching a building.

Directions:

I think I can safely say that Hillsfar is the Worst Role-Playing Game Ever Made. Actually I changed my mind, it's only safe to say that if you accept that this is an RPG in the first place, which it really isn't, despite the AD&amp;D title.

There is absolutely no role playing involved. Your primary goal seems to consist of breaking into people's houses and stealing all their money without getting caught by the guards. Even when you are doing your job, following the missions given by your guild or whatever, you are always an outlaw. Your alignment doesn't matter. Your class doesn't matter. Clerics can't heal themselves, Magic-Users can't use magic, and Thieves are the only class that have any trouble stealing things, because everyone else can just break the lock, while a thief is supposed to use lock picks, which is nearly impossible and results in a bag full of broken tools rather than getting away with the loot.

The first thing you're meant to do is wander around Hillsfar until you run into your guild. The guild master will tell you what he wants you to do next, and then you'll wander around the city looking for whatever he sent you out for. There are fifty thousand doors in Hillsfar, most of which have nothing to do with you, they're just a chance for you to get caught stealing. The doors that mean something at least have labels on them, but you'll wish the game would stop bothering you with all the ones just called 'door'. In any case, eventually you'll get to a point where no one is telling you what you should do next, in that case you just wander around breaking into places until you stumble on a clue for your next job.

A lot of the quests require you to move between various locations nearby Hillsfar. You ride your horse and try to jump all the obstacles and duck the arrows and birds that try to knock you down. You can't possibly avoid all the obstacles, eventually your horse will run away because you keep crashing, then you get to walk to the trading post, getting mugged along the way, and hope you managed to keep enough gold to buy a new horse. Or at least a broken-down used one.

Speaking of getting mugged, isn't this supposed to be a D&amp;D game? Don't you get at least a chance to fight off your attackers? Oh yeah, I had almost forgotten, this is NOT a role-playing game. You get caught by bandits. You get caught by the guards. You get caught by anyone or anything whose job it is to catch you, and there's nothing you can do about it.

But at least you're on a grand quest, to accomplish great things and earn great rewards, right? No. All the quests are the same. Well, technically most of them are randomly generated, but they are identical in spirit. A maze of rooms with treasure chests on the floor. You have two seconds to decide you shouldn't have come in here before the guards are summoned. Then while the timer counts down you run around opening the chests, most of which are locked, so I hope you didn't play as a thief. About halfway through the timer countdown, you get a message that the exit can now be found, meaning that it magically appeared at some random location on the map. It also means that the guards have just entered the room.

The guards are the stupidest things in the universe ever. They will try to stop you from getting to the treasure chests, and they can trap you in corners or small hallways, but even if they surround you, they won't do anything until the timer runs out. You just have to stand there and wait. You can't fight them, I may have already mentioned that. They take any treasure you may have just found, and either just kick you out, or send you to the arena.

Thank goodness. The arena. Finally a place where you can fight something. A chance to use the D&amp;D rules in order to do something cool. Maybe I'll cast a Fireball. Maybe I can heal myself, he won't be expecting that. Maybe I can get behind him and stab him in the back for extra damage. Oh, no, wait, I did it again. This isn't a D&amp;D game. This isn't even a role-playing game. All I can do is swing this stick and hope it makes contact. This guy is gonna kill me, isn't he?

- No matter what class you want to be, you want 18 Strength and 18 Dexterity for this game. This will let you break locks and avoid traps with ease.

This is one of the first games to incorporate the "golden box" game engine. This RPG is a good example of an excellent port from one medium to another. There were a PC and a C64 version, and the NES version featured original music, its own interface, and had different graphics. The graphics were good on the NES version. There was a nice amount of detail to the character's faces. This game allowed you to build your own party and characters, giving you total control.

The story was very detailed and interesting. It was in a Forgotten Realms setting, and they almost always deliver. That, with open ended gameplay, made for a gaming experience much like real D&amp;D. The major difference being that you don't get to pick your feats and skills.

Directions:

Free Phlan from Tyranthraxus. There are several missions you can undertake that will earn rewards. Not all of them are mandatory. All you really have to do is clear the outer areas of Phlan so you can get to Valjevo Castle and fight Tyranthraxus.

Be sure you have enough experience before you attempt to beat him, though. As with all RPGs, be sure to check everything and talk to everyone.

Controlling your party is pretty close playing tabletop D&amp;D. You use the d-pad when not in combat, in a first-person view. To perform actions, just hit the A button to bring up the menu. From there you will be able to equip weapons and armor, make camp, use items, etc. Once you spot an enemy, you will have to decide whether or not to engage. If you do decide to fight, it will go into an overhead view of round-based combat. Each one of your characters will get their turn. On his/her turn you will be able to move and fight, or preform other actions that take the same amount of time. You can even delay your turn if you want. This will give your next turn sooner. D&amp;D rules apply, things like moving out of threatened areas will provoke attacks of opportunity. Remember to search your enemy's bodies after you defeat them.

B Button: Cancel

Undead
- Remember that slashing weapons only do half damage to undead creatures.

    <desc>This hack was started back in December 2007. Most of the levels were finished by mid February. The title screen was ripped from the translated NES ROM "Adventure Island 4". Since I am an amateur ROM hacker (is there a professional ROM Hacker?) in every sense of the word, this took much longer to edit than someone with more experience and abilities. Also you'll notice that the palette on the title screen is a little off :P

All 8 worlds and 8 levels each have been altered. (with the exception of world 4-4 although most enemies have been changed) This is not meant to be a "hardtype" hack but later levels can be very challenging. All levels can be completed without any enhancements. (hammer, dinosaur etc.) However it is recommended that you save your items for later levels.

I've tested this patch thoroughly but there is always a chance I missed something somewhere. If you do find a glitch, I'd like to know about it so drop me a line at aetherknight2k@aol.com

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
Six villagers have been kidnapped and they need you to rescue them. You must avoid the pirates until you find the special candle. With this candle, you can either toss it at the enemy characters, or use it to ignite the cannons. When you have gathered all of the villagers, you must light the signal fire to complete this section.

THE HAUNTED HOUSE
This thriller has the scariest ghouls and ghosts in the Magic Kingdom! You will start this level with a limited supply of candles (the monsters hate the light). You'll need to collect extra candles as you progress through this nightmarish section. You will need a lot of candles to defeat the Master Spectre!

BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN
On this attraction you'll have to steer a coal train across some pretty rough tracks. Avoid the dead ends, wrong-way crossing guards and rolling boulders as you head for the Goal station.

AUTOPIA
Peg leg Pete challenges you to a rough and ready auto race. Defeat him to claim one of the silver keys as your victory trophy. Be careful not to collide with the marker cones or the side of the track as this slows the car down. If you leave the track you'll have to start again.

SPACE MOUNTAIN
Command a starship as Mickey Mouse gives you navigation signals to reach star "F". The screen shows the command console and the view of space. One of six signals will flash on the console mini-screen to direct your ship. When an arrow points up, down, left, or right press those directions on the control pad. When a meteor appears on the main viewing screen, you'll see a picture of a button on the left or right side of the mini-screen.

--From the NES Adventures in the Magic Kingdom instruction manual.

Overview:

You're at the Magic Kingdom. A parade is about to start. But there's a slight problem. Mickey Mouse can't find the golden key! He asks Goofy where it is, and it's in the castle. But to add to Mickey's misfortune, to open the castle, he needs 6 silver keys.

Now you come into play. Mickey wants you to travel all over his magical kingdom to find the 6 silver keys. Can you do it, or will you let Mickey down? 

Directions:

This game isn't all that fun, and eventually, it just gets frustrating. You're running around, failing stuff. You only get 3 hit points, and if you fail to accomplish an activity 3 times, such as the Haunted House or the Mining Cart ride, it's game over. However, if you want more frustration, continues are given to you. So if you like being frustrated, hit "play now" and start the game.

The main features include altered levels (altered both color wise and structure wise), altered colors (different enemy palettes, a altered sprites, and even a different storyline. Gamers should find the hack more challenging than the original Mega Man 2.

The game is basically Bass being the hero and Dr. Light as the enemy.

You play the role of Bayou Billy (duh!) and your archenemy Gordo has kidnapped your girlfriend, Annabelle. You now must save her. But there are tough obstacles to overcome, making your quest a bit harder...OK, a LOT harder! Do you have what it takes?

The Adventures of Bayou Billy was a great example of a good idea that was applied badly. The game had three different types of gameplay, but it was just too hard. Billy only had two or three fighting moves and the controls were slow. I didn't even make it past the first level without cheating. If you can make it to the driving and shooting levels it gets a little easier, but until then it's too hard. The graphics looked good and the sound wasn't bad, it was just hard to play. I'm sure that someone used to like this game, but it's just too hard to be fun.

Directions:

There are three parts of the game: fighting, driving, and shooting. During the shooting part you can use the light gun or the controller. The other two parts you just use the controller. During the fighting levels, you can find weapons such as a whip, a gun, a knife, or a club.

You can also find a bullet proof jacket that will protect you from bullets and knives. Enemies will be wearing this sometimes as well. Enemies will drop meat sometimes, this will refill your life bar.

During the shooting levels, the power-ups are a little different. The bulletproof vest makes you invincible for a short time. A bullet will give you forty rounds of ammo. A first aid kit will refill your life. An hourglass will give you unlimited ammo for a short time. A star will destroy all enemies on the screen. A Billy will give you one-up. While shooting as many bad guys as you can, try not to miss too much cause you will only lose bullets when you miss.

The only power-ups to find on the driving stages are gas cans. They will give you ten extra seconds. While driving, you must shoot enemy soldiers as well as planes that are trying to kill you. 

Controls:

A Button: Kick
B Button: Punch, fire weapon
A+B Buttons: Jump Kick
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Switch to gun (if you have ammo)

Hints:

Earn 100 Extra Bullets in Regular Mode
- To earn 100 extra bullets in regular mode, defeat shooting in practice mode.

"It was magic most foul," Intoned one of the elders solemnly.

"Nonsense!" scoffed another, "It was simply science... thieves make good use of technology."

"Good use?" raged the third.

The elders of Osmic had come in full regalia, feathers and banners and the heavy gold chains of office, but the formal procession of leaders had not carried the hereditary badges of office- the Crown of Ages, the Mystical Gems of Lascorbanos or the Thousand Coins of Tenure. These had been stolen, most wickedly purloined, in an attempt to jeopardize the forthcoming festivities of the Trimillenial and were now reputedly hidden on the planet Tambi.

So they came to you- Captain Comic, galactic hero, righter of wrongs, and all around nice guy. It was most gratifying- ignore the rumor that they had gone to Orion O'Brian, that mercenary thug, and he had turned them down, calling the job "insanely dangerous" and saying the entire planet of Tambi, from its endless blue lakes to its impossibly blue moon, had not one cubic centimeter where a person could feel safe- nor a single benign life form. Tambi was a land of surprises- all bad.

Well, you're on the job now. Using your keen wits and well-honed reflexes, you must traverse the ever-changing and treacherous environs of Tambi and return the treasures of Osmic in time for the Trimillenial celebrations. Succeed, and you will be honored as a hero once more; fail, and three thousand years of galactic peace and prosperity crumble to comic- uh- cosmic dust.

--From the NES Captain Comic instruction manual.

Gameplay:

Captain Comic follows many standard platformer conventions. The player has health, lives, a score, and a set of useful items. The game is divided into a number of major areas (see list above), and each area is divided generally into three smaller "zones". Transitioning between zones plays a short tune and marks a "safe point", since all enemies are removed from the screen and Comic's position is saved.

Comic has twelve "shield" points (health), but each time an enemy hits him, two points are removed. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, Comic is still alive, but will die on the next hit. (Thus Comic must be hit seven times to die, from full shield). Occasionally, shields can be found which instantly replenish Comic's health to full, or if it is already full, grant him an extra life. Comic starts the game with four lives, and can go up to a maximum of five. If Comic is killed by either falling off the bottom of the screen, or being hit with no shield points remaining, a life is lost and he is returned to the point where he last entered this zone. If all lives are lost, the game ends.

Many of the games enemies have different AI behaviour compared to one another - ranging from simple bouncing off the walls and pre-set paths to creatures who seek the player out and turn to follow Comic as he passes by. Enemies are generally restricted to their own area (Space Pollen is only on the moon, for example), and a few move faster than the others. All enemies have the same gameplay property which is that if they touch Comic, the enemy is destroyed and Comic suffers two points of shield damage. Once he has picked up a Blastola Cola (the first one is found at the very start of the game), Comic may shoot at enemies. If he hits an enemy, it is destroyed and points are scored.

Since there is no time limit to the game, it is generally preferable to be patient and clear each zone of the dangerous enemies present there. This also has the desired result of increasing the score.

Items:

Each area that Comic travels through gets progressively more difficult, particularly in terms of the enemies Comic must dispose of or the terrain and maze structure that he must pass through. Thankfully, there are items that are useful or required to navigate certain areas, defeat various enemies and eventually to recover the treasures themselves.

These items are:

+ Blastola Cola - A drink that allows Comic to fire projectiles at his enemies. Each cola he drinks permanently increases his firepower abilities. More technically, each cola increases the total number of projectiles that can be on the screen at once, up to a maximum of 5.
+ Shield - Replenishes "shield" points (health) to full, or if already full it grants an extra life.
+ Corkscrew - Causes Comic's projectiles to bounce up and down, allowing him to hit enemies that are normally below his firing line. (Especially, those that roll on the ground).
+ Door key - Allows Comic to open doors. Comic cannot leave the first area until he has collected the door key.
+ Boots - Increase Comic's jump height. The boots are required to get over certain obstacles.
+ Lantern - Allows Comic to see in dark areas. This object is only useful for making it possible to see inside the castle at the end of the game.
+ Teleport Wand - Gives Comic the ability to teleport short distances. When used properly, this lets him reach new places and get away from enemies.

Ah yes, the pre-historic times, where dinosaurs just weren't confined in zoos! The main character, Riki, is a very courageous man, who will take the fate of mankind in his hands. But with dinos all around, will our friend get the job done? Only you can decide that! Happy gaming!

Directions:

Vertical shooting game! You keep moving upward, and you must either defeat the enemies or dodge them completely. You can also pick up power-ups, which are far superior to your basic projectile. The bad thing is: your weapon can only shoot forward, which can cause some frustration. But if you're a true blue gamer, you can do it!

Controls:

A Button: Jump, (Hold) Fly if you have a Bird Tile
B Button: Shoot missile
Start Button: Start game, pause/unpause

Hints:

Continue Game
- When you get Game Over, hold Up and press Start on the 'Game Over' screen to continue the same level you died on.

Some time after King Egger's latest defeat, the country of Eden was at peace. One day, when Lolo and Lala are taking a break, King Egger (or his descendant according to the English manual) comes into a town and uses some magic to turn all the inhabitants to stone. Only Lolo and Lala were unaffected, as King Egger specifically targeted the town. They must set out to defeat King Egger and break his spell.

The game features a total of 17 levels with 100 different puzzle rooms, 9 boss rooms, and 10 training rooms. Levels 3, 13, and 17 have 10 rooms each. The other levels only have 5 rooms. Levels 4-7, 9-12, and 17 have a boss at the end. The two big trees on the overworld map are where the training rooms are, each tree having five rooms each.

After the defeat of King Egger, Lolo and Lala return home. However, King Egger returns and once again captures Lala. He takes her to his castle in the sky, which is afloat above a large tower. The castle is accessible after Lolo clears all 9 floors of the tower.

Once again, Lolo must set out to rescue Lala from King Egger. The major improvements made were some of the monster graphics were better-drawn, mainly Gol, Rocky, Skull, Medusa, and Don Medusa. Other differences include new puzzles and greater difficulty than The Adventures of Lolo. Some of the puzzles are even taken from the older games in the Eggerland series. The game features a total of 50 different puzzle rooms, and an actual fight with the King Egger at the end. This is the first game Lolo can actually fight against Egger himself.

Also featured are 4 hidden Pro puzzle rooms, which are available for players who want to try very challenging rooms.

The Great Devil has kidnapped Princess Lala! It's up to Prince Lolo to go to the haunted castle and navigate through the Devil's many mazes, ultimately defeating the Great Devil and rescuing Lala.

Directions:

Adventures of Lolo is a cute little puzzle game. The point of each level is to collect all the Heart blocks, which will open up a chest containing a jewel. When you get the jewel, the room is cleared of monsters and the door opens to the next level.

Each room is a maze of various blocks, including Heart blocks, Emerald blocks which you can push around, One-Way Passes which only allow movement in one direction, rocks, trees and water. The rooms are also populated with monsters who will try to block your path or destroy you. Most monsters become more dangerous after the jewel chest opens, so try to get a clear path to the chest when you get the last Heart.

Some Heart blocks will give you Magic Shots. Use them to turn enemies into an egg temporarily. You can push eggs around, and sometimes you can push them into the river and use them as a raft, but if the water is not flowing then Lolo will sink. Shooting an egg will make it fly out of the screen if you need to clear a path where a monster is. The monster will return to its original position after a short time.

Finally there are some tools which become available when you need them, which you can use after you pick up certain Hearts. Bridges can be used to cross small streams, Hammers can be used to destroy rocks in your way, and One-way tools are used to reverse the direction of a One-Way Pass.

If you get stuck in a level and realize that you can't beat it from where you are, press Select to restart the level with one less life remaining.

A Button: Use Magic Shot or Tool
B Button: Not used

Select Button: Suicide

    <desc>This game rocks. Really rocks . . . It plays almost entirely like Dragon Warrior, with a Japanese flavor and dialogue that is a hundred times funnier (i.e. - "I will defeat Kojiro, and maybe even get laid!"). But then again, I've read Shakespearean Tragedies funnier than Dragon Warrior's dialogue. And the enemies are absolutely ridiculous looking . . . I mean, a corn cobb monster. A god-damned corn cobb. It would be embarassing in my mind if I ever died at the hands of a cobb of corn (ok, so it killed me 10 times so far, but we'll ignore that detail ;). Now, go and play this game right now, or I'll kill you dead where sit. I don't know how, and I don't know when . . . but I will =P.

Translation Description:

The hacking and translation for this game are both really great, especially when you consider that DW-type RPGs are a pain in the ass to translate. Believe me, I've been there. The readme says there's still some bugs, but I got about an hour, maybe two hours into it with no problems. So at the very least, you can play this for five minutes and laugh at how cool it is before you move on to the next rom in your collection. I wouldn't recommend it though. Cmon, the game's fun!

The Adventures of Rad Gravity was a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System published by Activision in 1990. It was developed by Interplay Productions.

The game was a platformer with a wacky storyline in which the eponymous main character explored multiple planets and fought enemies while jumping through levels. The game was notable for a level in which the protagonist was drawn upside down and gravity was reversed. The main character had a comically large head, and his early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber.

This is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel. The game plays out much like an episode of the show. The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum. Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

So, Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls. Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show.

    <desc>
In this game, you are Tom Sawyer. You are day dreaming in class, and since you are quite the little scamp, you day dream of wild and crazy things. Like being on board a pirate ship all the way to Crazy Injun Joe's Cave.

The graphics look a little flat, no texture. The sound also left something to be desired with a lot of white noise sounds in the music. The controls were a little unresponsive, making it difficult to get very far into the first level. All this coupled with an uninteresting story leaves you wanting a real game to play.

Directions:

Help Tom Sawyer make his way through the peril in his dream world by making it through all six levels, and defeating each boss. You can also choose to be Huck Finn by using the second controller. He plays just like Tom, he just looks different. The bosses are made up of a giant octopus, a giant crocodile, six monkeys that form a huge gorilla, a blue devil, a zeppelin, and of course, Injun Joe himself.

There are several items you can grab on the way. The T icons will give you an extra man after you collect twenty, but watch out for the skull icons. They will take away ten T's. The slingshot will allow you to make more powerful shots with a straight trajectory. If you find a heart, it will make you invincible for a few seconds. Other than that, you only have one hit point for the whole game, which makes it extremely difficult.

When you play After Burner, you're flying high and fast... in the F-14 Thunder Cat - the leanest, meanest fighting machine ever made. And the free world needs you and your set of wings desperately: Naval Intelligence has pin-pointed the two locations where the enemy has hidden its diabolical two-party plan to conquer the world! To get to these sites, you're called upon to use every ounce of your flying and combat skills to survive bogies, missiles and tracers that are dying to blow you out of the sky!

--From the NES After Burner instruction manual.

Overview:

This huge arcade hit After Burner makes a cameo on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It's a pretty good flight simulator that makes its Sega Master System counterpart look a bit dull. The Master System's was choppy and the sound was less than stellar. The gameplay is also much quicker in this version. Tengen and Sega did a pretty good job here, but it's simply impossible to take an arcade game, convert it to the NES, and make it look just like it did in your local arcade. After Burner was a pretty good game despite the limitations of the NES.

Directions:

Fly your jet and shoot all other jets you see, it's that simple. 

Controls:

A Button: Fire Vulcan cannon
B Button: Shoot air-to-air guided missiles
Start Button: Start; activate after burner
Select Button: Pause game

Hints:

Pilot Skills
- Your chances of surviving aerial combat improve as you master flying the F-14 Thunder Cat. Learn to roll your jet at the right time and you'll be able to dodge almost anything.

- Some of the enemy aircraft will start firing before you even see them, so be extra careful. Be ready do dodge quickly at all times, or you'll pay the price.

Eight deadly Air Fortresses are speeding through space on a course of destruction, feeding off planets and entire solar systems. Whole fleets have been demolished in the attempt to stop or even slow down the invading juggernauts. However, there is hope that one man may succeed where armadas of star ships have failed, by infiltrating the Air Fortress and finding a way to disable it from the inside. You are that man! You must penetrate the defenses, find your way through the labyrinthine halls, and destroy the main reactor to stop each mighty Air Fortress before they consume your home world.

This is one of the more fun games I've played for such a level of simplicity. The graphics are decent, the main character is a bit simple but the enemies and backgrounds are pretty neat. The sound effects are pretty much standard, while the music might become a hazard to your mental stability after a while, which is also standard for games of the time. The game-play is plenty of fun. It's not as crazy hard as a lot of games in the same category, but it has nuances that make it interesting, for example moving with your jet-pack: you are never stable, gravity is pulling you down, firing pushes you backwards, occasionally gravity generators pull you down faster or pull in different directions, etc.

Directions:

Each level consists of two sections of play: First the penetration of the Air Fortress's outer defenses, called the 'Air Base', in a side-scrolling shooter of the Section-Z variety, only a bit less hectic.

Controls:

After you pass this section, you will take an elevator into the main core of the space station. In the first level it's pretty straight-forward, but later levels become complicated mazes. Think Metroid with a jet-pack. Your goal is to find and shut down (i.e. by blowing it up) the core reactor, then escape before the Air Fortress explodes with you inside. I suggest finding the escape pod before attacking the reactor ;-)

The most important thing in the Air Base section is to collect Energy Capsules (E) and Bombs (B). Energy capsules increase your maximum energy, which lets you live and fight longer. Bombs do more damage than your standard gun and are necessary to defeat certain enemies (You won't be able to blow certain reactors without enough bombs). Also found in the Air Base section are (+) icons which instantly destroy all enemies on-screen, and Barrier icons (diamond shape) which make you invincible for a few seconds. Use these to collect hard-to-reach (E) and (B) power-ups.

Inside the Air Fortress, you must watch your energy carefully. Everything costs you energy, from flying to shooting, even just walking. If you stand still your energy will recharge up to a point, but when you are damaged by an enemy that energy is lost permanently. Just remember to rest after a long flight or lots of shooting, so you will be less vulnerable.

B Button: Launch Bombs
Start Button: Start, Pause

Using the Airwolf, our latest in helicopter gunship technology, rescue POWs from enemy prison camps. Shoot down enemy planes and blow up radar towers, but don't get shot down yourself.

A flight simulator in a helicopter, with limited graphics and sound. The ground is big and green, the sky is big and blue. The enemy planes are little pictures of a plane with no animation. Your bullets are little gray dots, and missiles are big gray dots.

Directions:

Well, let's see. I think Airwolf is one of those games that was well-intentioned but poorly executed. The basics are like this: It's a flight simulator using a helicopter instead of a plane, which is OK.

Your enemies are jets which outnumber you hundreds to one, which is OK if you have enough control over your own vehicle to take on those kind of odds, but you don't. Your mission is to rescue POWs, which requires a special landing sequence, like the old Lunar Lander game, where you tap Up to keep from falling too fast. Of course it's complicated by two huge towers you have to avoid, and incoming anti-aircraft fire. On the other hand, if you don't get to the POWs before you get severely damaged or run out of missiles, you can go to a friendly air base for repairs and a resupply of munitions. Same landing sequence. Which begs the question, if they could build an airbase and ammo dump that close to the prison camp, why are they sending in a single helicopter to make the rescue?

Now on to the controls, or lack thereof. First, you have Up making you go Up and Down making you go Down, which is the reverse of every other flight sim out there. Second, you have to try to shoot down incoming enemy missiles to avoid damage, but you can't move fast enough to target them before they get to you. Third, sometimes you get slowed down to ZERO for no apparent reason and without warning, and after you get killed you might realize you couldn't move because you weren't moving. And speaking of speed you have to slow down to land in the base or prison camp, if you go too fast over them you'll just fly by. So, to sum up, the controls are just complicated enough to make them hard to use, without actually being useful enough to play the game.

Controls:

A Button: Fire Machine Gun
B Button: Fire Missiles
Start Button: Speed up
Select Button: Slow Down

Hints:

Missiles
- Use your missiles. All the time. You can always get more. This is especially important if you want to take out the enemy's control tower. Blow it up with missiles to reduce the number of planes attacking you.

Note from Rx: This is not the offical FDS version of the rom, but an unlicensed NES port.  It plays better on the NES with faster loading times and less drag, so I chose this one to be in the set instead.

The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.

    <desc>
The player takes the role of a chicken named Alfred who must find his way through bizarre levels full of balloons, telephones, cheese and other strange elements. While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time.

To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked.

Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make a giant flower give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.

The music in Alfred Chicken is usually upbeat and silly. Mixed with the gameplay and characters, the overall feel of the game can be described as similar.

Marketing:

Karl Fitzhugh, the Product Manager of the Amiga version of the Alfred Chicken video game, ran as the Alfred Chicken Party candidate in the 1993 by-election in the Christchurch, Dorset constituency. The exercise was done to promote the original game's release. Fitzhugh finished second last with 18 votes, two votes ahead of the Rainbow Party candidate.[1]

The marketing attempt was partially successful. The Alfred Chicken Party was cited, along with other "frivolous or 'commercial' candidates" as a reason to increase the number of signatures required for an individual to be nominated as a political candidate at election.[2]

There was also a toll free number set up where you could call and Alfred himself would give a promotional speech about the game. It was setup after the game was released in the United States.

Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the alien who terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The game play of the various Alien 3 conversions varies from platform to platform. The Genesis Alien 3 game is side scrolling action game with large maze-like levels.

    <desc>
The year is 2089 of the Galactic Calendar. In this far-flung future, humans have colonized the outer planets. Without warning, the glory of this achievement turned into disaster: A horrible race of aliens has imprisoned an entire colony aboard its space ships! Each of these vessels houses countless numbers of slimy monsters led by a vicious alien "boss". Having miraculously escaped capture, you must go from ship to ship in a valiant effort to save your fellow humans.

--From the NES Alien Syndrome instruction manual.

Overview:

Alien Syndrome was ported from the arcade to the NES pretty well. Most aspects of the game were retained from their arcade counterparts. While the game was a little slow, it was still a lot of fun. The music was repetitive because it was the same on every level. The boss music went faster and was sufficient to get you a little nervous. The two player game definitely made for a good time. Pros: good port from arcade to NES, good graphics and controls. Cons: slow when there are too many enemies on screen, and repetitive music.

Directions:

There are two characters you can play, Ricky or Mary. They play just the same, they just look different. I guess girls need a girl hero or something. If you play two players, one of you will be Ricky, and the other will be Mary, in simultaneous play. Good luck fighting over who gets to be trans-gendered.

In each stage you have 240 seconds to rescue 12 people. After that, it's on to a timed fight with the boss. You don't have to keep the enemies from touching the people, or worry about accidentally shooting them. They can't die, so just rescue them before time runs out. After you touch them you have them with you.

There are several power-ups to know about. A "?" will give you 200 points. An "L" will give you a laser that will shoot right through your enemies. The "F" will give you a flame thrower. The "FB" will give you the ability to shoot fireballs. An "S" will restore your default weapon. The "W" will warp you to a different spot in the same level. There are no power-ups to give you more life, because you only have one hit point. You have three lives and after that, it's game over. 

Controls:

A Button: N/A
B Button: Fire
Start Button: Start, Pause, Map
Select Button: Select number of players, Choose character

Hints:

Level Select
- Press Down + Start on Controller One and Right on Controller Two at the same time.

    <desc>Just a few words to get you started... I am a 35-year old graphic designer from Mexico with permanent joypad scars (OK... not really) and this is my very first serious attempt of a ROM mod... honestly! I am good at drawing cartoons and skillful with my hands so it was easy once I got the hang of it.

For the last three years, I had seen a number of attempts at altering the NES Punch-Out!! game, with varying results. Some were OK, some were terrible. That's one of the things that urged me to fullfill a long-time wish - to create a version of my own that truly captured the spirit of Nintendo and Punch-Out!! However, I have a full-time job and real life problems to deal with like the next person, so I didn't have the time or the patience to do it.

Then I heard about the Nintendo Short Cuts contest held by mid-2007. Many great videos were created and entered, but there was one which caught my eye... probably because it was based on one of my all-time faves... Punch-Out!! (yeah, I'm biased) Not only did this video evoke many warm, earnest memories from my long gone teenage years, but caught my imagination from an artistic point of view. It was very well done, and chock full of references to the vintage, 80's NES and arcade games. 

I then learned they didn't win the contest. Damn, they didn't even make the Top 10. WHY? The vid harnessed the very essence of Punch-Out!! I was outraged - and I was not alone. Over One Million Views and over 4,000 comments at Youtube speak by themselves. That's when I decided this artistic manifestation HAD to receive the credit it deserved. This HAD to become a game... of sorts.

I surfed the web and learned the basics. I downloaded some apps. I had previous knowledge of Tile Layer Pro but was scared as hell to use it because the sprites were always scattered. I didn't care. I started and then some... it began to move and flow. Then I found Toma's unvaluable guide named The Palette Doc Thing, which explained how palettes worked and even included a chart showing all 64 NES colors! In no time, I was switching between four different programs - sprites, palettes, hex, emulator - and then it was completed. My heart was filled with joy.

I know what is like to have a pet project and develop it, watch it grow and evolve like a child. This is what this mod became... a work of love. And a form of recognition for a very Awesome Team which should have won that contest.

Thank you, Team Awesome. And thanks all Punch-Out!! fans and their kind comments. This work is for each and every one of you. You made it possible. Now it's up to you to decide if I did a good job - I look forward to hear your comments and suggestions to continue working on this project and improving it in the future.

Now go and... GIVE HIM ZEE UPPERCUT!!  ;-)

There are four modes of gameplay. 1-Player, which pits you in a solo match against a computer opponent. 2-Player, which is a co-op match against a computer opponent. Versus, which is a 2 player mode that pits you against each other. And finally, Watch, which oddly enough, allows you to watch a computer simulated match. The court is displayed in a vertical fashion, from a top-down perspective, revealing only half of the court at a time. If the ball travels past the half-court line, the screen goes black temporarily and changes over to the other half of the court (which looks identical, save for the color of the floorboards). This is done to alert the player that they have travelled to a different side of the court. When a player attempts a slam dunk, gameplay will pause and cut to a detailed animation of the maneuver.

This top down shooter plays a lot like Star Force, or 1942. It's a lot of ship to ship combat with power-ups placed throughout the levels. The graphics look decent, and the music is OK, but neither are great. The sprites are drawn well, but the backgrounds could use some texture. The sounds and music are very beepy and annoying.

The game is fun to play, but it's a little slow. You have to get speed-ups, but even then there's something a little laggy about it. It's a perfect example of mediocrity.

Directions:

Shoot down alien ships and guns atop of a mother ship in an "Alpha Mission." Whatever that means. It's almost exactly the same as 1942, but in space. Use various power-ups to help defeat your targets.

Anyone who usually enjoys a 1942 type of game will immediately adapt to this.

You can gain many power-ups for speed, weapons, and lives. Special power-ups shape your ship into something else with a much better gun to eliminate your enemies. An S is a speed up. An L will give you a laser. An M will upgrade your missiles. The K will maximize your power and it will even stay that way if you die. If you get a backwards "K", it will decrease your power level. The W is a warp, it will allow you to skip three levels. An R, on the other hand, will warp you back three levels. An F will open the pyramids for a short time. An E will increase your energy by two. A backwards "E" will take four energy points from you. Never get a C, because it will take all your energy and some of your power.

You can use your energy to improve your ship by hitting Select. From this menu you can pick one of eight different upgrades that will last as long as you have energy left. Your energy will go down as long as you are powered up. Octo will fire a powerful laser in eight directions. Shield will create a force-field around you. Any other time you just have one hit point. Canon will fire a wide range laser. Homing will give you homing missiles. Paralyser will fire a beam that will paralyse small enemies. Nuclear will fire missiles with nuclear warheads. Fire will shoot flames at enemies. Thunder will shoot lighting that will kill all the enemies on the screen. 

Controls:

A Button: Bomb
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: N/A

Hints:

How to beat the Final Boss
- To beat the last boss, you must have the best weapon, missiles, and ultimate speed. Shoot all the ships he sends at you. Eventually he will send a yellowish one -- hit it with a missile and it will bounce back. Keep doing this until you beat him.

    <desc>This is a version of Altered Beast that is stripped-down for the NES. As such, it's more-or-less just another pretty unremarkable (and frustrating) side-scrolling beat-'em-up. For those unfamiliar with Altered Beast, the gist of the game is that you are a warrior who comes back from the dead to punch and kick monsters through various levels because a god told you to. However, this is where THE GIMMICK comes in  as you collect power-ups, your warrior will gradually lose his clothes and grow larger man-boobs! Collect enough, and you can turn into some sort of were-animal, ranging from the slightly useful (wolf) to the absolutely ridiculous (teddy bear). So it's sort of like a beat-'em-up meets hentai game meets furry fantasy.

Translation Description:

As far as I can tell, this patch will translate that pesky Japanese title screen into something more familiar. I wish I could tell you more, but after spending about an hour being terrible at the game, the frustration got to me and I gave up hope that there might be translated text at the end. Plus, the readme doesn't really go into details, but considering the nature of the game that's fair enough.

Pure turbo racing - wheel to wheel - high speed combined with high tech. With Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing you're competing in the most challenging racing circuit in the world. It's a grueling battle through sixteen different courses through sixteen different countries.

Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing gives you incredible racing excitement and realism. And best of all it gives you Al Unser Jr. himself. Before each race, Al Unser Jr. personally gives you his expert inside tips on how to handle the course. Design your own car, or get ready to drive Unser's incredible red, white and blue race machine.

Go ahead - test yourself against the world's best. Many try but few succeed. With Al Unser Jr. the odds are in your favor.

--From the NES Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing instruction manual.

Overview:

Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing is a typical driving game. You get to race an Indy car. The thing that stood out in this game was the responsibility of shifting gears. Most racing games do it automatically. While it was pretty much some of the same old same old, it was still fun. The graphics were well drawn, they reminded me of Rad Racer. The audio was pretty annoying because there were a lot of sounds that sounded like white noise. The controls were responsive, which is essential for a racing game. This is a high action racer worth taking for a spin.

Directions:

The LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys steer your car left or right. Hit the UP arrow to shift up and the DOWN 

Controls:

A Button: Accelerator
B Button: Brake
Start Button: Start, Pause

Hints:

Turning
- Don't forget to brake around really sharp turns.

Amagon is another generic, hackneyed, regurgitated platformer. The graphics, while well-drawn, were poor in the choice of color palette. The sound wasn't good. The music was too high-pitched and beepy, and the sound effects were very annoying. The controls were easy to learn and responsive, but the game was very difficult because you only have one hit point, so be careful.

Directions:

Armed only with your rifle, you must journey across 6 dangerous zones that are split into two halves, and escape on a boat. At the end of each zone you will have to fight a boss. If you get hit once, you're dead.

The only time you have hit points is when you become Megagon.

You can turn into Megagon after you get the mega key and press Select. To increase the amount of hit points Megagon has, you must accumulate points. To get max hit points, get 70,000 points. You can jump 2x higher as Megagon. If you kill a boss in Megagon form, you revert back to normal afterwards.

There are point power-ups that will increase your point score by the number indicated on the power-up. The black crown gives you 10,000 extra points. There is also a bullet magazine that will have twenty bullets in it. If you find a smiley face, it will give you a one-up. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot/Swing Rifle, Uppercut
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Turn into Megagon

Hints:

Defeating the Elephant Man
- An Elephant Man will attack your character in level 2-1. Jump on the branch that is on the left end of the screen. Move as far to the left as possible on the branch to force Elephant Man to disappear from the screen.

    <desc>Translation Description:

A slot machine gambling game that thinks it's an RPG... just not a very good RPG. The game is a spin-off of the Pachio-kun games.

A simple translation hack, I used the game's own uppercase English font. Graphics hacking was limited to adding a small message to the title screen, and changing a single graphic to read 'BOOM' instead of 'BOM'.

    <name>American Gladiators</name>
    <path/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Based on the TV Game Show, you compete in five events against the infamous American Gladiators. Test your strength and stamina in Wall Climb, Joust, Powerball, Assault, and Human Cannonball.

Graphically, the makers of this game wanted you to be able to see what's going on but that's about it. The sprites are recognizable and not bad-looking but the animation is pretty poor I must say.

Directions:

American Gladiators isn't the best game of all time, but then the show wasn't the greatest either. Fans, don't kill me for saying so. Anyway the game is still pretty fun, even with the chunky graphics and cheesy sound.

Any game where you get to root for the underdog is sure to please, and in this game you get to play an average couch potato trying to take on ridiculously massive body-building hulks of humanity, in games where all that muscle might really come in handy. But you get to win anyway, because the American Gladiators aren't too big on brains.

Of the five competitions, you can choose to start on whichever one you want, and do them in any order. I'll present brief descriptions in the order as they are presented in the game.

Joust: Take padded sticks and try to knock each other off the platforms. Press left or right to move closer or farther from your opponent. Press Up or Down to aim your attacks high or low. Press A to attack, B to guard. After winning, press A to jump to the next platform for your next fight. You will face four Gladiators in a row.

Wall: Climb to the top of the wall, while the Gladiators try to knock you off. The A button controls your right hand, the B Button controls your left, so press them alternately in order to climb. Avoid Gladiators and obstacles which will cause you to fall. Try to get the Gladiators to run into the obstacles and fall.

Human Cannonball: Swing on a rope and try to knock the Gladiator off his platform. Press A to jump onto the rope, then A again to let go and fly into your opponent. This game is all about timing your jumps to get the right position on the rope and to hit the Gladiator at the right speed and angle.

Powerball: Try to get the balls into the baskets. Press A to grab a ball from the chute, then press A again when you are near the basket. You have to run back and forth because the balls appear in opposite chutes each time. The Gladiators will get in your way and knock the ball out of your hands. The ultimate goal is to get a ball in each basket, thereby earning an extra life. This is also the only game in which you can't lose a life.

Assault: Run through the course while the Gladiators shoot at you with a pitching machine. Try not to get hit (obviously). Press B to pick up the missile launchers when you find them, and press A to launch missiles. Claim victory either by making it to the finish line or by taking out the ball gun with your missiles. 

Hints:

Password
- To start at level 3 with 10 lives, select PASSWORD (but don't hit Start yet) then press A, B, B, A, B, then Start.

    <desc>
Obviously based on the awful movies of the same name, Nightmare on Elm Street pits a group of high school students against Freddy Krueger, who comes into their dreams and kills them in horrible ways. In order to defeat him you must travel Elm Street in an effort to collect Freddy's bones and destroy them forever (not) in the school's furnace.

Nightmare on Elm street is actually a pretty interesting game. The graphics aren't great but the gameplay is decent. The Dream Warriors add some variety, since you need to collect them all to get past certain areas, and you get to choose which one is most effective for any given situation.

Directions:

As you walk down Elm Street, look for open buildings. You have to go in, collect all the items there, and then fight the boss to get out. Freddy will also come occasionally and try to get you, just fight him off as best you can.

There are several items which are important to collect.

First, obviously, the bones, which will be scattered through the various buildings. Next are cups of coffee which refill your sleep meter, and a radio which will wake you up from the dream realm. Finally, the Dream Warrior tokens which give you special powers in the dream world to help you defeat Freddy. The runner icon gives you a javelin attack and a somersault jump. The yin-yang gives you a throwing star and jump kick. The wizard hat gives you a magical attack and hovering ability.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Up: Enter Building
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Choose between Dream Warrior Icons

Hints:

Sleep Meter
Your sleep meter will decline rapidly while you stand still, so always keep moving.

Dodge/Avoid Fights
Many fights in this game offer nothing but the chance to get hurt, so just avoid most enemies unless they are preventing you from accomplishing a vital task.

    <desc>This is one of Konami's first NES games from way back in the day, and the possible origin for their old obsession with penguins.

In Antarctic Adventure, you play the role of a penguin that goes around the South Pole on a race, visiting different stations for no reason at all. On the way you'll have to brave holes and seals while trying to catch fish and flags for extra points. Grab a flashing flag and you'll get a special boost which allows you to float for a few seconds once while jumping.

There's not much else to do in this game other than go forward and beat the clock. The game is fun, but it's also very simple, so many people will get bored of it rather quickly.

Translation Description:

This is one of the frickin' smallest patches we have hosted here. The game didn't really have much to translate other than one line. One FRICKIN' line. In the map screen, you formerly had three kanjis. Now there's a line that says "South Pole". And the font was cleaned up a bit. And there's an ad for DVD Translations in the title. And that's it.

No more comments. :P

Directions:

Anticipation is a one to four player game, with the pieces being high heels, a bugle, a teddy bear, and an ice cream cone. Choose the number of players, and computer players. Select your skill level and you start. You'll be on a board. There will be four different colors you can land on: yellow, green, blue, and pink. When you land on a spot, you get taken to a new area. A picture is drawn on this area, and when it is done, you have to spell out the name of the whatever the picture is of (if it is a picture of a rabbit, you spell out rabbit). In the upper right hand corner, a die will slowly move from six to zero. If you don't attempt to answer before it hits zero, you get another card. Otherwise, it will be on a number while you solve the puzzle. Remember this number because...

This game is HARD! First the computer can move in battle a lot faster and shoot more often. If you are the dark side it is even harder, because no matter what you have only one hit. The light side always wins. This game is completely one sided until you play 2 player where both have the same speed and health. Play this game if you like being annoyed or if you love to annoy others. It may be hard, but it's a blast!

Directions:

Start out the game by choosing if you will be on light or dark side (Kind Of Reminds You Of Star Wars) and decide who goes first. From there it is set up much like a chess board, but with unique pieces on each side such as knights and goblins , archers and manticores, and wizard and sorceress. Each having their own powers. Each can move their designated spaces, for example Ground 3 or Fly 3, and so on. After 2 pieces come into contact they are in battle, where the winning piece comes out and the losing does not. First to clear the board wins.*

Combat Colors
- When entering combat, the player whose color matches the color of the tile on which the battle is joined, will have an advantage in health.

Didn't that player just floor an opposing player with a well telegraphed right hook?...And what about that guy over there?...Isn't he pulling down his opponent's shorts? This isn't just basketball. It's basketbrawl. Sure, you need to show off your basic B-ball skills as well...but this game is far more challenging and exciting than just that. So come on, lace up...grab a ball...and hit the court with tyrone, Vinnie and the rest of the ARCH RIVALS.

--From the NES Arch Rivals instruction manual.

Overview:

It's a game between Los Angeles and Chicago, two of the greatest rival basketball teams ever to play. For some reason, there is no such thing as fouls. The players smack each other silly to steal the ball and score.

Now, remember when you said that "Video games are never what they used to be?" Well, guess what! This game denies that saying. It promotes silly violence that can be taken the wrong way. But if you like basketball where you can punch your opponent in the head without the ref pulling anything on ya, hit "Play Now" and start the game.

Directions:

You're playing a game of basketball. Pretty simple. The rules are: there are no rules. The person with the most points at the end is the victor.

Controls:

A Button: Punch, Pass the ball
B Button: Shoot the ball, command your teammate to shoot
Start Button: Choose number of players and choose team
Select Button: Toggle 1 or 2

Argus is a standard vertical shooting game like Raptor or Tyrian; this game bears a strong resemblance to Terra Cresta, an arcade game. There is no story, this game is a straight arcade-action shooter.

The game scrolls upward as waves of enemies attempt to impede your progress, shooting slow and fast moving bullets at your ship. Armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, blast your way forward while looking for bonuses. Crudely drawn buildings must be shot or avoided since it is possible to crash into them. While moving forward the game allows your ship to move as far left or right as necessary. Finally, at the end of each level you will have to destroy a large enemy.

Revenge of Doh is a direct sequel to the original arcade smash Arkanoid. Along with improved graphic engine, better sound and music, better hardware support and more levels, Revenge of Doh also features a built-in editor and allows you to create your own level sets!

Revenge of Doh continues Arkanoid's plot as follows, directly taken (including typoes) from the game:

A long time period passed and the dimension controlling force Doh has again come back to life. Occupying the huge starship Xorg, it has entered our universe from a different dimension. Mixtec, Arkanoid type spaceship, has lauched the craft Vaus II to make a preemptive attack on Xorg.

The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lazers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

You play a cute little elf named Christine who is trying to retrieve Arkista's ring. You must battle one hundred twenty five levels of mazes and enemies to reach your goal. If you get to the end, you are allowed to start over with faster, harder enemies. Be sure to collect as many magic items as you can, such as the cure potions and the wand that lets you shoot fire balls.

Controls:

A Button: Fire arrows, Use Item
B Button: Pause, Select item from Inventory
Start Button: Same as B
Select Button: Status Screen (between levels)

Hints:

Full health
- Simply walk into an altar (one of the little squares with a cross on it) to have your health restored. Note that it only works once per altar, so save it until you need it.

    <desc>Obviously, this is the game that Ultraman Ball for Gameboy totally ripped off. The whole time I was playing Armadillo, I was thinking "God damn, this is exactly like Ultraman Ball." It was that similar. Aside from the stupid overworld map, anyways. So you're an armadillo, I guess, and you can roll into an indestructible ball. An indestructible ball that can jump. You can stay in a ball the whole time, but you won't get very far. I mean, how else are you going to climb ladders? And you jump higher when you're normal. Also, you can slide down ledges, which helps you reach high ledges (just like Mega Man X, and, yes, Ultraman Ball). So yeah, it'd be pretty cool if there wasn't some serious slowdown, throughout the entire game. Sigh.

Translation Description:

The game is 100% done, except for a couple of messages that are apparently unused. There's a small freezing bug near the end that seems to happen at random, so keep your savestates handy!

According to the readme the intro screen had a few errors in version 1.0, and these have been fixed in 1.01.

    <desc>If you didn't know, Villgust is a somewhat popular anime series in Japan. I have had the pleasure of seeing the two-episode OAV, thanks to Taskforce, and it's really really good. When I first started playing the game, I was determined to at least get to Fanna. Mmmm.. Yummy Fanna.. Hmmmmm.... ... Oh! Well I never got to Fanna, because I got stuck in the first section! It's very sad. I played for at least a couple days before giving up and writing this review based on what little information I have. Basically it's just a typical RPG. The cool thing is that the battles are side-scrolling, making it a little more involving. It's pretty fun, actually. The control really sucks though, almost as bad as, say, an Action 52 game (okay, not quite that bad..), and it's more than a little annoying at times. If you don't mind stuff like that, then by all means try this out! Apparently there's a FAQ somewhere that'll help you actually get further in the game, so have fun.

Translation Description:

The translation is very very good. No, it really is. It's very nice.

One small Gaulish village continues to defy the occupying forces, the villagers protected by a magic potion which makes them invincible. But now Obelix has vanished! The Romans have confirmed his capture and taken him to an unknown destination.

Ast?rix is a platform game based on the eponymous comic books, where the short and mustached Gaul has to progress through levels located all across Europe, fighting Romans and various aggressive animals along the way, to rescue his friend Obelix before Caesar throws him to the lions....

    <desc>This game is something of a mix between Rad Racer and Battle Cars on the SNES. You drive around in this silver car that can change shape and become thinner, (A pretty useless feature, as you can't shoot in this mode) shooting missiles at cars that get in the way, all while trying to not run out of fuel. The problem is, the tracks are REALLY long, you only have a finite amount of missiles (You can buy some though by trading points at stores that pop up now and then, and other items of interest), and if you run out while fighting one of the bosses, you're screwed into having to start the entire track over. Which is really bad considering that means you have to listen to the music again. Seriously, the music in this game is easily some of the worst I've heard on the NES. It sounds like a couple of retarded circus monkeys on crack got a hold of a cheap ass Casio keyboard and had an hour long jam session. But wait, there's hope! If you read the readme (and you always read them, don't you?), you'll find out that if you hit select while playing the game, you can turn it off! Despite all the flaws and horrendously cheap scenarios in the game (Dont' even get me started on the cheap ass spaceship(?) fight that happens after you kill a boss.), I really like this game, enough to where I didn't stop playing until I beat it. Give this game a try if you can't get enough Rad Racer/Chase HQ type of games, and don't mind constantly saving and reloading save states.

Translation Description:

It's really hard to find stuff to say about complete translations. Um, it's all in english. Have fun. Use a clean, original Japanese rom. Um, have fun.

    <desc>This is the world's first Astyanax level hack, This hack was being worked on and off for almost 2 years. You'll notice that the levels and text has been changed, and there's also some minor graphics changes.

People who'll remember this game can tell you that the gameplay is similar to Legendary Axe on the TG-16. And people'll also enjoyed the original game will get get their Astyanax fix. :p

Well, I hope you all enjoy playing this hack as much as I had fun making it. :)

Astyanax is a side-scroller with some pretty good graphics. I like the choice of color, and the sprites are well defined. The controls leave a little something to be desired, they don't respond well. The sound was pretty decent. It did have some high pitched sounds, but it wasn't too aggravating.

The story was OK except for the fact that there is no explanation for Princess Rosebud picking Astyanax to rescue her. The story I read said that he needed to save her because she is the only one that can send him home, but what if he doesn't want to go home? What if he's a nerd at home, but here he's a great warrior? Why did Rosebud choose Astyanax? Is it the fact that he has one of the most difficult names to pronounce in the whole school? Maybe you find that out after beating it....

Directions:

Astyanax's quest will take him through 11 worlds. Throughout each world he will face a lot of monsters. At the end of each world, he will face a mini-boss. Defeat it to complete the world. 

Astyanax attacks with his magic axe. When using the axe, you can make more powerful attacks by letting your power meter build up between swings. He can also use one of the three magic spells given to him by Cutie. The spells are Bind, Blast and Bolt. Bind will freeze all enemies for a short time. Blast shoots a fireball in all directions. Bolt will strike all enemies down with a bolt of lightening. To change spells, press start, and then press up to toggle between them. Use the spell selected by pressing up and attack.

Power-up items are hidden inside magic statues. Destroy the statue to get the power-up inside. The power claw will increase your axe power, allowing you to make stronger attacks with it. The mini axe will change your weapon from axe to swift spear, and if you get another one it will change it to a mighty sword. A red potion will give you three hit points back, while a blue one will restore them all. Wings will make your attacks faster. You will also find a fairy when you get low on magic, she will either give you magic points back, or upgrade your weapon. If you find a doll of Astyanax, it will be good for a one-up. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Pause, Switch spells

Hints:

Invincibility
- At the Astyanax title screen, hit Up four times, then Down, Left, Right, and Up on Controller 1. If you did this right, Astyanax can not take any physical damage. He can still be affected by the enemies' magic spells, though...

Stage Select
- At the Astyanax title screen, hit Up, Down, Left, Right, and B four times on controller 1. If you did this right, you'll see a stage select screen that lets you start at any level after the first one. He will also start out with a sword at full power.

Athena, a young girl, who is very talented with a sword, is bored one day. So she decides to go out and find herself an adventure. With all the ghouls and monsters around, Athena will probably get more than what she bargained for! However, she'll show that she's more than another face.

Directions:

This is your typical sidescroller.

In this game, you must fight your way through all the baddies, and they'll often drop different weapons, like hammers or swords or cool shields or armor pieces! And there's bosses, too, like so many other games! One little twist, though, you have a time limit!!!!

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Shows items

Hints:

Get Ultimate Weapons
- In the first level, look for the first small mushroom, get on top of it, and duck down. You'll get the ultimate sword, shield, helmet, and armor.

Athletic World was developed and published in Japan by Bandai in 1986 and was published in North America by Nintendo in 1987. Athletic World was the first of ten games Bandai released and/or developed for the Family Trainer series. The first editions of the game featured the Family Fun Fitness logo on the label, and also a mention of campatibility only with FFF accessory. Once Nintendo bought the rights to the Family Fun Fitness pad, they re-released Athletic World with an updated label, this time displaying compatibility with the Power Pad. The second edition of the game also featured a different box, making the original box a rare item for collectors.

The game simulated five different Olympic-style challenges  Hurdles, Hop A Log, Animal Trail, Rafting, and Dark Tunnel. Movements in the game are controlled by the player physically running, jumping, and stepping on the pad in a similar fashion to modern dance pad games. Each challenge is designed to train the player in a different manner. Hurdles tests the player on timing, while Dark Tunnel challenges the player's dexterity. This game also offers the unique feature of having players' game play experience tailored to them by asking for their Name, Age, Gender, and the current date to provide them with customized advice.

In "Atlantis no Nazo", you play a nameless archaeologist who must descend into the dangerous caverns of the lost continent Atlantis, and eventually find his way to the inner sanctum with the legendary treasure. The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.

This game was to be sent to the US as Super Pitfall II, but was cancelled.

    <desc>This game's a Space Harrier clone. It's not a -bad- Space Harrier clone, but it's not a particularly good one either. The music is kinda catchy, the graphics are decent - especially the fact that your little heroine character will change outfits if the level you're playing warrants it, which is quite a nice touch - but the fact of the matter is that she moves just a liiiiiittle too slowly, you can only fire two or three shots at a time, and the screen is usually filled with so much stuff that it's almost impossible to survive. I beat the game by savestating through it, but that gigantic panda-thing with the huge eyes and submachinegun still gives me nightmares... okay, maybe not, but still! I'm going to say, "Try it, you might like it! And if you don't, it builds character." and leave this review at that.

Translation Description:

This patch translates the title screen. Not that there was anything else that needed it, but it does a good job of what it does!

Explore the streets of San Zucchini, and try to stop the ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES.

Hop hop hop... fall in sewage. The loose controls on this game make simple navigation an annoying chore. Use save states liberally. We won't tell!

Directions:

Controls:

A Button: Jump

Gameplay: 1/10

Where to start? The two enemies are vicious and badly designed. They randomly go about on the board and once in a while decide to hunt you down for a short while. It is often impossible to avoid them, too. The puzzle solution is only shown to you for a millisecond and might give you an idea of how it looks like, but still make it extremely frustrating to know where certain pieces go. Having a solution handy on the other hand, will make the puzzle part redundant and the entire game consists of avoiding those annoying enemies. These two gameplays do not work well together. The worst has to be the snow dragon puzzle, where half of the pieces look the same. Some puzzles are actually made that it is very easy to see how they belong together. Puzzles are nice, but it is frustrating to have to piece this together while you are hunted and on a time limit. Luckily there is a pause mode which lets you see all the tiles and get some strategy into your mind.

Then there are only seven puzzles, if you happen to not give up during the first round. There could be more puzzles with the same characters. Why design different ones for the stages if don't make the useful? And once in a while I thought there might be some theme going with matching characters to the current picture, but then it turns out to be another idea that went forgotten towards the end, when you piece together a naked girl.

Scoring also makes no sense, you do get a score at the end up the game does not keep any high scores, and does not even show it to you at the end.

Graphics: 5/10

Easily the best the game has to offer. The characters is kind of cute and the visual interface is also acceptable. Some puzzles do look nice and some unexpected nudie pictures made me smile, thinking Sachen did it again with their naughty stuff from out of nowhere. However, these pictures are very good looking compared to some earlier stuff like in Honey Peach.

Sound: 1/10

Extremely annoying. Mute that TV straight away as otherwise you will just get a headache within minutes. And if the music is not bad enough you have the horrid beeping if you have been touched by an enemy. Sound is different on the various puzzles, but similarly annoying as well.

Overall: 2/10

Really horrible, stay away from this one. And if you do not listen to this advice then you will notice it yourself as soon as that first round starts up. I would be surprised if you play more than the first puzzle. It is only seven rounds to this does not even make it worth getting. The decent graphics alone can't save this. It's a real shame, just make it a normal puzzle game, be it sliding or what you do now without the silly enemies and we might be enjoying this some more.

The ultimate test in marksmanship challenges you to save Boomer from the world's perils. A seemingly endless chase kicks you into a shooting frenzy to save BABY BOOMER. Contrasting worlds of terrifying critters and countless surprises in a backdrop of cliffs, canyons and caves keeps you at the edge of your seat. Get ready to shift into high gear as BOOMER leads you from the GOLDEN PARK to the GRUESOME CEMETARY. Take your pick of escorting BOOMER up to the REGION OF HEAVENLY CLOUDS or down to the EVIL CAVERNS. From there on, panic sets in as you follow BOOMER through the CRYPTS, the MINE SHAFT and the WATERWORKS WORLDS (if you can find them). Discovering secrets and tricks is part of the fun and gives you an edge over other players. Only with steady hands, split second reflexes and a little luck can you overcome an overwhelming variety of enemies and obstacles. A surprise ending awaits those accomplished few who can complete the game.

    <desc>
Back to the Future was a big hit in the theaters when it came out. Because of that, they made a few video games based on it. This is a typical example of a video game that was based on a movie. Almost every hit movie in the 80's was turned into a video game. Usually the video game was bad, though. The problem was that America bought the game expecting it to be at least a little bit like the movie, and it wasn't.

This one is no different: funny movies that are a joy to watch, and crappy video game counterparts. The graphics were flat, the music and sounds were annoying, and the controls slow. It's a hard game to play because the controls were so slow that you would fall off cliffs because you didn't let go of the d-pad soon enough. The only thing that was good about the game was the story. I already knew I liked that though, because I had seen the movies.

Directions:

Back to the Future 2 revolves around three main time periods: 1955, 1985, and 2015. Each of these years contains fifteen streets to explore. Throughout the game, there are two main things you must find: Object Rooms and Puzzle Rooms.

You can also find Bonus Rooms for a fun... umm... bonus... but these are not necessary.

There are several items of interest. The compass will tell you what year you're in, what street you're on, and what sector of that street you're in. There are food items to collect that will yield an extra man after 100 points. Pizza gives you 10 points, and soda bottles will give you 1 point. Fuel is needed to travel time. It is represented by a radioactive symbol. Keys will be needed to open rooms. A star will give you the ability to shoot a bouncing weapon that will only last as long as your life does. Lives are easy to lose since you only get one hit point, but at least you start off with 8 lives. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Fire Weapon
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Switch between Status and Object Panel

Hints:

Start at Part 3
- At the title screen, hold B + Select then enter the password FLUXCAPACITORISTHEPOWER.

Poor Marty McFly. He's not having a very good day. First his friend Professor Emmett Brown is shot by a bunch of gun-toting crazies, all because he cheated them out of a little plutonium. Then Marty was just barely able to escape in the Prof's new sports car turned time machine.

The problem is that this time machine propelled him back to the year 1955. To make matters worse, Marty managed to interfere with George McFly and Lorraine Baine's first meeting, they are the 50's teenagers that will some day be his parents. Because of Marty, they do not meet as before, which means that they won't fall in love, get married and raise a family. That means Marty will never be born.

Marty has only one hope and that is you! Somehow you have to help him undo the damage he did when he first arrived in the past. You both have to make sure that history repeats itself and his parents fall in love at the big dance. Keep in mind though, that Marty has made lots of enemies among the local bullies. So getting from place to place is going to be a real challenge. And time is definitely not on your side.

--From the NES Back to the Future instruction manual.

Gameplay:

In the single mode game, the player controls Marty McFly through various stages set in 1955 in which he collects various clock icons in order to advance to the next level, and avoid the gradual vanishing of his future (indicated by a fading photograph at the bottom of the screen.) If the photograph fades fully, Marty would lose a life as it would show him vanishing. Collecting 100 clocks restored the photograph to its full, unfaded status. Two power-ups can help improve Marty's control: bowling balls that can destroy enemies and a skateboard which can speed up gameplay. There are also three minigames at the end of each stage, featuring such scenarios as Marty repelling Biff Tannen's gang of bullies from a cafe, blocking all the kisses Lorraine sends Marty (in the shape of little hearts), and having to position his guitar properly to stay in tune at the dance in order for George and Lorraine to kiss. The gameplay on these stages is often compared to that of Paperboy.

In the final stage, Marty gets to control the DeLorean time machine on the street at night, dodging lightning bolts and obstacles while accelerating in such a way as to reach 88 miles per hour precisely at the end of the stage, enabling the time machine to bring Marty home to 1985.

If Marty loses all his lives, there would be a losing screen shot which reads "Tough luck Marty! It looks like you are stuck here". The player would also be shown that screen shot if Marty failed to get the DeLorean to 88 mph by the time he reached the wires, regardless of how many lives he had left.

The President--Kidnapped?! But the really bad news is that the Dragon Ninja is responsible--and you alone can rescue President from his clutches. The Dragon Ninja has a helicopter waiting to spirit the President away. If he makes his getaway before you can stop him, the world will never see the President again. The Dragon Ninja will be ready for you. You can expect to face--at the very least--wave after wave of ninja henchmen, samurai, and super warriors as you make your way through city and forest, atop moving big rigs and freight trains.

Remember--the nation is counting on you!

--From the NES Bad Dudes instruction manual.

Directions:

Fight your way through all seven levels and bosses to rescue the president. You can choose Blade or Striker to fight with, both play exactly the same, they just look different. Three different kinds of items you will need: Cola refills 5 bars of your life, the clock adds on 5 seconds to your time, and weapons. The Dagger and the Nunchucks are powerful weapons that will kill ordinary ninjas in one hit. You carry them around with you until you die, and you can even take them between levels. Both do the same damage, they just look different.

Controls:

A Button: Punch/Kick
B Button: Jump
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Skip mission briefing

Hints:

63 Extra Lives!
- (At Title Screen) On controller 2, hold B and A, then tap up, down, up, down. Press start on the first controller.

Bad News Baseball has made-up players and teams. Note that this game has both a "boys mode" and a "girls mode", though you can hardly tell the difference (you can see the hair is a bit longer in girls mode). As the manual states " Unfortunately, in this mode, the zoom-up display shows only boy players. Sorry for letting you down.". You have to be a contortionist to get this mode, too.

Easter Eggs:

The official code of Digital Press staffers: play with an all female team! To change all the rosters to girls' teams, hold Down/Left on controller 1 and Up on controller two, then hit Reset. The cursor at the main menu will change from a baseball into a heart.

Take to the streets as Duke Davis, martial arts vigilante. All manner of thugs, crooks, circus escapees, athletes with attitudes, and even vicious animals, have made the streets of your home town unsafe. Your fists and feet are the community's only hope to live in peace once again!

Directions:

Bad Street Brawler turns out to be a bit more interesting than it looks at first glance. You start out thinking that you just have three moves which are pretty dull, and the whole game is gonna be about wading through the baddies using the same boring punch and kick and ear-pull thing. But here's the hook: your guy actually has 15 different 'Force Moves' in his martial arts arsenal, but he can only use three at a time each round. Unfortunately the three moves are chosen for you at each stage, but on the plus side you get a practice session with a punching bag before each round begins. So, that lets you get used to the moves you'll have available in the next fight.

All your enemies in Bad Street Brawler are some kind of weird. Mostly circus freaks. No offense to any circus freaks out there, we know you're not all bad folks. Anyway, the ones with weapons sometimes drop them, and you can pick them up. No, don't think you're gonna go all Double Dragon and use their weapons against them. You might get some vitality back from picking them up, and at the end of the stage you get extra points for throwing them in the garbage. Way to clean up the streets! 

Controls:

A Button: 1st 'Force Move'
B Button: 2nd 'Force Move'
A and B: 3rd 'Force Move'
Up: Jump
Start Button: Start, Pause

Hints:

Don't Fight Every Fight!
- Bad Street Brawler is another of those games with a time limit, so you can't expect to win if you stop to dispatch every midget, X-Games contestant, or cracked-out animal you meet. Also Duke Davis is the sort of person who wears bright yellow diapers and high heeled boots. So you probably guessed that you should walk on by and avoid confrontation when possible.

Ballblazer is a one-on-one soccer match set in the future. You control a robot and try to snare a floating ball called a Plasmorb, which could then be fired or carried into the opponent's goal. You play on a simple 3d playfield which is split in half. You can play against the computer or against another robot controlled by a human player.

I loved this game as a child. I guess I still do. I always preferred the battle mode of the game. My brother and I would play Balloon Fight at least once a day. The arcade mode is pretty fun too. The only thing I didn't really like about it was the fact that you can't beat the game. There was also a mode called Balloon Trip. This mode was very difficult. I don't think there was a way to beat this mode either. It was all about how many points you can get.

This game had excellent gameplay and sound. The graphics weren't awesome but they were good, especially considering the game was published by Nintendo. On the whole I'd say Balloon Fight was a great game.

Directions:

In battle mode, the object is to pop your enemies' balloons before they pop yours. To pop their balloon, you just need to touch it with your feet. So, it is best to always have a little more altitude than the enemy.

You can either tap the A button to flap your hands and gain altitude, or you can hold the B button. I prefer to hold the button, rather than tapping it.

Be sure to grab bubbles that float up from the water for extra points. Watch out for lightning from the clouds, and the shark that lives in the water. The balloon trip mode is just an obstacle course you have to fly through without touching any of the stars.

Point Guide:

You get different points depending on what enemy you've hit and when you hit it.

Floating: Pink-500 Green-750 Yellow-1000

Standing: Pink-750 Green-1,000 Yellow-1,500

Parachute Open: Pink-1,000 Green-1,500 Yellow-2,000 

Controls:

A Button: Fly a little, good for precision
B Button: Hold to fly fast
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select game mode

Hints:

Get More Points in 2 Player Mode
- When you enter the bonus stage, you cannot lose a life, so work with your partner to pop each other's balloons for the 1,000 point bonus without worrying about losing a life. After the bonus stage you will both be restored to two balloons, no matter how you were at the end.

One Balloon Worries
- If you end up with one balloon, you will bounce farther than normal and it will be harder to control, but you can fly through gaps a little easier. Hold out until a bonus stage and you will be fine!

This is a really weird game. I can't describe it very well, which is why I kind of wish someone else would do these review things. But this is a platform game, and you're a Banana Prince, and you walk around and attack things with your incredibly small axe. You can also push Down+B and make a vine appear, that you can climb, in order to jump higher and stuff. When you jump off the vine, you can also hit enemies, Sonic-style! Yeah, wow!

You can use the incredible multitude of rings you collect to purchase new weapons, or you can go to the bizarre minigame island, where you answer questions and stuff, to some unknown end. It's pretty cool.

Translation Description:

Everything's complete, although this script really could've used an edit. Some of the things people say make absolutely no sense, and some of it is outright contradictory. It makes for a very silly game.

Don't forget to use this patch on a German ROM. Patching the Japanese ROM will make for a game that is not English. To say the least.

In this puzzle game, you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you.

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.

Pebble Beach is a golf course right on California's pristine Pacific Coast. The land is a nice piece of real estate. Your goal is to play the best round of golf you can.

Directions:

This is a golf game with real world physics, as well as the rules of golf apply to this game. Wind will affect the direction of the ball when it is hit, hitting the ball out of sand traps will be more difficult than hitting the ball from the fairway, and most importantly, the slope of the greens will make a putted ball roll off course. If the player believes that these factors will not affect the way the game is played, then the player's score will reflect that notion.

Controls:

A Button: Revert to the SHOT, COURSE, SCORE screen
B Button: Go to SHOT Strength screen
Start Button: Not used during the SHOT screen
Select Button: Not used during the SHOT screen
Left and Right: Changes the desired flight path of the ball
Up and Down: Changes the club to be used for the shot

Hints:

Slice and Hook
- Remember that if you stop the meter early it will slice the ball and if you stop it late it will hook the ball.

In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu. The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler. You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.

Trivia:

Based on the book "Shui Hu Zhuan", a novel based on actual 12th century Chinese political conflicts.

Sick of all those games with war and fighting? Why not join the Barbster in a magical dream quest?

Gameplay:

Unlike other Barbie games, Barbie is designed as a platformer. Barbie's levels are "dreams" and each "dream" has Barbie walking left to right while avoiding obstacles or else her "Zs" will drop and she will have to replay the level, or sometimes restart the entire game.

Barbie can also request help from animals by pressing SELECT to choose what sort of thing the animal should do and B to throw the command, if the command reaches the animal, the animal will do the command requested.

Sometimes "Bosses" will appear, these "Bosses" are usually defeatable with the help of an animal.

    <name>The Bard's Tale: Tales of the Unknown</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
The Bard's Tale is a very good round based rpg. It's a very long game and it has a lot of detail. The graphics aren't great, but they are good. The sounds are also pleasant without too many beeps or white noise. The controls were easy to learn because it's all menus to thumb through. The story was pretty interesting and had enough detail to seem real. A good storyline is essential to make a good RPG. With upgradeable characters and countless items to find, this game has hours of roleplaying enjoyment to offer.

Directions:

The Bard's Tale is a straightforward "dungeon crawl". The objective is to gain experience and advance characters' skills through (mostly) random combat with enemies and monsters. This is done while exploring maze-like dungeons, solving occasional puzzles and riddles, and finding or buying better weapons and armor.

Combat is round-based and abstract, described in text rather than shown graphically; there is no notion of moving characters around on a map during combat. The second and third games of the series do have a concept of distance between the player's party and its enemies, so that close-range weapons are not usable until the distance has been suitably reduced; however the only movement available to the party is an abstract "advancing". Cash and experience points are distributed evenly to all surviving party members after a particular encounter is won.

When beginning the game, the player may create up to six player characters, chosen from among the following classes: bard, hunter, monk, paladin, rogue, warrior, magician, and conjurer. The classes sorcerer and wizard were available to experienced conjurers and magicians. A typical well-balanced party might consist of a couple of fighters, a rogue, a bard, and a couple of magic users.

The most important character was arguably the bard, whose magical songs functioned like long-lasting spells and affected the player's party in various wayssuch as strengthening their armour, or increasing their attack speed, much like "buffs" in modern day MMORPGs. A number of obligatory puzzles in the game were unsolvable without the use of bard songs. Each bard song triggered corresponding music while he played (some classical, some original).

With only a map of the town of Skara Brae included on the box, it was usually necessary for players to use pencil and graph paper to make their own maps as they played through the game.

Magic users were allowed to change classes permanently. The game manual describes a magic user who has mastered all spells from all four classes as "an Archmage, the most powerful being in the world of The Bard's Tale." However, Archmage status had no effect on gameplay other than simply having all spells available.

Casting one of the 85 magic user spells consisted of typing a four-letter code found only in the printed game manual, which perhaps helped limit piracy and contributed to the commercial success of the game

Pull out the Zapper Light Gun, and blast a variety of objects in Barker Bill's Trick Shooting. The game starts out simple enough; shoot rising balloons while avoiding the happy-go-lucky dog. As you get through each stage, the challenges become more difficult. Each level offers a new challenge, including Balloon Saloon, Flying Saucers, Window Pains (pun or translation error?) and Fun Follies.

Player, manager, owner... You can do it all in Baseball Stars! Make your own team and leagues; hire, fire, and trade players; develop your players from inexperienced rookies into veteran pitchers and hitters. Play against a friend or the computer - you'll never have to worry about being rained out again!

--From the NES Baseball Stars instruction manual.

Gameplay:

Simple graphics are coupled with repetitive upbeat 8-bit music. The pitching is simple: curve balls, fast balls, off speed pitches, and sinkers. The batting is a swing on a level plane, thus it is simply a question of timing. The fielding, at the time, was a revolution in arcade baseball; it achieved a level of realism unseen prior to its release. This realism, coupled with ease-of-fielding features contributed to the game's popularity. These ease-of-fielding features are characterized by examples such as: off-screen fielders automatically drifting towards fly balls, fielders catching balls anywhere near them, the ability to jump and dive, infielders shifting to prevent extra base hits down the line when men are on base, etc.

Seasons and vs.:

Baseball Stars includes a simple one-off versus mode, but it provides the option of creating a mini-league of up to six teams, with each team playing up to 25 games against every other team. That means a season with a maximum 125 game schedule can be created. When making a season, one chooses how many teams, how many games, and which teams are controlled by the AI (computer) and which are controlled by the gamers. In vs. mode no stats, such as wins, losses, hits, or home runs are kept but money can still be won when a player controlled team plays against an AI controlled team. No money is won in this mode when it is player vs. player. Versus mode games can be considered exhibition games.

Teams:

There can be a total of 14 teams. Eight teams come with the game and six more teams can be created. The original eight cannot in any way be edited or changed.

Although the game does not use any real Major League Baseball teams, one of the default teams, the American Dreams, included players with names that are based on real (former) baseball players such as "Pete" (Pete Rose), "Hank" (Hank Aaron), "Babe" (Babe Ruth), "Sandie" (Sandy Koufax), "Cy" (Cy Young), "Denny" (Denny McLain), and "Willie" (Willie Mays). In addition, the Japan Robins included a player named "Oh," presumably after Sadaharu Oh of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.

The other default teams are the Ninja BlackSox, Brave Warriors, Japan Robins, World Powers, Ghastly Monsters, Lovely Ladies (an all-women's team), and SNK Crushers.

When creating a new team, one is given the option of choosing its main strength (for example: defense, running, batting, balanced, etc). This does not mean that a chosen strength will remain with the team forever. The option simply favors the chosen attribute when the computer randomly generates the players. Each new teams gets about $30,000 to start and 18 players (5 pitchers, 8 batters, and 5 pinch hitters). From there, games are played and games that are won earn money for the team. Players on created teams can be modified and improved as well as traded amongst other created teams. It must be noted, though, that a pitcher cannot be traded for a batter; it must always be batter for batter or pitcher for pitcher. There is also a free agent market in which players can be bought ranging in price from $5,000 to $2,980,000. Since there is a limit of 18 players per team, before a free agent can be bought, a player must be fired.

Statistics:

In season play, the game conveniently keeps track of various stats. By going into the SEE STANDINGS menu, it can be seen how each team fares compared to each other team, each teams' win/loss records, top ten batting averages, top ten home run batters, top ten RBI hitters, top ten ERA pitchers, top ten winning pitchers, and top ten save leaders.

Each individual player's batting average and home run totals can be seen when that player is up to bat and individual pitcher's ERA is shown when that pitcher is pitching. With the exception of a pitcher's ERA, stats are current when a player steps into the batter's box.

Mercy Rules:

The game has a 10-run mercy rule. Thus, if at the end of any inning, one team is up by a total of 10 runs, the game is called in favor of the leading team. In addition to the 10-run mercy rule, there is also a 100-run mercy rule. If at any point in the game one team attains a lead of 100 or more, play is immediately stopped and a winner is declared, even though the inning is not over. For example, if the visiting team scores 100 runs in the top of the first inning, the visiting team will be declared the winner and the home team will not even have the chance to bat. If the game remains tied after 18 innings, the game is over and no winner is declared; all hits and other stats are not saved - as if the game never happened.

Baseball is a game where you can pitch, hit, field, and run just like in a real baseball game. You can choose between USA and Japan modes, two different teams, and among a line-up of unique players. In the 1-player game, you play against the computer, and the in the 2-player game, your friend is your opponent.

Gameplay:

Despite its simplistic graphics, Baseball had fairly sophisticated control of pitching and batting. Though entirely 2-D, the system of curving and varying the speed of the ball allowed for a handful of tricky pitches, and too many fastballs will wear out the pitcher's arm. For such an early game, the success with which it exhibited intuitive controls is outstanding. In Batting, for example, the player can vary where in the box the batter is standing simply by using the arrows before the pitch, and stopping the swing early attempts a bunt. Timing (and the placement of the ball) determines the path of the ball in a logical, and even consistent way. The fielding aspects of the game are less impressive, with the player only controlling the actions of the outfielders after they've stumbled along to retrieve it. The infielders have slightly better instincts, and it is a challenge to steal a base against a pitcher who can see the whole field. Overall, the skill most crucial in the game is making the right decisions, rather than mastering a complex control scheme.

Playball -- like you've never played it before! Ryne Sandberg Plays Bases Loaded 3 not only offers you the great graphics, sound and gameplay you've come to expect of Jaleco's Bases Loaded series of games, but also adds the most demanding baseball challenge possible -- to play the perfect game!

Sure, we've also changed the fielding perspective to a centerfield camera point of view to make fielding more realistic. And we've made fielders much larger than they have been in any other Bases Loaded games. We've also added an EDIT team so that you can alter the statistics of the players. And yes, we've added the choice of three ballparks, each with unique characteristics. And of course you can make diving stops and leaping grabs, throw curves and changeups, make lineup changes, bunt, steal bases, and everything else you expect from a great baseball game. But the biggest difference in Bases Loaded 3 is the challenge it makes to you -- can you play a perfect game?

With Bases Loaded 3, winning the game is only part of the challenge of a one-player game against the computer. You won't beat Bases Loaded 3 unless you play a perfect game against the toughest team we can throw at you. And in two-player head-to-head games, expect nothing less than exhilaration! If you're anything like those of us at Jaleco who have played the game together, you'll scream at your player for making a bad throw, you'll taunt your opponent with biting sarcasm when his baserunner gets caught off third base, and you'll laugh together when your opponent scores seven runs in the bottom of the ninth to tie the game 15-15. We're pretty sure you're going to have a good time with this game -- because we sure do!

--From the NES Bases Loaded 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

This installment of the vast Bases Loaded series is a pretty good one. It plays just like the first two. The gameplay is the same as it was, but the gameplay was great, so that's a good thing. They kept the controls the same so there wasn't a big transitional phase between the games.

The biggest difference is that this installment has much better graphics. The colors are better and so is the detail. The sounds are just as annoying if not more. You can turn the music off, but the sound effects are annoying too, so I suggest turning down the volume.

Directions:

Compete with your friends in baseball, or join the race for the pennant by yourself. Choose your team and play the best game of baseball you can.

When playing offense, you can swing the bat by pressing A. Watch the catcher's glove to see where the ball is headed, and press down while you swing if the ball goes low, and press up while you swing if the ball is going high. You can also press B to bunt, but you will still have to move the bat up or down to make sure you hit the ball. After you hit the ball you can press down and A at the same time to make your baserunner run. If you press down and B the runner will go back. Also if you press down and B while your batting and have a runner on base, the runner will try to steal.

When you play defense you can press A to pitch the ball, or B to try to pick off a runner that is on base. Pressing the D-pad before you throw it will move the pitcher on the mound. Pressing the D-pad while the pitcher is in his wind up will move the ball's path. Pressing up will add speed and pressing down will make it slower. While fielding the ball, you can throw to the different bases by pressing the d-pad while throwing the ball. Left will throw it to first, up will throw it home, left will throw it to first, and down will throw it to second. Pressing both buttons at the same time when the ball tries to go by a fielder will make that fielder slide or jump for the ball. At any time during the game you can press start to call timeout and make substitutions.

In this installment they added the ability to make your own teams by editing the teams offered by the game. You can also edit the stats of the players. You can make super men that never get tired, or make them really weak. There are three different ballparks, Chicago, L.A., and N.Y. Each one has it's own dimensions, making it a little easier or harder to hit home-runs. 

Controls:

Start Button: Pause/ Timeout
Offense
A Button: Swing, Run
B Button: Bunt, Return
Defense

Hints:

Selecting a Pitcher
- When selecting a pitcher remember that the lower a pitcher's E.R.A., the better he is.

Like its predecessor, Bases Loaded II offers both a single-game mode and a single- player "pennant race" mode. In the "pennant race", a player must first achieve at least a 75-55 record during the regular season, then win a best-of-7 "World Series" against L.A. or N.Y. depending whether you have chosen a team from the Eastern or Western league respectively.

Though some characteristics remained the same between Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded II (e.g. the same fictitious 12-team league returns in this game, with new players. It is worth noting that all of the players on the Washington, D.C. team are named after famous politicians, while all of Los Angeles's players take their names from Hollywood luminaries. In addition, one of Hawaii's pitchers is named Ho.), there are several noteworthy changes. One new feature was the "biorhythm" concept; players in the game had "biorhythms" that could be monitored to ensure optimal performance. Bases Loaded II had a little faster play action then the original game, and the point of view once a ball was hit into play was also different. In Bases Loaded the view was from behind home plate, whereas in Bases Loaded II the view was either from the first-base line if the ball was hit to left field, or from the third-base line if the ball was hit into right field.

It's the top of the ninth and you're at bat in the seventh and final game of the World Series. Your team is ahead by one run - that's not a lot, since your opponent just scored three in the eighth!

You've battled back in every game - no one figured it would be this tough. Your best hitter is in a slump; but, the rookie has gotten a hot bat the past two games. The bottom of your line-up will face your opponent's ace reliever. They've got the momentum. But you've got the heart.

So, ready for what could be your last at-bat, you've got to pick your hitters carefully. Use your imagination. Catch your opponent off guard. Wait for the right pitch. Bunt. Steal. Play aggressively or don't play at all.

The inning you've been waiting for all season is finally here. Make the most of it. After 11 years of waiting, you're ready to wear that World Series' ring and bring home that trophy.

--From the NES Bases Loaded instruction manual.

Overview:

Bases Loaded is filled to the brim with eight bit fun. The graphics were good for the time. It was the first game to be in the perspective of the pitcher. Prior to this, baseball games were usually from the batter's perspective, or an overhead view of the whole field. It was also the first baseball game to make the batter have to decide to swing high or low. The attention to detail made this game worthwhile. You can make substitutions while batting or pitching. Definitely a good attempt at realism. The sounds were realistic, but the music was annoying.

Directions:

Compete with your friends in baseball, or join the race for the pennant by yourself. Choose your team and play the best game of baseball you can. When playing offense, you can swing the bat by pressing A.

Watch the catcher's glove to see where the ball is headed, and press down while you swing if the ball goes low, and press up while you swing if the ball is going high.

Pressing the D-pad while the pitcher is in his wind up will move the ball's path. Pressing up will add speed and pressing down will make it slower. While fielding the ball, you can throw to the different bases by pressing the d-pad while throwing the ball.

Batter up! Jaleco hits another one out of the ballpark with Bases Loaded 4... the ultimate experience for baseball fans who just want to get out there and play ball. We've included all the best features to create the greatest baseball game ever - you get lineup changes, realistic player stats, a centerfield perspective, easy-to-use controls, exhibition and regular season games, two-player mode, even a Super Series.

In Bases Loaded 4, you coach your team just like they do in the big leagues. Study your players' stats, then assemble a lineup that'll stop the opposition in their tracks! A simple black and white star system shows you how each player is doing at a glance. If a player's performance starts to lag, you can send in a replacement from the bench or the bullpen. Study the opposing teams' lineups, too, so you'll know what you're up against when you meet that ace pitcher in the bottom of the ninth!

The umpire decides when your players make an outstanding play or really blow it... and believe me, it affects how they play. You may not agree with the decision, but you can't argue with the ump - ask any big league coach! Because the computer keeps track of how your players are doing, you can throw yourself into the game - and we know you will. Whether you're pitching, fielding, batting, or stealing a base, just concentrate on winning and keep your eye on the ball... we'll take care of the rest!

--From the NES Bases Loaded 4 instruction manual.

Overview:

Bases Loaded 4 is yet another addition to the series. More of the same stuff, with a little bit better graphics. Jaleco made a good game that's a lot of fun and then rode it for all it was worth. This same recipe is a little bland after four games. It's a good game and fun to play, it's just the same old stuff. They could have added a home-run derby or something.

The only thing I noticed other than the graphics was the addition of little blips that let you know where your outfielders are while the ball is in the air. The sound is a little better. The music is the same, but you can turn it off, and the sound effects were more realistic.

Directions:

Compete with your friends in baseball, or join the race for the pennant by yourself. Choose your team and play the best game of baseball you can. 

When playing offense, you can swing the bat by pressing A. Watch the catcher's glove to see where the ball is headed, and press down while you swing if the ball goes low, and press up while you swing if the ball is going high. You can also press B to bunt, but you will still have to move the bat up or down to make sure you hit the ball. After you hit the ball you can press down and A at the same time to make your baserunner run. If you press down and B the runner will go back. Also if you press down and B while your batting and have a runner on base, the runner will try to steal.

When you play defense you can press A to pitch the ball, or B to try to pick off a runner that is on base. Pressing the D-pad before you throw it will move the pitcher on the mound. Pressing the D-pad while the pitcher is in his wind up will move the ball's path. Pressing up will add speed and pressing down will make it slower. While fielding the ball, you can throw to the different bases by pressing the d-pad while throwing the ball. Left will throw it to first, up will throw it home, left will throw it to first, and down will throw it to second. Pressing both buttons at the same time when the ball tries to go by a fielder will make that fielder slide or jump for the ball. At any time during the game you can press start to call timeout and make substitutions.

In this installment, they got rid of a couple features. The Edit Player Stats system was removed. This was a mistake in my opinion. It was a pretty neat feature. They also got rid of the different ballparks. You don't even get to choose the stadium, which was another thing that gave the player a better sense of control.

Start Button: Pause/ Timeout
Offense
A Button: Swing, Run
B Button: Bunt, Return
Defense

This game is Baseball of the future...except with weapons. This game is a Sport/Baseball game. It basically follows the rules of Baseball, but with a few important differences. It involves multiple weapons that you can upgrade. There are no referees in Basewars. Instead, when you get in a pickle you have to fight the baseman with whatever weapon you have.

There is a multiplayer feature where you can both play at the same time and not have to take turns. The robots don't really have uniforms but different color body paint. Don't worry, it's easy to tell which team is which.

The graphics are good for the time period, but the sound could have been better.

Directions:

There are two different game modes: Open mode and Pennant mode. Open mode is a quick play mode which puts you in a game right away. Pennant mode is a tournament mode where you play a series of games against five different teams.

There are four different types of robots on each team, with different abilities.

They are mcycles, cyborgs, tanks, and flybots. Mcycles are made for speed, but can't turn very well. Tanks are slow, but powerful. Cyborgs are average in all abilities. Finally flybots are the unique robots, they don't have legs but they can hover and attack rapidly.

The Best weapons on the game are the laser sword and the laser pistol, but there are other weapons you can buy, including iron gloves, fire guns, muramasa, hand guns, and engine upgrades. 

Controls:

A Button: Punch/Attack
B Button: Pitch/Swing bat
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Laser Weapons
- Go to Team Edit, then choose Team A or B. Now enter ''Terminator'' as your name.
- Team A will have laser guns. Team B will have laser swords.

This is the cancelled US prototype of Bio Senshi Dan, which is included in the translated section.  This game is easier and is different enough to warrant keeping though.  ~Rx

    <desc>This is a hack which aims to make the Batman for NES game much easier and beatable then it originally was. I found the original to be very fun, yet difficult to beat. With this hack it's much more possible to beat the game in one set of lives.

I edited most of the levels (including boss levels) to make them easier and have some alternate shortcuts to them rather than having to always progress through the levels on a set path. I also removed several traps and added platforms to help avoid them. Enemy health has also been adjusted to make them easier to defeat. Some bosses it is more noticable, especially the final 2 bosses where I felt the battles were too difficult. Joker takes only a few hits to defeat, as he does in the movie. I also increased the amount of weapon ammo you get from powerups and also the health given by health powerups.

The game was a sequel to the Batman video game that was based on the 1989 film, but was closer in its format to the comic book version of the famed Caped Crusader, specifically the 1970s incarnations of Batman.

Gameplay:

Each version of the game was essentially the same in storyline and format; however, the NES version boasted some of the best graphics ever seen on the 8-bit home console system. The story begins with the Joker escaping from an insane asylum, and through various henchmen, tries to send Gotham City into chaos. Batman must survive several side-scrolling levels with various tricky jumps, and defeat a multitude of enemies and bosses to ensure that Gotham is safe.

Batman is armed with a utility belt that allows him to collect various types of icons throughout the stages in order to shoot different types of baterangs and projectiles. The game's password feature also helped the game from becoming too difficult.

The music was composed by Naoki Kodaka, Hara Nobuyuki and Shinichi Seya

THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN...

At one time Gotham City lay covered with a shroud of fear. Grime filed every nook and cranny of the city as gang bosses grew fat and powerful. The ultimate leader was The Joker. The green-haired madman with the killer smile took over as no Mafia don ever had. Nothing stood between him and total control over Gotham City - except Batman.

The arrival of the Batman sparked a renaissance in Gotham City. As the citizens reclaimed the city, the Dark Knight served as her ever-vigilant protector.

Now, the city is preparing to celebrate the Christmas holiday. The annual tree lighting ceremony is set to take place in Gotham Plaza, with the lovely Ice Princess prepared to flip the switch after the Mayor gives his traditional speech.

The Mayor wants to keep the tone positive. He knows Gotham City is in unrest lately. There have been a constant stream of reports filtering in from Police Commissioner Gordon's office of high crime in the inner city.

The Mayor invites Max Shreck - one of the city's leading citizens - to say a few words to the crowd. As he does, there is a rumble of commotion from the rear of the crowd. A giant gift-wrapped box rolls into the plaza. Suddenly the Red Triangle Circus Gang erupts from the package. They begin terrorizing the citizens, spreading panic and fear. Reacting quickly, Gordon radios instructions to his headquarters: "What are you waiting for? Send the Bat-Signal!"

The signal reflects off the cloudy skies over Gotham City and is caught by sensors mounted atop Wayne Manor, located outside the city. These sensors turn special mirrors which bounce the signal into the study of young millionaire, Bruce Wayne. He rises, facing the window. Cast in the glow of the reflected Bat-Signal, Wayne's brow furrows. He steps aside into the darkness, and heads for the Batcave...

--From the NES Batman Returns instruction manual.

Overview:

Batman Returns is a platformer with plenty to offer. It has well-drawn backgrounds, and the animation of the sprites is quite accurate. The music was catchy and the sound effects helped the action along. Gameplay was easy to pick up and learn, and it was fun. The controls were pretty easy, with using your secondary weapon as the only tricky part. All you have to is press select and choose which one you want, and then press up and attack at the same time.

The ability to use the grappling hook was really fun feature. The storyline was also good. It sounded like a typical story right out of one of the comics books. This game is a very nice addition to the Batman series.

Directions:

This game is a side-scrolling platform game, in which you must fight and kill baddies in order to advance. There are six stages, at the end of which, you fight a boss. The different bosses listed in chronological order are: Tattooed Strongman, Catwoman, Swordsman and the Tattooed Strongman, the Organ Grinder, Penguin's Ducky, and Penguin. You get to use a whole load of items, too! Press A + B together to do a cape slash, but it will take away a bar of energy if you do! Useful items include: small hearts that give you 8 hitpoints, large hearts that give you 16 hitpoints, a life box that gives you one up, a batarang that gives you four batarangs, a test tube that takes half of Catwoman's life, a batdisc that gives you three discs, and coins that give you bonus points. You start off with all the weapons and max life you can get.

Controls:

A Button: Jump, Shoot disks while in Batmobile
B Button: Punch, Flying Kick (while in air)

The citizens of GOTHAM CITY are busy planning the city's 200th Anniversary Festival, but there is not much to celebrate. Crime and violence rule the city.

The only man who can free the city from THE JOKER'S evil clutches is the one and only - BATMAN!

With your help, the CAPED CRUSADER can defeat THE JOKER and save the good people of GOTHAM CITY. BATMAN is armed with special weapons and acrobatic strength. He must destroy 15 different types of enemies and 5 bosses, while traveling through 5 stages.

Finally, BATMAN comes face-to-face with THE JOKER! But who will prevail? It's up to you!

--From the NES Batman instruction manual.

Overview:

Batman is based loosely on the Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson movie. Batman is out to stop the Joker from terrorizing Gotham City. There are some cinema scenes between levels, that show the Batmobile driving around or confrontations with the Joker. The cut-scenes have nice graphics to look at. The in-game graphics are good, too.

There are some quotes from the movie included, and much of the scenery came right from the movie, too, such as the Axis Chemical Plant, and Batman's final showdown against the Joker in the clock tower. The sounds were also reminiscent of the movie.

The controls were a little tricky at first, but easy to use once you get used to them. The ability to make Batman jump off the walls was a really fun feature. This platformer based on the movie was definitely an exception to the rule that all games based on movies are crappy.

Directions:

Help Batman save Gotham City by fighting your way through five different levels of bad guys, with a boss at the end of each one. Bosses include the flying beetle man, a room of death to navigate (gauntlet), the electric claw man, duel blocks, the bat-demon, and of course, the Joker. Items you will need: blue boxes with a B on it that are worth 1000 points, blue boxes with a missile that are worth ten ammo, and hearts that are worth one hit point (you'll have eight total). You will be able to switch your weapon when you collect the first missile box by pressing start and toggling between your weapons. You won't ever be able to get more life or weapons, so what you see is what you get. Being able to jump off the walls is very important to finding your way through the levels. Jump into a wall, then as soon as you make contact with it, press jump again and Batman will jump off of it. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Unlimited Continues
- Press Up(2), Left, right, left, right, A+B at the tittle screen.

This was a pretty good chess game. Really it was a great idea that just couldn't be handled very well by eight-bit Nintendo. The idea was to make a chess game that animates a fight scene when one player takes the other player's piece. Well, the drawback was slow gameplay with mediocre graphics. The game plays a lot better if you play on the regular board with no animations or cut scenes.

Directions:

Same rules as chess: defeat your opponent by trapping his king into certain death. Use the cursor to click on the piece that you want to move, then click on the space that you want to move to. If the animation seems to slow you up too much, there is a two dimensional mode. You have to start the game, then hit select to access the options menu. That is also where you have to go to set up a two player game, difficulty level, etc.

Controls:

A Button: Deselect Piece
B Button: Select Piece
Start Button: Start Game
Select Button: Options Menu

Hints:

Strategy
- Be sure not to leave a piece where it can be taken unless it's guarded by another piece.

While it appears to have Battle City graphics, it mostly follows Warpman rules and thus people must treat it as a Warpman game in disguise or "floating tanks in outer space."

Destroy different enemy tanks, while trying to keep them away from your base. When you have destroyed 20 enemy tanks you advance to the next level with different layout. In each level there's some obstacles which you can use to your advantage. Obstacles include red bricks which you can shoot out of your way, silver bricks which are highly armored, water and ice. You start the game with a basic tank, which you can power up to better one little by little.

The game includes a construction mode, so you can make your own levels when you have played through all the 35 original levels.

    <desc>The first brand new NES action-platformer in years, coming soon from Sivak Games! Battle Kid promises to be an exciting release from the NES homebrew scene, and is due for release in cartridge form sometime via Retrozone in Mid-February 2010. The impressive map contains over 550 rooms with Symphony of the Night style continue points scattered throughout, and 5 different difficulty settings. All difficulties include one-hit kills, however easy difficulty allows for increased damage against your enemies with the 'Damage Amp' item (while your character sports a pink outfit). There are over 30 enemy types and 8 bosses, unlimited continues and a password feature is also included. Increased difficulty settings restrict the number of times you can continue as well as forbidding password use entirely. Contrary to some of the internet chatter surrounding this new release, the game was tirelessly designed from the ground-up.

Although influenced by the classic Mega Man games, it's not to be confused with a Mega Man hack. Sivak has also stated that the project was partly inspired by the more recent indie title "I Wanna Be The Guy" (notably with the included homage of dangerously lethal fruit), however, this game should not to be confused with an IWBTG port.

This is an ancient story of a time when men and gods lived together. In the land of Peloponnesus, there was a quiet, peaceful village called Elis. It was the home of the fairest maiden of all Peloponnesus, and a gentle yet brave young man called Orpheus. Helene and Orpheus swore eternal love to each other. But alas, one day, Helene fell victim to the fangs of a venomous serpent and perished.

Orpheus grieved over her death for three days and nights whereupon he heard the voice of Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love: "I have watched over your love and I know of the deep grief you now feel. But do not give up hope. Helene has not really passed away. Hades, the god who rules the netherworld of Tartarus, has taken away the soul of Helene so that he can make her his queen. The power of Hades is great, and he has many fearsome henchmen in Tartarus. The only way I can help you save Helene is to suggest that you look for three nymphs. They will guide you on your way to Tartarus. If your love for Helene is true, Orpheus, go now and save her." As Orpheus sets out on his quest to rescue Helene, your quest begins.

--From the NES Battle of Olympus instruction manual.

Overview:

Oh! My gods!!!

Get ready for this adventure/beat-the-crap-out-of-everything game, which by the way has almost the same engine as that of Zelda 2, so the graphics and the over all movement of the characters is great. The sound is the 8-bit so don't expect the Siren's song to be way too sweet sounding, but they did well with what they had.

A Muse your self with this classic Greek tragedy in video game format. Battle Cyclops, Harpies, and gods as you save your girlfriend from a Fate worse than Death. You play the part of Orpheus a brave young (wanna be) warrior who has lost his beautiful girlfriend Helene to Hades, the god who rules the netherworld of Tartarus.

So now it is up to you to save her, the gods can't do it themselves, bad politics and what not, but do not fear, the gods can help you along the way. They will give you certain items that will assist in the defeat of Hades, and the salvation of your beloved. So brush up on your Greek Mythology, we have a Damsel to save.

Directions:

OK, Let's Titan our belts and get this started. Hades has stolen your girl and we must get her back.

Travel the map from Crete to Phthia in search of the three nymphs that hold the love of your girlfriend, this is the only thing that will save your beloved. Along the way you will have to find gods and goddesses who have items that will help you complete your mission. Items can range from weapons that you use all the time to musical instruments that are used once or twice.

Some may be found by using clues given by people in the game, i.e. Ambrosia (increases HP Permanently) is found in certain parts of the map and can not be bought. Other not-so-common people will give hints and items alike in order to help you. Since this is ancient Greece, olives are the currency of the day and the gods just can't get enough, so keep as many on hand as possible. Keep in mind, if you die you will loose half of your olives.

Now you may be asking yourself, what are these items and how do I use them? Well, let's start with the menu at the top of the screen. This menu tells you, in order from left to right, first box is how many olives you have, second box is the weapon you have equipped, last box is your special or secondary item that is equipped. Next is the inventory menu, it has four basic parts, first, second, and third rows plus the very bottom has a spot for the three pieces of love from your girlfriend. The first row is where your weapons are listed, second row lists you secondary items, and the third row lists all passive items that are always in use. *Note that the salamander skins in the third row will become the salamander shield when a certain quest is completed.

Now that we can use the menu, let's get to the good stuff: weapons &amp; armor. OK, the very first weapon that you start with is your trusty Club "it is sturdy, made of wood" but rather wimpy when it comes to taking on the big boys. Next is the Staff of Fennel, it can cast fire and is somewhat stronger than the club. The Sword comes next, finally metallurgy, very strong but you loose the range attack that you had with the staff. Finally the Divine Sword, it has it all, the strongest weapon in the game and it shoots lightning bolts. Armor is next and it is scarce. There are only two shields, the first is the Shield of Athena acts as a normal shield, and the Salamander Shield which is a standard shield plus it blocks fire. The shields are passive and can not be switched, it automatically uses the best one in your inventory.

All other items are listed here in no particular order. I am not going to list what they do because there are far too many and it would ruin the game for ya. Here they are: Harp of Apollo, Ocarina, Trojan Pitcher, Eye of Graeae, Moon Crystal, Sandals of Hermes, Key, Bracelet of Power, Golden Apple, Nectar, &amp; Ambrosia.

Combat is much like that of Zelda 2. It is real time combat, hit the enemy with your weapon and stay out of danger by jumping or running. You may also block some attacks with your shield (mainly ranged attacks), and you must stand still and not swing your weapon for this to work. Speaking of combat, there are Bosses and Sub-Bosses at the end of levels, the real difference between the two is the amount of hits it takes to bring them down. These Bosses and other baddies range from Cyclops to Hydra and from Slimes to Hades himself.

Your first task will be to talk to Zeus, he starts it all. The gods are also your save points, so remember the words they speak. From there you are on your own, searching the map for clues that will eventually lead you to the final throw-down with Hades himself. Other familiar friends and foes appear in this game, from Pegasus who will take you from city to city, to the Three Witches that guard a single eye. So have a Classic adventure with Battle of Olympus.

Smoke 'em Out!

Somewhere - deep, deep behind enemy lines - they're holding your NATO Commanding Officer hostage.

You know that there's convoy after convoy of enemy tanks out there - as well as enemy choppers, transformers, nuclear power bases, fuel tanks and more.

What you don't know is how deep you have to go into enemy territory. Or what lies at the end of each of their strongholds.

But that doesn't matter. You're going in anyway. You've got to.

And besides, you're powering one of the toughest tanks ever assembled: the M1. Tons and tons of sheer steel power. Punctuated with one of the most effective 150 mm cannons ever to let go of a shell.

That doesn't mean your job's going to be a piece of cake. Hardly. It just means you may have a chance. A chance to go in there - all the way. A chance to smoke them out. And bring your Commanding Officer back alive.

--From the NES Battle Tank, Garry Kitchen's instruction manual.

Gameplay:

The player is placed inside a tank, hence the game has a first person view. The tank is equipped with a smokescreen, a missile launcher, a 150mm cannon, and a .50 caliber machine gun. The object of the game is to destroy enemy tanks and helicopters in the area. If the player fires the tank's guns for too long, they will overheat and will take time to cool down.

Earth is under fire by Colossus, a battleship the size of a city. Using powerful laser cannons, it has destroyed most of Earth's defence forces, while its many troops clean up the rest of the planet. All expect for 5 warriors.

The Battletoads, who are well aware of evil forces in the galaxy, join forces with Billy and Jimmy Lee from Double Dragon to defend Earth from the deadly ship and its troops. Using a range of special moves you must fight your way through the streets into the heart of the ship and destroy it.

Trivia:

Tradewest produced Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon with Rare without Technos Japan's supervision to use the Double Dragon characters in the game. As a result, even though the Battletoads characters were faithful to themselves (considering Rare developed this game), many of the so-called "Double Dragon" characters are either, misnamed or misrepresented in the game.

A machine-gun wielding boss that resembles Willy, the main bad guy from the original Double Dragon, is named "Roper" in the game, who was a small fry enemy in the series.

A small fry enemy in Stage 5, a fighter who wears a bandanna and throws shuriken, bears a vague resemblance to Williams in Double Dragon II, but his name is "Lopar", which was Roper's name after it was badly romanized in the instruction manual for the first NES game.

A few other enemies, like the "shadow marine", "doorman of doom" and the "windowman of doom" are described in the manual as Double Dragon enemies, but in reality they never appeared in an actual installment of the series.

The whipwoman Linda makes an appearance in the third stage, but in the manual she is given the fullname of "Linda Lash". The Lash surname has never been used in a Double Dragon and has only appeared again in the bombed live-action Double Dragon film.

And finally, a character by the name of the "Shadow Boss" is described to be the Double Dragons' main nemesis. However, no such character was ever featured in any of the Double Dragon games. The "shadow boss" name was actually Jimmy Lee's mistranslated title in the first NES game, wherein Jimmy was the final boss in the game (a plot twist that wasn't in the original Arcade version and was ignored in subsequent versions and installments Technos made). The "Shadow Boss" in BT/DD bears a vague resemblance to Burnov, the first stage boss from Double Dragon II.

Two anthropomorphic toads named after skin disorders (Rash and Zitz) have to save their friends Pimple and the Princess Angelica from the Dark Queen, ruler of Planet Ragnarok, with the assistance of Professor T. Bird and his space ship, The Vulture.

The backstory of Battletoads, written by Rare employee Guy Miller, was also published in a Nintendo Power comic. The storyline in Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is somewhat based on this back story.

Different levels of the game have very different play styles. There are a few 3D and traditional 2D "beat-em-up" levels in which the player progresses by defeating enemies, though even these levels tend to have many lethal obstacles. The most difficult levels are the obstacle course and race levels, where the character must dodge a series of obstacles while driving or flying at high speed, or outrun an enemy that can instantly kill the player. These levels typically required the player to memorize the sequence of obstacles in the way, and to have extremely rapid reflexes. Other levels include a climbing/jumping "snake maze", an underwater level with lethal spikes and dangerous monsters, and two difficult "tower climb" levels, including the final climb of the Dark Queen's tower.

Part of the series' marketable appeal is due to its exaggerated ways of finishing off enemies. These include a headbutt that would have the Battletoad sprout ram's horns (or, in Pimple's case, a football helmet in the arcade game), a punch with an extremely enlarged fist, a two-handed smash into the ground that yielded only the enemy's head sticking out, a kick move with the character sprouting a very enlarged boot, and on climbing/falling levels, the ability to transform into a wrecking ball by having your character line-up vertically on either the right or left side of the playing field.

Reception:

The original Battletoads was well-received by most gaming critics. However, it has been remembered for its extreme difficulty, even for experienced players.

One notorious aspect of the difficulty is that during a 2-player co-op game, one player may attack the other at anytime. This may be intentional, such as attacking the other directly, or unintentional, such as one player attacking an enemy with the other player getting in the way. This can be especially annoying with attacks that result in a one-hit knockout. There was no option to disable "friendly fire".

To compound the problem even further, Battletoads gives the player only 3 opportunities to continue after being defeated (many other games of this size gave unlimited opportunities), and has no password or save feature to enable the player to continue the game across multiple sessions. Therefore, only the most dedicated of players were able to beat the game.ion needed] Many players have also expressed extreme disappointment with Battletoads' lackluster ending sequence, feeling that they should be much better rewarded for having conquered such a difficult game.

Unlike many side-scrolling games in which two players cooperating can complete the game more easily than one, Battletoads becomes even more difficult to complete with two players, because of the many obstacle levels. If either player crashes during an obstacle course, both are sent back to the start to try again; thus, both players need perfect play to get through many of the levels.

The game is also littered with minor glitches that suggested poor beta testing. The most critical flaw occurs in level 11, entitled Clinger Winger. During a 2-player game, the second player is unable to move in level 11, and therefore must lose all of his or her lives before player one can continue the level. This makes finishing the game even more difficult for the second player, as that player had one less continue and any accumulated extra lives at his or her disposal. This glitch was removed in the versions of the game released outside the United States.

Two features did reduce the otherwise crippling difficulty of the game. In the second level, a quick player could gain multiple lives by repeatedly hitting defeated enemies before they fell offscreen; thus a skilled player could build up a store of ten or more lives to spend in future levels. Second, there were several "warp points" scattered throughout the game that let the player skip ahead two levels. A knowledgeable player could avoid approximately half of the levels in the game through judicious use of warp points.

Despite these concessions to the player, Battletoads for the NES has a reputation as being virtually impossible to finish, even among hardcore gamers.[who?][citation needed][original research?] The Mega Drive/Genesis version tones down the difficulty considerably, rewarding the players with more lives and generally featuring more forgiving controls and gameplay than the NES version.[original research?] Contrary to an otherwise common trend of Japanese releases of games being more difficult than their American or European counterparts, the Famicom version of Battletoads was also made significantly easier than the American NES release

The player controls Bee 52, a honeybee with large eyes and a fly-like sucker for a mouth, through which it can spit projectiles at enemies. The game is played through 12 levels, the first four in a backyard, the next four in a swamp, and the last four inside a house. There are traps and enemies added for each level, from ants, grasshoppers, and even dragonflies and "venus flytraps" in the later levels. The player must find and collect from many flowers scattered all over the sidescrolling level and return to the hive after three flowers are visited to add honey to the jar. The level is complete when the jar is full, in the case of levels 3-12, this requires every flower to be visited.

Gameplay:

Bee 52 is a flying side scroller. The bee is maneuvered by the control pad up down left and right over enemies, and through holes. The player can shoot at enemies straight ahead with the A button, or use the B button to sting enemies from above. Bee 52 can find add ons such as a super stinger with a longer reach, or more powerful projectiles either by killing a special lightning bug whose appearance is random, or visiting certain secret holes. There is also a small insect called Junior that, when found, will orbit Bee 52 indefinitely. If the bee is struck, Junior will be sacrificed rather than losing a life. Without Junior, a single hit will kill Bee 52, and lose all weapons found.

I'm the Ghost with Most, babe! Where can a ghost... like myself... go to find... a little ACTION! Look no further, this game has all the action you will need, babe! After Lydia, my one true love, goes missing in the netherworld, I have to go find her while at the same time trying to get those annoying Deetz's out of the house for my new friends, the Maitlands. Go ahead, make my millennium. Play Beetle...ah ah ah, nobody says the "B" word.

This game is as awesome as the movie, full of funny dialog and otherworldly oddities, not to mention good graphics for its time and interesting music that fits the game. So lets turn up the juice and see what shakes loose in this afterlife adventure with the ghost that's seen the Exorcist a hundred and sixty-seven times AND IT KEEPS GETTIN' FUNNIER EVER TIME HE SEES IT! Other than the fact that he's a dead guy, he makes a great video game hero.....WHAT DO YOU THINK? I think you might want to play.

Directions:

Play Beetlejuice as he searches the afterlife to save Lydia, tries to scare the Deetz family out of the house, and deals with the Maitlands and their whining. Run around the afterlife stomping enemies, and buy power-ups that help you along your way, from credits you earn.

These will give you different attacks, such as stomping your enemies and shooting balls at them.

Be careful when running around, 'cuz you only get to get hit three times before you die, and the only defence you have is not getting hit. Throughout this game you will be faced with all kind of strange enemies (mostly insects but no big bosses). This side-scrolling adventure is chock full of fun game-play and humorous dialog.

True story: when I graduated from St. Catherine's elementary school I was given the RELIGION award after the graduation mass. No joke! So when I play games from Wisdom Tree I am reminded that we should be good to each other, fair, courteous, and honest. I live by these rules every day and often pass them along to the little girl I keep chained up in the cellar. This game is actually three in one, and for some strange reason (perhaps my holy past), I kind of like it! Weird stuff happens, but nothing out of the ordinary by Bible standards.

Gameplay:

In Noah's Ark, the player must round up animals and food -- sometimes by knocking animals out or catching fruit thrown by a monkey -- and carry them onto the Ark. Noah's health is recharged when the player reads Bible verses that are scattered around the four levels.

In Baby Moses, the player controls Miriam, Moses' sister as she tries to save her brother from the Pharaoh's decree that all male Hebrew children be killed. In order to do this, the player carries Moses from one end of the level to the other, in a manner quite similar to the way in which characters in Super Mario Bros. 2 carry vegetables. Moses can be thrown around without harming him, but enemies cannot be harmed in any way. If the player completes the level without Moses, the game says "Good Work, But you forgot Baby Moses." and the level must be restarted.

In David and Goliath, the player starts out controlling David as he herds sheep and avoids predators such as lions and bears. The player then obtains a sling and goes on to dodge guards, scorpions, and stones before he fights Goliath's shieldbearer and ultimately Goliath himself, whom the player must strike once in the head to defeat.

All three of these mini games have identical character control fluidity to another NES game, Menace Beach. The sound effects for picking items up, throwing them, jumping and even a bird are also identical to Menace Beach, both games even contain a bird that picks up the character and carries them to a different part of the level. In Menace Beach, the bird carries you to a previous area, reversing your progress, while in Baby Moses, the bird carries Miriam to a further area, but makes her drop baby Moses, forcing her to go back and get him.

Criticism:

The game has been criticized for being overly didactic (e.g., gameplay is broken up by Bible verses), for being highly derivative of Super Mario Brothers 2, and for generally bad gameplay. Nevertheless, it sold reasonably well in Christian bookstores. It was featured on Seanbaby's EGM Crapstravaganza: The 20 Worst Games of All Time as the 19th worst game ever.

This video board game uses a thick book of Bible questions included with the game for certain sections. You can play well enough without it, however.

Gameplay:

The object of the game is to get rid of the food that tries to kill you. The weapons available to players are oil drums (whose exploding method emulates the mechanics from the Bomberman series[citation needed]); forks, knives, and spoons. The game also includes a quiz section where players answer three True/False questions in order to advance. These questions would be the only Bible references in the entire game, but they are only found in the game's instruction manual.

    <desc>
Walkthrough:

At the start, you can select which game you want to play. Select one and start playing!  When you want to stop playing a game, press Start for a big OLLYOLLYLOXINFREE (that's what you call to end a game of hide and seek) and select another game.

Game One:

Four of Big Bird's friends (Grover the blue monster, Elmo the red monster, Bert the yellow person, Ernie the orange person, and the Count, a purple vampire, are some of them) walk into apartment 123.  As each one enters, Big Bird says their name.
Once they all enter, Big Bird tells you to find one of them. By pressing the right button, you move a bird (is that Little Bird?) to a different window.  Move Little Bird to the window of the friend Big Bird wants you to find, then press A.  Not hard because you can see where the friends are.
Once you find the friend, Big Bird tells you to find another friend.  Continue until you find all four friends.  Then one of them comes out, goes left, does something, then returns.
From there, Big Bird automatically starts playing the game again.

Game Two:

Four of Big Bird's friends walk into apartment 123.  You get to see which windows they are at while Big Bird says their names.  Then the windows shut.  Hope you remember who was where!
Big Bird tells you find one of them.  Move Little Bird to the correct window and press A.  Do the same for all four friends to beat the game and see one of the characters do something (they do different things, for example, the count juggles and Grover pogo sticks).
From there, Big Bird starts playing the game again.

Game Three:

Four of Big Bird's friends enter Apartment 123.  Once they're all in, they show up at the windows, each one of them has a letter.
Big Bird tells you to find a letter.  Move Little Bird to the friend with that letter, then press A.  Big Bird then tells you to find another letter.  Move Little Bird to the friend with that letter and press A.
Repeat those last two sentences until you have found all of the letters.  One of the friends comes out, does something, goes back in, and the game restarts.

Game Four:

Four of Big Bird's friends enter Apartment 123.  Once they're all in, they show up at the windows, each one of them has a letter.  Big Bird says the letters, then the windows close.
Big Bird tells you to find a letter.  Move Little Bird to the friend with that letter, then press A.  If you mess up, it's okay.  Big Bird says to find another letter.  Repeat the process until you find all four letters.
Once you find all of the letters, one of the characters comes out, does something, and the game restarts when they're done.

Game Five:

Four of Big Bird's friends enter Apartment 123.  They show up at the windows, each one of them with a letter.
Big Bird tells you to spell a three letter word (like sun). Find the first letter, then the second letter, then the third letter.
Once you spell the letter, Big Bird congratulates you, and one of the friends comes out and does something.  The game then starts again.

Game Six:

Four of Big Bird's friends enter Apartment 123.  They show up at the windows, each one of them with a letter.
Note that there is a sun in the sky.  All throughout this game, the sun will start to set.
Use the four letters to spell a three letter word by choosing one letter at a time.  Keep spelling letters until the sun goes down.
Big Bird will read all the words you spelled.  One of his friends comes out and does something.  The game then restarts.

On their tiny prehistoric island, a whole village is starving and Thanksgiving is only a few days away! All the big game animals have left - they don't want to be hunted any more, and the cave clans are getting tired of eating lettuce. Bignose had heard a legend about a long forgotten peanut butter mine on the island, and he went off in search of it one warm sunny morning. He hadn't got far when an enormous pterodactyl flew high overhead...

"WOW! If I could catch that there big birdy then all the people in the village would have enough food for a great Thanksgiving! Forget the peanut butter mine - we're gonna have a roast birdy!"

And so Bignose set out on a hunting adventure which will take him over four islands, through perilous caves and even up into the sky!

    <desc>
NASCAR racing game with your choice of 3 cars and 4 tracks. Before the race you can change the angle on your spoiler and your tires. While driving the game gives you a drivers seat perspective. "Ladies and Gentleman start your engines".

Gameplay:

Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge is a simulation of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, and thus operates like a racing game. The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.

Players could chose to run single races at each track, or run for the season championship. The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races. In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks. In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races. Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.

Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen. Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not. However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.

They're Bill S. Preston, Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan, and together they are... WYLD STALLYNS!!! Excellent!!! When Time Rebels steal important historical types and move them around history, Rufus goes back in time to get these two bodacious dudes to fix everything. BOGUS!!!

This video game, although awesome as it is, was made to exploit the fame of the film (much like the second film). This game's graphics were note worthy at the time and the music wasn't bad either.

Strange things are afoot under the Circle K doesn't even scratch the surface. Much like the cover of Led Zepplin's Houses of the Holy, this game has many steps and columns. So join these awesome guys on their next adventure, as if a history report wasn't bad enough.

Directions:

In this game Bill and Ted must run around through time and seek out historical figures, such as King Arthur, Cleopatra, and Elvis, to put back in their own time. Use your directory to dial the numbers of time.

Talk to locals for hints, but watch out so that you don't get locked up. Use fire crackers to scare the locals, coins to distract them, and cassette tapes to make them dance; all to avoid getting caught, because you can't fight anyone.

While in the levels, use either Bill or Ted to find the historical figures, but first you must find the bait to get them to follow you. Remember if you lose with one character you will take over as the other, but there is no difference in game play between Bill or Ted. This game is a fun adventure full of puzzles, action, and humorous dialog, although it is somewhat difficult to play. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Throw
Start Button: Inventory, Pause
Select Button: Inventory, Pause

Hints:

Skeleton Keys
- Skeleton keys act like lives. When you get arrested, you have to use these to get out of jail. If you run out of keys, the game is over.

    <desc>Very sophisticated hack of Battle City. The game begins as usual tanks action with Binary Land's gimmick, but its gameplay keeps being fresh until the very last level. There are stages with various handicaps, timer racings, pure puzzles and even stealth action.

The game was greatly reprogrammed, now there's twice more code than was in original ROM. There are new map objects, better AI, boss stages, new music, particle effects and physics tweaks.

You should see the game trailer here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZe7q6Ki42g

The game consists of 6 chapters:

1. Reverse mode - simple tutorial on game mechanics

2. Impulse mode - learning new quirks + puzzles

3. Dual challenge - combining everything you've learnt

4. VG history - mimicking classic video games

5. Postmodern Age - some weird stuff + memes

6. Superplay - 7 steps of learning TASing

In this game, you have to guide two penguins, one male and one female, through top-down vertical levels. The penguins are in love with each other and must be re-united! The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.

    <desc>Not many games are audacious enough as to make you play the entire game as a baby. I mean, you're not even some kind of genius super baby, like in Captain Commando! You crawl around on the ground. And when you get all powered up, you walk on your feet, and it's just the most amazing thing you've ever seen. It's like when you see Professor Xavier walk around in the X-Men movies and you're all wowed, and then you're like, "oh duh, of COURSE Patrick Stewart can frickin' walk."

And your weapon? A rattle. Honestly, your baby character isn't very Bio Miraculous, but your rattle is pretty kickass. You can whack a monster with it and it'll get big and float away. Then you can jump on top of it and ride on top of it for a little while. Or, you can jump into it, and it'll fly off and hit other enemies. This is how you get rid of the bosses. Pretty clever! They try and mix it up with a SMB2-style digging level (think World 2/World 6) and a swimming level and stuff, but it just gets annoying. The game proper is a lot of fun, though.

Translation Description:

All the game needed was a title screen hack. So here ya go. Could've been better though.

Due to Nintendo's strict censorship policies, all references to the Nazi Party, such as swastikas and the word "Nazi", had been replaced with inoffensive material. This hack attempts to make the game be more like its Japanese counterpart. A few graphics have been switched, and the Badds are now Nazis. A few colors in the pallete were darkened, too, as Nintendo felt it was necessary to brighten everything up a bit. Also, a few parts of the script were rewritten/corrected, which unfortunately includes a famous quote by a soldier in one of the neutral areas.

I'll talk about a person which I've met when I was young.

In 198X we've found Nazz's top secret material called Albatross, a plan which never was put into practice. Imperial forces General Issimo Killt had never seen this plan, and decided to materialize this plan.

The federation decided to stop his attempt by sending our hero Super Joe, but lost contact with him. Our brave man (you the player) was sent to the empire with a special mission to rescue Super Joe, this story begins from here...

--From the NES Bionic Commando instruction manual.

Overview:

Bionic Commando is a pretty fun game. The graphics are well drawn, and the color palette was well chosen. The music was pretty good, but I found the sounds annoying. There were too many high pitched noises and white noise. The controls were responsive, but the bionic arm maneuver has nuances that are a little tricky. The gameplay is fun, but I didn't like the lack of ability to jump. In place of jumping you have the bionic arm. This unique game is definitely worth a try.

Directions:

Save Super Joe and the world from the Badds by making it through 19 areas: 12 main stages and 7 neutral levels. When you begin the game, and between stages, you view a map of the areas. You move around like a board game to each area, then you decide which weapons and items to take with you.

Once you're finished, you descend into a side-scroller action stage.

Use your bionic arm to swing over gaps and climb onto ledges. You can also use it to grab items that are out of reach. You start out with a normal gun and no life meter, but every enemy you kill gives you a bullet, and if you collect enough bullets you earn an extension of your life meter. You also need to bring your communicator with you into each area so you can keep in contact with your unit.

The object of each of the main areas is to destroy the energy core at the end. Each area you complete also earns you a new weapon or a useful item. You should also visit neutral areas, where firing is prohibited, for more items and information.

Power-ups include bullets, 1-ups, energy potions that refill your life, P.O.W. that will protect you from bad guys, and an eagle badge will give you a continue. There are also several weapons, including: standard cannon, wide cannon, rocket launcher, three way cannon, Super Joe's machine gun, and Hal's Bazooka. There are four different communicators, red, green, blue, and orange. Each one will be used in different areas to communicate with your cohorts, or to tap enemy lines.

There are also accessories that you can use by pressing start. Energy recovery pills recover energy, oddly enough. Flare bombs can be used to see better in the dark areas of level four. The rapid fire device allows the first weapon to fire without having to keep tapping the button. The permit will allow you to enter level 14 after you find it in level 6. The iron boots allow you to kick enemies to death when you swing into them rather than just stunning them.

Then, there is protective equipment that you will need to know about. The pendant will protect you from the first bullet to hit you in a level. The helmet will protect you from the first three bullets. The bullet proof vest will last the whole time, but it will only work for the first bullet in every burst of gunfire. 

Localization:

For the release of the American and European versions of the game, several changes were made. Due to the strict censorship of Nintendo of America at the time, all references to Nazism were removed from the American and European release. This meant that the swastikas shown on cinema sequences or the background of some levels were replaced by Albatross figures. Furthermore, the enemies were renamed from "Nazis" to "Badds" (though the backstory in the instruction manual referred to them as "Nazz", and the European game manual still mentions Nazis). Also, the name of the leader of the Imperialist group was changed to Generalissimo Killt.

One of the most known changes involved the final boss of the game (Adolf Hitler). For the American and European versions, the name was changed to "Master-D", but he still clearly resembles Hitler. There is a notably gory ending sequence in which his face explodes, which was kept intact in the American and European versions; unusual considering the heavy censorship issues at the time. In the artwork for the American and European versions, the figure of Hitler was changed to a man with a hat, a heavy beard, and glasses.

Another difference is that there are some areas of the game in which the difficulty has been reduced

BONUS: Check out "Bionic Commando '99" for the uncensored version in English!

    <desc>The whole game's got a Metroid kind of feel, but just does it all wrong. You're running around in a series of nonsequential corridors, while being attacked from all sides by a whole crapload of enemies, and all you have is a sword that takes you forever and a day to swing around. And when you jump, you just kind of pause in midair and then fall, like the game's telling you "okay, this is how far you go when you jump and that's it." And did I mention these enemies? There's tons of them! And they keep respawning! Forever! And most of them take two hits, which means that you hit it once with your sword, wait a few moments for your sword animation to finish, get hit by the enemy, and then kill it with your second hit. Maybe I don't have much patience for these games anymore, but this wasn't very much fun.

The player may select a beginner's game or ranking game. A ranking game requires a password. From here, a player may select a location on the lake to start at and begin fishing. Simply tossing a lure out with the desired power will start the process. A fish can be lured in by moving the lure around and if it bites, then the player can try reeling it in.

Between rounds, the player can select from different types and colors of lures.

Easter Eggs:

To make catching fish a lot easier, enter HBMAX as your name. This unlocks a meter that shows how "attracted" fish are to your lure; keep it above 6.0 for best results.

Welcome to the Big Time

After a hard nosed season in the teeth smashing NHL farm system, you've finally slap shot your way into the pros. Now you're just another no name rookie up against the finest fore-checkers ever to grace the rink.

You've got confidence, and with stick in hand you're looking to bring home the cup, win MVP, make the covers of major sports magazines, and date a beautiful New York model (not necessarily in that order).

But you'll soon learn that in this league nothing's ever given to you, and before you can reach your goals - you gotta score 'em! You've gotta possess both the artful skill of a finesse player and the bone crushing brutality of an enforcer. You've gotta defend the goal against unrelenting power plays. And, finally, defend yourself when anger flares, gloves come off, and fists start flying.

So strap on Blades of Steel, and prepare to make a name for yourself. Or be put on ice by the hottest hit men in hockey!

--From the NES Blades of Steel instruction manual.

Overview:

Control the Hockey players in a somewhat intense old school Hockey game.

Directions:

Slap the puck around, defend your goal, get into a fight. The fights are probably the best part of this game. If you lose, you go to the penalty box.

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: Pass, Change Player
Start Button: Start, Pause

Hints:

Sound Test
- At the "Ultra Games" title screen, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, B, A, Start. This should take you to a sound test screen where you can have fun messing with all the sound effects in the game.

    <desc>Blaster Master: Pimp your Ride, is an assembly hack for the NES platformer Blaster Master. Changes to most of the areas are minor save for areas 1 and 2 tank section, which are re-done. The changes are made to utilize the full effect of the ASM hack, and premise of this hack which is the 8 new additional upgardes the tank can get.

Yes, 8 new upgrades. That means the game has a total of 15 upgrades in all, and almost all of them are going to be needed to finish the game. Along with that are some other ASM changes, one that would need explaining is the gun powerup system. Instead of one gun unit equaling one level, you must collect many gun units to raise you gun power. The upside is that you do not lose your gun level if you get hit or die. This means that any powerup you find will not be wasteful.

There are also other changes as well that will become apparent when you play. This hack was started sometime last spring or summer and deamed complete on December 31 2006. If there are any bugs, don't hesitate to point them out.

This game is about a guy named Jason.

Jason had a pet frog named Fred. One day, Fred decided he had enough of being locked up in a fish bowl and made a dash for the door. As fate would have it, Jason was there when all this happened and he gave chase. Once outside, Jason was totally amazed to find Fred running toward a huge radioactive chest. As soon as Fred touched it, he grew to an enormous size, and the radioactive chest fell into the earth along with Fred. Jason tried to reach for Fred but fell into the hole along with him.

When Fred landed, he found himself alone next to a huge armored vehicle. This was not just any vehicle, but one designed for the ultimate challenge against the radioactive mutants living under the Earth's crust. These mutants, created from escaped radioactive waste, are controlled by the Plutonium Boss.

Your mission is to fight your way and destroy the Plutonium Boss before he destroys you.

Along the way to your final encounter are many warlords of the underground you must destroy.

--From the NES Blaster Master instruction manual.

Overview:

The frog you brought to school for biology class has taken a sip of radioactive liquid, and has mutated into a hideous monster! You jump down where the frog went, and you find a really cool tank and outfit! Now you get into the outfit, hop into the tank, and set off in search of your frog!

Directions:

This game takes place in both a platform and overhead manner. You try to get to the boss like in many games. In overhead mode, you try to overcome traps and puzzles to flush out the boss! If you do defeat the boss, you get a new ability for the tank!

Controls:

A Button: Jump (hover when held), Throw grenades
B Button: Fire
Down + B: Special Weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Get out of the tank while in platform mode

Hints:

Easy Boss Defeats for Levels 2, 4, 6, and 7
- During the boss battle, quickly throw grenades at the boss as fast as you can, he will begin to flash. Press pause while he's flashing and wait 25 seconds, unpause the game and the boss will explode.

    <desc>I knew from the time that I say this hack sitting in the queue that it was going to be one of those quirky hacks that just makes me laugh for no apparent reason. While one could argue that this patch is entirely pointless, which for the most part it is, the concept behind it is somewhat absurd and amusing.

I do have a bit of criticism, however: The sprites and BG graphics are still using their original mappings. For some things which are already block-shaped, like Mario, this works out fine. For others, though, it does not, and they don't look nearly as blockilicious as they could. Ideally the mappings should be edited so everything looks like it's constructed entirely out of stacked blocks. The palettes for some things don't look so hot either, I think those could do with a bit of editing. Also, the new ending text is lame, bitch!

I honestly want to see a version 2.0 of this hack, with edited levels designed to take advantage of this new, block-based Mario reality. Justify its presence on this site, Eclypsis! The hack just barely made it on as a graphics and text overall, go the rest of the way and make it truely complete!

The player controls a fisherman who is competing in a tournament. The objective in each round of the tournament is to catch the largest sailfish-class fish. These fish include blue marlin, black marlin, striped marlin, swordfish, and sailfish. Other fish that can be caught include dorado, barracuda, tuna, and sharks.

As the player fights fish, there may be several events that occur that the player must respond to, such as a smoking reel or a marlin attempting to tangle the line in the propeller. Other events are static, such as the fish biting off the line or the fish becoming exhausted. Each of these events changes the dynamics of the fight, such as changing how much line the fish has or how tired the fish is.

There are three attributes that the player can increase as they fight more and more fish. These are Muscle Power (ability to pull in heavier fish), Body Strength (ability to fight a fish longer), and Skill (ability to respond to events properly).

The Blue Marlin features a password system to save the player's progress. A password is generated at the end of every tournament round, and after the tournament is completed (with the player victorious). If the player uses this password to begin a new tournament, they can start over with all of their attributes from their previous game.

BACK IN TOWN

Jake and Elwood Blues are back in town to put on the greatest rock'n'roll show ever seen. However Sheriff McGraw hasn't forgotten the chaos created the last time these two boys passed through town. To prevent the Blues Brothers from getting to the stage on time, the Sheriff has sabotaged all routes of access. Jake and Elwood have to find their own way to the stage.

Despite the Sheriff's efforts, Jake and Elwood are pretty sure they remember the way, or at least the general direction. To avoid being detected, they pass quickly through the shopping mall and then sneak into the back of a warehouse. Unfortunately, Jake and Elwood make a wrong turn and wind up in prison. However, through their clever maneuvering, they manage to escape. The Blues Brothers continue on, sneaking through the sewers and finally reaching the concert hall by passing through an abandoned building site.

Jake gave a little smile "Watch out!" he shouted. "The Blues Brothers are back and you'd better be ready".

--From the NES Blues Brothers instruction manual.

Overview:

Jake and Elwood Blues are heading for the greatest blues show ever... And of course, they are the stars. But the Sheriff wants to stop them, so they will have to be a bit creative in their route. Help them get to the stage on time by running, jumping, swimming, riding rabid dogs, and avoiding the sheriff's men, as well as all kinds of birds and beasts that will get in their way.

Directions:

The Blues Brothers game has great entertainment value, even if it's just in some of the small stuff that makes it interesting to watch for the first few minutes. Perfect example, when you jump, you grab your hat so it doesn't fly away.

Great detail!

On the other hand, the controls are a bit finicky and parts of the game are uselessly difficult. Perfect example, right on the first level you have a long jump with a very short runway, and your timing has to be absolutely perfect to make it across. Fortunately it's not a fatal fall, but still it's annoying to have to run around the same screen a bunch of times, just to make a jump that has no business being so hard to make in the first place.

Trying to figure out how to avoid all obstacles can be fun for a while, but eventually you tire of having no way to defend yourself from your invincible foes. Even though Joliet Jake weighs 400 pounds, he can't squash baddies by jumping on them, and there are all these spiky green balls that appear mystifyingly at the absolute worst time and place to kill you whenever you try to do something important and/or difficult.

Overall, I'd say this game wasn't worth much. It's one of the chief reasons people are suspicious of movie/tv franchise games, as it's one of the worst examples. If you're a huge fan of all things Blues Brothers, playing this game may change your mind. If you're on a quest to conquer every Mario-rip-off platformer, you have your work cut out for you. If you are neither of the above, you probably should be playing some other game. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Run
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Choose Jake and/or Elwood

Hints:

Use their Eggs Against them
- Avoid falling eggs when they are thrown at you by birds or spiders. But when they are on the ground, you can kick them at your enemies to take them out.

King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or turned into rocks and trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple  just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.

A Bomberman named White Bomberman is framed for terrible crimes by Black Bomberman. After being accused of robbing a bank, White Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman's mission is to escape his prison cell and the guards.

Gameplay:

The game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.

Passwords are given after game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts allowing the player to continue where they left off.

New to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the 3-player mode.

Bomberman is a robot engaged in the production of bombs. Like his fellow robots, he had been put to work in an underground compound by evil forces. Bomberman found it to be an unbearably dreary existence. One day, he heard an encouraging rumor. According to the rumor, any robot that could escape the underground compound and make it to the surface could become human. Bomberman leaped at the opportunity, but escape proved to be no small task. Alerted to Bomberman's betrayal, large numbers of the enemy set out in pursuit. Bomberman can rely on bombs of his own production for his defense. Will he ever make it up to the surface? Once there, will he really become human?

--From the NES Bomberman instruction manual.

Overview:

Blow up everything! Well, except yourself, and that gets harder and harder. Blow up walls and baddies. Collect cool bomb upgrades that do things like allow you to drop more than one bomb at a time, or give you a bigger explosion thus allowing you to destroy more blocks faster.

The graphics are fairly simple, but it doesn't make the game any less fun to play. The enemies look really surprised when they die, it's funny. Most of the sound effects are your standard bleeps and blips but the explosion sound is pretty good. The music is cornball but hey, I love it.

Directions:

Work your way across the screen blasting walls and baddies. Upgrades work as follows:

BOMB lets you drop more bombs (max of ten)

FIRE increases your blast by one square in each direction (max of five)

HEART allows you to detonate bombs remotely whenever you want

SKATES allow you to move faster

QUESTION MARK makes you invincible to baddies and explosions for 35 secs

BOMB WITH LINES allows you to walk through your bombs

MAN WITH LINES allows you to walk through bricks

BLACK FIGURE WITH FLAMES means you are now fire proof and can't be hurt by your bomb's fire

Collect the upgrades to make your game easier, and find the door within the time limit. If the time runs out, red button baddies will appear and they're super fast. They are just about impossible to survive. Defeat the enemies and then go through the door.

If it's a bonus level, then there will be nothing but baddies. You cannot be hurt on this level, so let loose and kill as many baddies as you can within the time limit. 

Controls:

A Button: Leave a bomb
B Button: Detonate bombs remotely (with HEART upgrade)
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Switch Choices in Startup

Hints:

Baddie Boom
- If you bomb a door or an upgrade, then meaner, faster baddies will come out of it. Avoid that.

Know Your Losses
- If you are killed, you only lose the walk-through upgrades, detonator, and flame-proof upgrades.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Port of the popular TurboGrafx-16 game, where Bonk really made a name for himself as the official mascot of the system. A complete copy of this game is worth more than twice its loose value.

Story:

The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies. Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur). In the Arcade version, he is also assisted by a female version of himself.

Gameplay:

Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.

Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups, these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk. Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.

Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two, rare, blue heart powerups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.

Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totalled at the end of each stage, after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a cave-man type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.

The game is set in a pre-historic environment, complete with cavemen and dinosaurs. You play as a little boy who has to collect treasure without being killed by those ferocious creatures. The only thing you can do to immobilize the enemies is setting a trap right before they approach you. This gives you an opportunity to gain some valuable time. The enemies will pop out of the traps a few seconds later. The game is divided into levels with increasing difficulty. At each level, your goal is to collect all the treasure before you can proceed. You die if you allow an enemy to touch you.

    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>This is the pirated version of the SNES game, "Boogerman: A Pick And Flick Adventure" which I believe originated from Russia. A decent port none the less it still has its pros and cons like all pirates do. If I ever get a scan of the cart I'll put it up. From what I saw it was an orange Famicom cart with the cover being ripped off from some magazine with a superhero on it form a cartoon back years ago.

Storyline: (3/5) A millionaire by the name of Snotty Ragsdale is cleaning up professor Stinkbaum's lab (a millionaire who has janitorial work... maybe he pays a lot of money?) and comes across a weird invention. This invention takes care of garbage on Earth and around the galaxy by using portals and such which disposes of filth. Ragsdale has his suspicions that the location of the garbage maybe hidden somewhere on Earth itself. Goblins and other monsters seem to be using the portals themselves and its up to Ragsdale to become the almighty superhero, Boogerman and save the day.

Graphics: (3/5) The graphics are pretty "dirty" compared to the SNES version. Obviously they were cut down a lot and you actually are in a complete different level starting off from the SNES version. In that game you started off in a swamp and in this one you start off in a cliff/canyon level for some reason. None the less, the animations are well done in an illegally-ported-from-Russia type way. When the enemies die they turn into pinkish blobs, so that's cool. At least they captured as much of the gross magic as they could.

Sound: (4/5) The first thing you notice is that the sound used in this game are not your ordinary pirate music! Of course, they weren't created by the guys who made this pirate nor are they from Interplay, the original makers of Boogerman on the SNES. They are actually from Konami of all companies! Don't believe me? Press start and you'll hear the classic Konami pause sound, jump on a trampoline and hear SFX from Contra and Gradius... maybe the music is ripped from Konami games as well? Oh well, regardless the sound and music kicks ass for a pirate and it is stolen... that's what pirates do after all.

Gameplay: (3.5/5) Basically, there's a lot of stuff removed from the SNES version. The power meter is gone since there's no way to burp or fart in the game and the charge options are gone. Plus, there's no password feature which hurts the game a bit. None the less, you can still spit loogies and throw snots at enemies which is alright in a really disgusting, weird way. You go through level to level collecting plungers, you start off with 5 lives, and your energy bar is represented by a long chunk of barf by Boogerman himself which gets smaller every time you get hit... nice! You can also dig through crap or something and dig out more plungers... nothing beats Mario getting coins though. You can also go down toilets and into secret worlds but again, Mario going down pipes is better yet again!

Control: (3/5) The controls are pretty simple, B throws snots/spits loogie, A jumps, and start pauses the game. Compared to the SNES version, a lot is missing from the original. You can't fart or burp let alone charging up any of those attacks. Despite this, the control seems to be superb for a pirate. You can move and there is no problems except for some slow down and flicker but that's it. The jump is extended if you hold the A button so it takes a while to get used to.

Fun Factor: (3/5) Boogerman can be fun for a couple of hours or how ever long the game lasts. If anything, it's just the amusement of it being illegal and a pirate that makes it exciting. You can think of this game being a slower version of Mega Man, only you throw snots and all that. The Konami SFX are funny especially when Konami had nothing to do with Boogerman at all.

Frustration: (3/5) From what I have seen, there's quite the amount of glitches in Boogerman. I'm not sure if this is just the ROM of it I play, but when you go down toilets to extra worlds, you end up falling from the game into a hole of graphics gibberish and die. You are brought back to the normal level, but the place is a mess with slower scrolling in the background and you can't tell what's land and what's a hole due to the fact that there's garbage all over the screen. So much for the games perfect programming huh. That's not all. In the intro, it tells the story of what's going on in this ugly green font in the words, "... the world from pollution by transexisting it to dimension transexisting it to dimension x". Why did they repeat that whole line for? Maybe for emphasis on the word "sex" being shown? All I know is that it cuts off and isn't complete compared to the SNES one. As for the game itself, it isn't as fun after multiple times of play. The control of Boogerman's jump is kind of awkward as you hold A to keep him up and the first second you let go he falls down.

Overall: (3.5/5) The game is good for a couple of laughs; something to remind you of the SNES not-so-classic game. Plus, even if you are lucky to own this it's nice for the collection since it is a Famicom pirate made "from Russia with love" or illegal methods to get money!

-Jason Hogan

The "acclaimed", "innovative" SNES adventure game shows up as a Russian-produced famicom cart. Are you in total disbelief? With modernized games like Pokemon 2k and A Bug's Life, just about anything is possible to come out of the pirate field!

The orange cartridge features a corny superhero to the right of an amazed, formulaic family of onlookers that only a Mega Man cover could love. The letter "C" embroidered on the figure's chest and neat attire is a tad falsely portraying the game's main character, Snotty Ragsdale.

Nothing is shown on the back of the cart.

Story/General:

I'm going to be honest about the game's storyline- I don't know what the hell it is. At the start of the game a screen shoots up with Boogerman cleaning his house and awful (like, REALLY awful) green font squeezed at the bottom. Then there's the repetition.

"...THE WORLD FROM POLLUTION BY TRANSEXISTING IT TO DIMENSION TRANSEXISTING IT TO DIMENSION X..."

My first response was to take the repeating words as a joke. "Ha ha, SEX is in that word! Ha ha, there it is again! SEX!"

For our more mature readers: It's only going to get worse..

Concept/Control/Sound:

You assume the role of Snotty Ragsdale, a rich (but bad hygiened) "superhero", flicking snot and spitting loogies onto oncoming monsters. It's not fun, or funny. The potty humor gets old the first time. And this aspect of the game takes up most of your energy.

Which now moves us to the game control. You can use the directional buttons to move, you can jump, and you can "shoot out nasties" to inflict damage to enemies. Two of the three gameplay options I have issues with: Moving is awkward, and jumping almost always causes massive slowdown. But rest assure, flicking boogies isn't too problematic.

SNES/NES Comparison:

Truthfully, the SNES Boogerman is cleaner (pun not intended), smoother, more complex, and a lot more fun than the cheap pirate I am dedicating this entire page to. I don't consider Boogerman to be a classic, or an even good game for that matter, but it has its obvious (and less obvious) unique touches. The NES pirate, however, unfortunately loses all of this and instead just plain stinks (pun INTENDED!).

Stoneford, an old adventurer ill in bed, called his son, Rockford, to his side. Handing Rockford an old map, he said: "My son, you must take up the quest I never completed. Find the Secret Jewels of the Six Worlds, and you will be rich beyond your wildest dreams!" These were his final words.

As Rockford, your quest begins in the strange and perilous Boulder World! An underground world swarming with weird enemies, all out to prevent you from collecting the priceless diamonds just waiting to be mined. Can you master the enchanted walls, transform butterflies into jewels, find the mysterious escape tunnel, and get away from the growing amoeba before it engulfs you?

    <desc>Bowser's jumping challenge is a throwback to old-school platform gaming. It's been specifically designed with the focus on completing difficult jumps rather than defeating enemies. The developer also made sure to keep the game playable, so you won't find any "impossible" scenarios to overcome. As a word of warning, the nature of this game may make it difficult to complete using a keyboard. A gaming controller is definitely highly recommended.

Bram Stoker's Dracula is the title given to a number of games based on the 1992 film of the same name. Gameplay for each game varies greatly from platform to platform, but they all retain a similar plot based on the movie. You control a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Dracula's capture, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.

The DOS version is an adventure game played from a first person perspective. The 16-bit console versions are side-scrolling hack-and-slash games. The Game Boy version is also a side scrolling adventure game, but places more emphasis on level exploration than fighting. Finally, the Sega/Mega CD version is a side-scrolling fighting game that uses full-motion video backdrops and digitized actors.

BreakThru is set on an island that has been taken over by the enemy. Your job is to blast your way through the six different areas of the island and give the island back to its rightful owners.

Data East has been known to come up with games that are either really bad, or really good. I'd have to say this one was really good. BreakThru is one of those games that is a good mix between difficult and fun.

Directions:

Fight your way through the six levels to save the island!

You have a little assault vehicle that can go pretty fast. You can also make it jump on command. As if this were not enough, you have guns on the front of it that can be upgraded to some pretty powerful combinations. You will need to watch out for foot soldiers, armed trucks, missiles, and even falling rocks.

To play through you will need to vary your speed at times. The difficulty level of the game will depend on your speed. The faster you go, the harder it will be; however, to make long jumps you must be going fast. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Mines
- You don't have to dodge the mines: if you shoot them, it will disable them.

BreakTime: The National Pool Tour is a pocket billiards (pool) video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. There are four unique challenges in the game, eight-ball, nine-ball, rotation, and straight pool. All four are allegedly played according to the professional (i.e. world standardized) rules.

    <desc>I love Europe. I've never been there, but I'm sure it's a beautiful place. I'd love nothing more than to gaze upon the fantastic beauty of the Eiffel Tower, the physical loophole that the Leaning Tower of Pisa somehow got through, or tour each and every Bavarian castle. Oh, the sights I'd see.

I also heard once, probably as an ignorant kid, that a big thing over in Europe - specifically, around Paris - is the whole expressing love freely bit. We caught on for a while in the late 60's and all of the 70's, but let it go in favor of yuppies by the 80's. I don't know if that's really true or not, either, but judging by this game's origin, whether or not it's a stereotype will remain shrouded in mystery still more. I always enjoyed thinking about tall, slender, supple women in wide-brimmed hats smoking out of three-foot-long filters with the actual cigarette (slim, I assume) at the end, then putting it out in the sand and stripping it all off, walking to the beach wearing nothing but a coy smile, sitting so long under the bright ways that it's a wonder she's still as pale as she is. Before you jump on my back, let me remind you that I'm a red-blooded American guy; let me have my dreams, please.

Bubble Bath Babes (Panesian, 1991) is one of the funkiest games I've ever seen in that vein. It's an idiosyncratic puzzler that can best be described as a mix between Tetris and Bust-A-Move centered around a generous dosage of 8-bit nudity. The naked women are more of a gimmick than anything, but they are lucky to be there. BBB (B3?) is one of a very low single-digit number of games that, to make a comparison, got through the metal detector with a full suit of armor on. Whatever the Nintendo censor was drinkin' when this one got by, I'll have a double. I do not hope, however, that the entire point of this game was to include a bunch of chicks in the buff with bubbles positioned only in front of their most strategic genitalia in order to ensure that some puerile teenager gets his jollies. If that's what your money is worth, then by all means buy this game. For the more objective gamer, this game may be chock full of the women what ain't got no clothes on, but someone did say once upon a time that beauty is only skin-deep. Underneath the surface, there's actually a nifty little puzzle game to be found within.

In BBB/B3/Babes'R'Us, a naked woman lies supine at the bottom of the field of play, with different bubble arrangements rising up from behind her (ahem) that interlock at the top of the playing field - because see, bubbles are lighter than air and so they rise and whatnot. You learn something new every day. Unlike Tetris or its red-headed stepbrother Columns, however, you're not fitting them into lines here. As in Bust-A-Move (naked dinosaurs in that game - it's not quite the same thrill), a combination of enough bubbles of the same color will cause them to disappear, as well as any below them that aren't attached to anything else and have nowhere else to go. An ''A'' mode and a ''B'' mode have subtle but noticeable differences; ''A'' mode is the classic keep-the-bubbles-in-check bit while ''B'' starts with a pre-ordained amount of bubbles that must be cleared to keep the game going, adding challenge, I suppose. Like any good puzzle game with falling or rising pieces, the increases in speed start out practically unnoticeable but eventually pile up into something moving undeniably fast and out of control. It may seem like the next puzzler on down the line, but there's a fascinating attraction, which has nothing to do with the women, mind you, that keeps you playing. It's a conglomeration of ideas that might well be mistaken for originality if you're not on your toes.

BBB is divided into levels similar to the way of Tetris Attack; that is, clear enough groupings of bubbles and the game lets you move forward. Cutscenes featuring women smack-talking each other come in-between (ahem #2), but are of little consequence. Consider them a reward if you like, but it's another way for Panesian to sneak disrobed women into the game. It's like the whole developing staff was comprised of 13-year-old boys. You have puzzle game, women, puzzle game, women, and so on for an indeterminate number of stages. It doesn't take a whole lot of time sitting down with it to see that the game, like a high school graduate who chooses Undecided as their major, doesn't quite know what it wants to be just yet but is slowly but surely getting there. Is it a cheap porno or a real game with real entertainment value? Like it or not, your maturity and moral stance will decide for you. There is substance, but how far are you willing to dig before you get to it?

As the case may be though, we men would definitely rather go buy Maxim off the newsstand than look at this game for two hours hoping something happens, but there's no denying that it's as good-looking an 8-bit nudie cart as there is. From the title screen's enticing animation to the smoothness of the gameplay and movement all around, this is as pretty as it got back in the day. The transparency effect on the bubble is a cheater's way out, as any blind goofball could see that they're up against a black background. The cutscenes have the same spotless animation. There's hardly anything there, so of course you would expect only the best from these European first-timers. It all looks good and runs fine, and everyone's happy.

Then there are the naked women. I won't talk about the naked women. You ought to know what naked women look like. If you don't, borrow your biology teacher's Gray's Anatomy pocket edition or your parents' Kama Sutra that they don't know that you know they have.

The music is like the Russian symphonies from Tetris minus the accompaniment. A beat here, a beat there. If you listen real hard, I think it forms some kind of song. Not totally clear on that, though. The bubbles form an obvious but funny ''pop,'' and then before you know it, you're at the back at the file cabinet in the Sounds drawer. The bulk of the game's sound relies on sound bites from boys that will go around talking about the naughty game they just found:

''There are BOOBIES in this game!''
''For reals?''
''Totally!''
''Oh man, let's go play it!''
''BOBBIES!''
''You just said 'bobbies'.''
''No I didn't.''
''Yes you did.''
''Nuh-uh! POOPHEAD!''

Even though it lacks direction, Bubble Bath Babes is, believe it or not, worth playing if only to see the interesting mixture of ideas that went into its development. They all combine smoothly to make a fun enough game, and bare-bottomed chicks actually seem like the perfect way to wrap up the package. So they're there for the sake of being there. So what? Get over it. If you're going to let a woman with no clothes on handicap your enjoyment of this game, then you're missing out on a puzzler that has no real intriguing ideas but is still a blast to play through. The same thing goes for letting a woman with no clothes on handicap your objectivity as well. Some games have more on the surface than just skin and nipples. One would do well to realize this and find a game that has the nerve and verve to sit by other games on the shelf or in the Plastic Tub O' Cartridges. Even if that does mean it's committing indecent exposure.

Ha ha, I just thought of a double entendre for the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but I can't use it here.

Man, I really need to visit Europe now.

In a strange and magical forest full of danger and delight, where everything is good to eat, and jolly round dinosaurs bounce and play in peace, lived two such creatures named Bub and Bob. One day Bub and Bob got word that two of their Brontosaurus buddies had been abducted by Baron von Blubba who lived in the evil forest just beyond the horizon. So Bub and Bob set off to find their friends and bring them to safety, but the Baron had sent many ill-tempered and hungry beasties to the forest to stop Bub and Bob from finding their friends. Only Bub and Bob's magical bubble-blowing powers could save them from spontaneous ingestion.

--From the NES Bubble Bobble instruction manual.

Overview:

One of the classics of the NES, Bubble Bobble is a game that every retro gamer should play at least once in their life. Originally on an Arcade platform, later on it was ported to several other systems, including the NES, and never lost its charm. It featured a very original game-play style, a kind of action puzzler/platformer.

The graphics match the cheerful mood, a simple yet whimsical atmosphere about as you're playing, and they are quite good for this old system. The cartoony sounds match everything well also, even if the theme song is probably the only one you'll hear most of the time. But it's so classic and fits the mood. Taito definitely has made their mark in the gaming industry with Bubble Bobble, and you'll be hard pressed to find anything more unique. A recommendation for all gamers!

Directions:

As either Bub (green) or Bob (blue), your objective still remains the same: clear each and every level to advance on. To do so, you must defeat each and every enemy. The way you accomplish this is quite different from other games.

These dragons have the ability to fire bubbles from their mouth, and if done right, these will be able to trap your enemies. However, to fully claim your win, you have to pop the bubbles with the enemies inside. Some will be easier to defeat than others. For example, the Bubble Buster is the first you encounter and with limited abilities, it shouldn't be difficult to defeat. However, creatures such as the white robbed Stoner can fire at you which you will need to be able to evade.

Defeating enemies is essential, and if you can pop many of them at once, your chance for bonus rises. For example, if many trapped enemies are touching each other, you'll be able to pop all of them due to a chain reaction, and then items such as food will scatter. Items like these will give you bonus points, so be sure to gather as many as you can before the next level comes.

    <desc>BBM is a complete overhaul of original Bubble Bobble, with much, much harder stages and some neat graphics and palette changes. Note that it is possible to beat the first 15 levels without a continue, not really that hard, hehe.

All levels have been hacked. Enemy Graphics have been given a facelift or totally changed. Graphics for just about everything else has been edited.

    <name>Bubble Bobble: Part 2</name>

Late-era Taito games seem to have been made almost exclusively for the rental market. This is still a little easier to find than the others, though. Not to be confused with Rainbow Islands, which is the arcade sequel to Bubble Bobble.

Story:

According to the NES version's manual this game would supposedly star Bub and Bob as the original duo. However, the protagonists are actually intended to be Cubby and Robby, their descendants (hence the name "Junior" used both in the NES game's bonus rounds and in the alternate title of the GB port - see Notes for more information).

As seen in the game intro, Cub, and a girl named Judy, were sitting in a park. Suddenly, a floating skull character captures Judy into a bubble, and sends her and Cub into the air. Two characters named Drunk (from the original Bubble Bobble) follow the skull and take Judy away. Cub turns into a bubble dragon and heads off to rescue his girlfriend. There is also a two-player mode, leading one to assume that Rob has suffered the same events as Cub had. However, the manual states that Judy is a friend of both.

In the Game Boy version, Rob has to rescue people from a village, who are assumed to have been captured by the skull character.

The NES version actually features three Skull Brothers as the final villains. This story was anticipated in the Rainbow Islands arcade version's ending, which was left in Japanese but revealed that the spirit of the final boss, the giant Skel-Monsta had, upon dying, split into three that would eventually come back as the Skel Brothers to be fought by Bub and Bob's descendants a hundred years later (consequently this game would take place at least one generation or more after the events of Bubble Symphony).

Among Collectors:

Because of its late release on the NES, Bubble Bobble Part 2 is exceptionally hard to find and is sought after by collectors. Loose copies of the game routinely sell on eBay for between $100 and $150.[3] Complete-in-box copies of the game carry prices ranging between $300 and $400 on eBay and Amazon.com.[4]

The game was only available on the rental market, making it difficult to find even at the time of its release.

Development Notes:

- The game's plot was originally preannounced in Rainbow Islands. Obtaining the true ending in the Arcade version of that game, would display a screen with text in katakana. Oddly this was presented as the "Legend of Bubble Bobble 3". Below, the enemies of the original Bubble Bobble were seen as they turned into human beings. This last bit doesn't seem to have any particular significance. 
- There are a few bonus games after each world (after an area boss is defeated) in the NES version, or if the character heads into a secret door in a world. 
- Cubby/Robby changes back into a human in the "good ending" of both versions. 
- In the NES version, the bubble dragons are larger than the enemies (and more cute than usual, probably due to the simplicity of the game sprites). In the Game Boy version, the dragons and the enemies are about the same size. 
- The back of the box of the NES version states that the two main characters are named Cubby and Robby[5], but the manual contradicts that, and says their names are Bub and Bob. 
- In the Game Boy version, the starring character is named Robby. 
- In the NES version, in the bonus games, the starring characters are named "Junior". 
- In the Game Boy version, the player has a sort of spiritual guide (he just shows up but does nothing) helping them that looks kind of like a Viking. It is unknown whether this character is referenced in other Taito games or what other meaning there may be to him. 
- By holding the 'Bubble' button, the character can inflate and become able to float, as long as the bubble button is held and the character does not touch a hazard. 
- In the NES version, the characters actually inflate. 
- In the Game Boy version, a bubble forms around the character. 
- Though there is a mention of a Cave of Monsters when beginning the NES version (it is only a copy of the opening script of Bubble Bobble), there isn't one in the game. Most of the game takes place under skies, though the world bosses' levels take place in caves.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Bucky O'Hare and his crew fight to save the universe from the terrible toad menace. On their way to their home base, they were attacked by toads and Bucky's crew was captured and scattered around the solar system. Now it's up to you (you green rabbit you) to save your crew and stop the evil Toad Air Marshall before he carries out his plan of conquering the solar system.

Based on a short-lived cartoon series and comic book, Bucky O'Hare is a great game, with dynamic gameplay for a platformer. The graphics in this game are excellent, including double scrolling with the foreground and the background, not to mention the weapons' effects. The music in this game is also excellent, with perfectly matched music for the different levels.

This game is not for the faint of heart, though, puzzles and challenges in this game will test even the most talented of gamers. So, if you think you're up for it, log in and play your heart out!

Directions:

Bucky O'Hare is a fun and challenging platform game. You play Bucky, the green space bunny with the special ability to jump, on his quest to retrieve his crew from the evil space toads. This game is unique in its ability for you to choose the stage you start on.

Go through the first four planets to save you crew from the toads. Fight through each planet until you get the boss. Each planet has a different boss, such as the battletoad bubble tank, the toad boulder thrower, the ice gator, and the toad battle tank.

Save your four friends, and use their special abilities to get through the other stages. Blinky the robot can break blocks and ice with his blaster, and he can charge his power to use his jet pack. Dead-eye the duck has a three-way shot, and he can climb walls with his special power. Jenny the cat has a laser beam and a turbo blaster. Willy the human boy's special power is an all-in-one shot that shoots in all directions. After saving your crew, fight through the toad mothership to the Air Marshall and stop him from taking over the galaxy.

Along your way, you will find several power-ups to help you out. Some will restore your health, some will give you an extended health bar (which is on the bottom of the screen), and others will extend your power bar. You will even find 1-ups which give you an extra life, which comes in handy since you only have three. Not to worry, though, you have unlimited continues. All in all, this is a fun and challenging game that will have you playing for hours.

    <desc>
It's Bugs Bunny's 50th birthday and a grand celebration has been planned by his fan club. However, his fellow Looney Tune pals are jealous of all the attention that Bugs is receiving. After all, no one has ever given such parties in their honor! It's up to you to guide Bugs to his birthday celebration. To do so, you'll have to avoid the other Looney Tune characters and the contraptions they have unleashed to prevent Bugs from reaching the party.

--From the NES Bugs Bunny's Birthday Blowout instruction manual.

Directions:

Jump and mash enemies and obstacles in general with your Looney Tunes mallet! Or... just jump and run. You don't need to destroy most of the enemies in this game. You can collect Carrot Blocks for use in the minigame later, as well as turning them into WB blocks you can stand on.

In the minigame (how many carrots you have determines how many times you can play) you stop the roller on a number, and you hope it lines up.

If you get 3 numbers in a line, you get one extra life. If you get 4 in a row, you get 5 extra lives. Now, if you are incredibly lucky, or using save states, and manage to get all five in a row you get FIFTY (50) extra lives!

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use Mallet
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Bosses
- Many of the bosses, such as Daffy Duck, are invulnerable to Bugs Bunny's mallet. You'll need to find a way to get around him rather than try to fight him.

Welcome to the Crazy Castle! Listen, Doc, it's up to you to guide me, Bugs Bunny, through the castle and rescue Honey Bunny. But don't think it's going to be easy! Those rascals Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Wiley Coyote, and Yosemite Sam have captured Honey Bunny and hidden her deep within the castle. Along the way we have to collect all the carrots while avoiding those rascals. OK, Doc, let's get going!

--From the NES Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle instruction manual.

Gameplay:

While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Because most NES game cartridges lacked the ability to save, passwords can be used to start at a certain level in this game.

Version Differences:

The US and European games were modified versions of the Japanese Famicom Disk System game Roger Rabbit. Roger Rabbit is the game's playable character, all the villains are all Who Framed Roger Rabbit-related, and hearts are collected. The Game Boy version is actually called Mickey Mouse in Japan and the villians and music are all Mickey Mouse-related.

While enjoying a drive with your girlfriend in your car that you have named "Popper", you are attacked by a ruthless gang called Jackals.

Your girlfriend is kidnapped by Jackals in their big off-road vehicle. The girl's pleading voice is heard to say "Help me!" as the vehicle speeds away.

You, of course, must chase down the gang's getaway car, and when you meet up with these enemies, you will have to fight them anyway you can.

You will try bumping with your own car, crashing into them, even leaping on top of them in the hope that they will be crushed. All this is necessary to save the girl and get her back!!

--From the NES Bump 'n Jump instruction manual.

Overview:

The story is kind of like Macbeth meets Dukes of Hazzard meets Knight Rider. Of course, this is all just theory.

Ok ok... it's just a simple 'bad guys stole your girlfriend story'.

Directions:

A simple, yet addictive arcade game. The premise is to get to the end of the road, crashing as many cars as you can. You can do this by knocking them into the side, or by jumping on them. You'll have to be careful, though: every time you hit a car you lose Power, and you'll need to collect more from the Power cans out in the road. You'll also have to jump obstacles.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Brake
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Continue
- After you lose all your lives, hold down select on controller 1, then hold A and B on controller 2. Now simply press start two times on controller 1.

The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures -- the robo-mutants. It's up to you to stop them! Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.

Burai Fighter is an arcade shooter with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, you'll be armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything onscreen.

Hints:

To start the game with full complement of weapons, enter LTBB on the password screen.

As Chef Peter Pepper, you must fend off the Food Foes while making perfect burgers! Use pinches of pepper to stun Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Egg and Mr. Pickle; or lure them onto or under burger buns, lettuce, cheese or tomatoes to escape their clutches! Making perfect burgers gets progressively tougher through the six screens of BurgerTime.

--From the NES Burger Time instruction manual.

Overview:

This arcade game ported to the NES is a lot of fun to play. The controls are easy to learn and so is the gameplay. The graphics are colorful and only lack a little of the arcade's luster. The sounds are very much the same as it's arcade counterpart. With the difficulty level going up and the mazes changing as you go higher in level, it's fun for pros and amateurs alike.

Directions:

When Peter Pepper walks the length of an ingredient, it falls one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is complete when all vertically aligned buns, meat patties, and lettuce leaves are dropped to the bottom of the screen.

When all burgers are completed, the level is finished.

While making burgers, Peter Pepper must deal with three enemies: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, killed, or temporarily stunned. Killing occurs when an ingedient is dropped atop an enemy, or when support for an ingedient is completely removed and the enemy falls with the piece. Scoring depends heavily on killing enemies. The more enemies killed with a single sequence of falling ingedients, the higher the score. Therefore, to obtain the best score the player must endanger Peter Pepper by allowing more than one enemy to move onto the ingredient the player is on, just before the player drops it.

Peter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French Fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.

Each level becomes more difficult, with the layout of later levels making it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach ingredients. 

Controls:

A Button: Use pepper
B Button: Use pepper
Start Button: Start/Pause game
Select Button: Choose 1 or 2 players

Hints:

Bonus Items
- Be sure to grab the Ice Cream Cone, Coffee, of French Fries when they appear in the middle of the screen. They don't just give you extra points, they also give you more pepper spray to fend off the baddies.

Burger Express Elevator
- Instead of just dropping burgers on them, try to make the burger fall while a bad guy is standing on it. He'll fall to his hilarious doom, and you'll rack up big bonus points!

Your Orders, Soldier

At ease! Major I.M. Havoc here - Combat Consultant to the International World Affairs Council. We've just received notice of a world-wide assault being planned by D.R.A.T. - the Dreaded Republic of Allied Terrorists. The Council has instructed me to select a volunteer to defuse the situation... and guess what? You just volunteered!

Get ready for a week's R&amp;R (Recon and Ruination) at the terrorist camp, on a secluded island paradise. You'll stroll the warm, tropical beaches as bullets shred the sand at your feet. Gaze at enchanting sunsets as you dodge the raking fire of deadly combat choppers. And admire the beauty of ancient ruins. And then ruin 'em some more!

This is strictly a covert operation. The Council cannot claim responsibility for you if you fail. You're on your own and if ya' mess up, it's your hide. The entire terrorist camp must be wiped out or the vermin will begin their reign of terror.

Leave no buildings standing. No ships floating. No choppers flying. And most importantly... clear the entire zone of enemy personnel!

Keep your eyes open and your finger on the trigger. Complete your mission and the world can breathe a sigh of relief. And good luck, soldier. You're gonna need it!

Major I.M. Havoc
Combat Consultant, I.W.A.C.

--From the NES Cabal instruction manual.

Overview:

The point of Cabal is to to defeat D.R.A.T (the Dreaded Republic of Allied Terrorists, I know, awful) by wiping out men, helicopters, buildings, and pretty much everything. A great game if you just want to destroy, destroy, destroy. Play with a friend, if you don't mind sharing the massacre, and you can watch each other's backs, or fronts in this case, since the enemies are all in front of you.

This game is colorful, and it's pretty easy to see what you're doing. Objects on the screen are crisply lined and identifiable. The music is not really anything to speak of and can get on your nerves, but hey, you can always mute it.

Directions:

As mentioned, the idea is to destroy everything. Here's an idea of how. Demolish your way through 5 levels of enemy camps by depleting the enemy strength meter. Destroy men, vehicles and buildings with machine gun fire and grenades.

Pick up better guns to add intense and rapid fire to your gun. Pick up as many grenades as you can, you'll need 'em to blow up tanks and such.

Take evasive action! Hold down the B button and move the joystick to execute dives, rolls, and jumps to avoid incoming fire.

After you beat a stage, you will do a little celebration before moving on to the next battle. It's worth playing Cabal at least once to see our hero dancing like he's late for the bathroom. Who's idea was that? 

Controls:

Hold A Button: Fire machine gun
Tap A Button: Throw grenade
B Button: Dodging Maneuvers
Start Button: Start Game, Pause
Select Button: No Use

Hints:

Barriers and Obstacles
- There are many objects on the screen which can be destroyed by grenades or guns, such as walls, buildings, trees, etc. Use the closer ones as a shield from enemy fire, and try not to knock them down (the enemy will do that for you). The enemy will use objects for protection as well, so you may want to knock those down, but it isn't necessary to complete the level.

    <desc>Transtlaion Description:

Cadillac is a puzzle card game featuring several women that try to take every last bit of money from you. The object of the game is to clear all of the cards at the end of the deck, which can be pretty tricky. During the game, you have cards that come down from the top and make their way to the bottom where you position them to make poker combinations, like three of a kind, 4 of a kind, 5 of a kind, flushes and straights. There are 10 levels to beat in this game. Your reward on a few levels is to see a full screen view of one of the women that host the game. This game is a one or two player game.

There are glitches and flickering in this game that are normally in the non-hacked version of the ROM.

Game Review by Santulli Slant:

Have you ever been to a casino and wondered if those bums on the street were once "non-bums" that simply gambled their lives away? Lucky for video gamers there's protection from that ever happening to US! Yeah, we have "simulations" to keep us out of that kind of trouble. I lose my shirt every time I play C'sar's Palace, but it's better than being a bum, I figure. Kind of a small gaming environment for such a big place, and an extra game or two, like Craps, would have really helped. Not bad, but nothing to leave Vegas for. Side note: the cashier looks like Vanna White.

California Games was the original "Extreme Games" -- what today's generation might call "X-Games in the sun". Compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. Some events are ranked by judges (Surfing), which gives you a score to help you improve your routine.

Easter Eggs:

- On some random occasions, there is an earthquake during the skateboarding event, causing the H of the Hollywood sign to fall down (The remaining "OLLYWOOD" might also be a reference to the ollie skateboarding trick.) 

- Players can hit the seagull (named 'George') in Footbag. Hitting the gull grants more points. 

- There is a Shark in Surfing who sometimes appears laughing at the player if they fall off their board. Sometimes, Dolphins also appear. 

- When practicing Flying Disc, a UFO occasionally 'abducts' the catcher of the disc. 

Hints:

Get Many Points for BMX
- When playing the BMX part of the game, press select to score points. You can keep pressing this to gain as many points as you want.

Six of the newest video games in one amazing cartridge, for the price of one! COSMOS COP: Action packed space war game with 6 levels. High skill necessary. MAGIC CARPET 1001: Catch the treasure of the Magic Lamp to win the game. Play through 4 exciting levels. BALLOON MONSTER: To exchange time with space, hit the bubbles at their highest point. 50 amazing levels. ADAM &amp; EVE: Play through 40 levels, killing all the snakes and catching all the apples, in order to win. PORTER: Test your IQ by moving all the boxes to where the stars are through 25 challenging levels. BOOKYMAN: Clean the streets and keep them clean while trying to stay alive. Eight fun levels!

Trivia:

Soon after Caltron produced their 6 in 1, possibly due to some financial trouble, they sold their remaining stock to a Texas-based video game company called Myriad Games, Inc. Myriad Games re-released the 6 in 1 with their own label placed over Caltron's label, and with a new manual and box. Each respective cartridge and box of this re-release has a serial number, and the highest number found has been 888, according to the Digit Press rarity guide, making the Myriad version the rarest commercial NES game released in North America.

Believe it or not, this game is NOT based on the 1991 Data East coin-op. Original programming, w00t!

Players can choose to play one of four superheroes - Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, or Vision - as they battle through New York City, the underwater world of Atlantis, and eventually into Red Skull's moon base, which has a giant laser cannon pointed at Earth for destruction. The game comes in both two and four-player cabinets. In the two-player version, each player chooses the character they want to play whenever they start or continue. In the four-player version, each character is assigned a specific coin slot and set of controls. The program can be switched between two and four-player modes via a dip switch setting.

Gameplay:

Each character can attack and jump, and also pick up and throw certain objects positioned in each level, i.e. bricks or barrels. Attacks are accompanied by comic book-style sound effect words such as "THWAK!," "WHAM!," "KABOOM!," "KRAK!," etc. Each character also has a special projectile attack, and the ability to block certain shots. The players battle their way through hordes of relatively weak enemies who die after only a few hits, then must face and defeat more powerful boss characters at the end (and sometimes in the middle) of each level.

The boss characters in the game include Klaw, The Living Laser, Whirlwind, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, The Juggernaut, Ultron, Crossbones, and Red Skull. Other Avengers such as the Wasp, Quicksilver, Wonder Man and the Sub-Mariner make cameo appearances. The giant robot seen in the second stage resembles either the Sentinels or Master Mold.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Based on the 1990's cartoon of the same name.

Gameplay:

The game has five levels, each of which was divided into two different type of stages. The first stage involves controlling the international teenager heroes (Planeteers) flying their Eco-Jet to some enemy fortress, while trying to avoid the instant death that occurs by touching any of the scenery or getting hit by the various projectives.

The second stage involves controlling Captain Planet himself as he fights his way to a ecovillain from the animated series.

Reception:

Most video game critics panned the game for its weak graphics, limited playability and difficulty. Mindscape was one of the many third party publishers of NES games that had a reputation of releasing low quality products.

The difficulty in the game arose from the fact that the various powers of the geocruiser or Captain Planet had to be cycled through while the player was being actively attacked.

    <desc>In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.

There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word "CAPTAIN SILVER". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.

Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the "clock" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the "boot" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the "coffee?" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.

There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.

Translation Description:

This is a complete translation patch for the NES game Captain Silver. Some people find this game to be rather bad, but I'm here to tell you that they're wrong. This game is a shining star of excellence with great gameplay, great music and greatest of all is the game's story marvelously translated by Eien ni Hen.

Is Earth Doomed?

Aliens have invaded our planet. Their mission: destroy Earth!

In remote corners of the globe, these evil invaders have built four land bases -- each designed to drain Earth's energy and "feed" it to their space station. In just a few days, the power drain will be complete. Then the alien space station will vaporize Earth with a deadly laser blast.

Only you can stop the horror!

You must fight the alien forces, destroy the enemy bases and blow up the alien space station. But how?

Our top scientists have created a special fighter jet just for you -- the F-14VTS. Whether you're soaring over mountain tops at Mach 3, or floating in hover mode, your F-14VTS will measure up to any challenge! It's equipped with a spy satellite viewer that lets you see your plane from above as you fly it. And it's loaded with incredible weapons! Additional firepower is available at your own space station!

Nobody said it would be easy!

These devious aliens will attack you with everything they've got -- from conventional planes and tanks to the most bizarre alien weaponry. You must be ready for anything!

After destroying the enemy bases, you face your final challenge: the dreaded alien space station. There's only one weapon powerful enough to destroy it -- the top-secret Neutron Cannon.

Unfortunately, our scientists haven't finished developing it yet! They're working like crazy in underground caverns to complete the project, but they need your help! (As if you didn't have enough to do!) You must drop much needed supplies to them before the secret weapon can be completed.

Have fun Captain! It's time to fry some aliens!

--From the NES Captain Skyhawk instruction manual.

Overview:

I feel the need, the need for speed! No, wait, that's Top Gun, Highway to the Danger Zone and all. Aliens have invaded the earth, and it's up to you, the world's best pilot, to stop them. Kill their tanks and planes, deliver supplies, and rescue the scientist so you can get the secret weapon to destroy the Alien Space Station. Good Luck and God Speed, Captain.

This game is a riveting top view shooter with awesome graphics and gameplay. The music was something new at the time, and sound effects were outstanding. This game was unique with its interface and gameplay. All in all this game will have you stuck to the screen for hours.

Directions:

This top view shooter is an excellent flight simulator packed full of action. You must destroy the enemies on each level, blow up the platforms, deliver supplies, and then after all of that, you must shoot down enemy planes. Don't forget to pick up the coins, that's how you buy gun upgrades that make your gun shoot faster and give you more missiles in your space station. After all that is done, dock with your station and pick up weapons upgrades to meet your final challenge, the Alien Space Station.

Controls:

A Button: FIRE GUNS
B Button: FIRE MISSILES, DROP SUPPLIES
Start Button: PAUSE
Select Button: COMBINE WITH LEFT OR RIGHT TO BARREL ROLL

Hints:

- Coins -
Kill five of the same enemy in a row and you will receive a coin.

    <desc>Captain Tsubasa 2 - Super Dream Team

Captain Tsubasa 2 is a great game. But after a few matches you may find it very difficult. Also your team leveling up is very slow. And the CPU goal keepers tend to catch all your shots. Another point to note is your stamina: it drains very quick. I've hacked this game a bit to make it more enjoyable (under my personal criteria :P):

- All your characters have Infinite Stamina.

- All your characters have the Max Level.

- When you press select when playing a match, the timer will reset to 00:00.

- When you press start when playing a match, you will add 5 goals to your score.

- You start with the following team:

Normal Team:

- The GK is Wakabayashi
- Player 2 is Kapilman
- Player 3 is Zagalo
- Player 4 is Napoleon
- Player 5 is Diaz
- Player 6 is Pierr
- Player 7 is Schneider
- Player 8 is Carlos (Santana)
- Player 9 is Coimbra
- Player 10 is Tsubasa
- Player 11 is Hyuga

And when you reach the Asian Cup:

- Bench (Reserve): Player 12 is Riverio
- Player 13 is Nei
- Player 14 is Santamaria
- Player 15 is Toninho
- Player 16 is Jethrio
- Player 17 is Souda
- Player 18 is Matsuyama
- Player 19 is Nitta
- Player 20 is Wakashimazu
- Player 21 is Lennart

Thanks a lot to Pugsy and Ugetab, and all the cool people at GSHI. Without their support, I never could make this hack possible.

    <desc>The basic stuff from the first Tsubasa game is here; you've basically got a big game of Blitzball going on. There's a lot more going for this version though, especially since you can actually see other players now! And apparently there's a lot more plot, that is, a lot more I had to fast forward through before I could actually play the game. Naturally, if you had to pick which Tsubasa Famicom game to play, I'd pick this one. So there.

Welcome to the Casino. Some of the world's best (and worst) gamblers have come here to play various games, like Draw Poker, Blackjack, and Craps. Among them, you're a kid trying to fit in. With only 500 dollars in your hand, you've got to beat everyone in the casino and get to your rival. Can you do it? If you do, you'll be known as the 'Casino Kid', with fame and a nice fortune. But if you fail...you go home a broke and miserable kid.

Directions:

Play games of poker, blackjack, and craps among the best gamblers of all time, and eventually play against your rival.

Among all the NES games, this one is long forgotten, and has been replaced by the online poker websites. This game is a perfect training tool for people learning to play poker. The gambling just makes it even more fun and exciting, although some people are against it. So normally, today, this game might get an M rating by the ESRB due to the gambling. But the image of a 'kid' in a casino? That might be a little confusing, because kids and teenagers aren't allowed in the areas involving gambling. But in this game, no one cares. So just hit Play Now and waste your fake play money. 

Controls:

A Button: Talk, confirm selections
B Button: Fold in poker games
Start Button: Select from Main Menu

Hints:

Get a Jump on the Game
- To make the game more realistic, when you start out, you'll play against guys that almost tell you what they have in their hands. They'll say things like 'What is this hand?' or 'Alright!' to describe what they have. If it's 'alright', fold, unless you think you've got a better hand. If they say 'what is this hand?', slowly milk them, by making small bets, then on the last bet, wager the most you can and they'll fold.

Bluff
- If you don't know what a bluff is, it's a way to get your opponent to fold when you have a bad hand. For example, let's say you take on the first guy and he says 'It's fun' (as in, it's an OK hand) and he wagers about 30 dollars. Play along till the last one and wager as much as possible. And if he folds (he might not) show him that you just have a crappy hand and he has an average one that's better than yours. He'll say 'Oops' and you've got his money. Easy, eh?

Castelian is a platform game with some distinctive unique features. Your character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built onto the sea.

The actual game play happens at each tower in turn. Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top. The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators. Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no "left" or "right" edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.

A graphical innovation, and perhaps the most notable feature of the game, is that when Pogo walks left or right, he always stays in the centre of the visible screen. Instead of the Pogo sprite moving, the tower behind him turns clockwise or counterclockwise with a convincing sense of depth. This was featured favourably in reviews of the game.

Along his way to the top of the tower, Pogo encounters many different enemies, mostly shaped like basic geometric shapes. Pogo can shoot some of the enemies, while some are impervious to shooting. Contact with an enemy knocks Pogo down to the ledge below. If there is no ledge below, Pogo falls into the sea and drowns.

Once he has reached the top of the tower, Pogo needs to enter a door to trigger the tower's destruction mechanism. After that, the tower crumbles to the sea. Pogo then boards his submarine and enters a bonus stage, where he can shoot various kinds of fish to score bonus points.

Originally titled Nebulus on other platforms. Also known as Tower Toppler for the Atari 7800.

Castle of Deceit is a sidescrolling game for the NES where the player takes control of a wizard trapped in the titular castle with only one spell to defend himself. The game was often considered frustrating for its length and lack of a save or password system.

Story:

Phfax, a mystic being, and wielder of the Emerald Magic, consented to offer his life to protect the stones of Rune. For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden. Until at last it drove him insane. Such was the power of the stone that even the bitter hallucinations of his madness were given life. Six deadly beings appeared, stealing the Rune Stones. You, Cebo, the most promising of the young Magicians of Dace, must enter the castle, exploring the realities. But do not trust your senses - what you see, what you hear may all be a lie!

The Dragon Master, DARKLARZA, has been laying siege to Offeria for two decades. King Boros has been forced to live in exile in the mountainous region of Menlary. Geraden, Duke of Menlary, has successfully defended his castle from the hideous Legions of the Undead, but Darklarza's forces are growing in numbers and confidence.

King Boros has offered the hand of his lovely daughter Princess Amoreena to Geraden but the duke has vowed never to marry while Offeria is under the Dragon Master's control.

Under the cover of darkness, Darklarza's horde has assaulted Castle Menlary, a bold but futile attempt to seize the last stronghold of the living. As Geraden is fighting his way to the Death Stalker leading the attack, he learns that the entire battle was only a diversion.

Dragon Cub, the wicked offspring of Darklarza, has dispatched the royal guards and kidnapped the Princess, mortally wounding King Boros. Geradens fate is now clear. He must fight his way to Darklarza Castle to do battle with the Dragon Master Himself.

But Darklarzas power makes him virtually invincible. The duke will need many items to help him defeat the scourge on Offeria. The only thing that cannot be destroyed by the dragon's fiery breath are the scales that cover its body.

The Dragon Masters dark magic is unbelievable. Part of his magical strength comes from a crystal ball that once belonged to Geradens mother, Offeria's greatest sorceress.

Darklarza also holds King Boros - golden suit of armor. The duke will need this to protect himself from the crushing blows of the dragon's massive tail.

Only one weapon in all of Offeria is strong enough to pierce the flesh of the Dragon Master. Even so, The DRAGON SLAYER is not long enough to do any damage except where the skin is the thinnest.

Even after twenty years of fighting Geraden is still not ready to take on his arch enemy. Darklarza knows this and that is why he has stolen the princess. The duke must now hope that the experience he gains in fighting his way to the castle will be enough to protect him from the Dragon Masters spells.

There will be one experience that Geraden cannot prepare himself for. Before he can face the Dark Lord he must first face his most dangerous foe....Himself!

Most important, Geraden needs Your help to fight through the never-ending onslaught of the Legion of the Undead. It will be your skill and wisdom that will guide him through the perils that await.

For Amoreena, For the honor of the house of Menlary!

FOR ALL OF OFFERIA

--From the NES Castle of Dragon instruction manual.

Directions:

Collect power-ups in this side-scrolling game to strengthen your character before you get to the end. You can upgrade your Suit to a blue one, which will add an extra health bar. Your weapon upgrades don't all stay with you, but some do. You keep the Knife, and Mace, but you'll lose things like the Thunder, or Wave Sword after their time runs out.

You can block medium hits by not doing anything, and you can block high hits (and flying monsters) by pressing down. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Nothing
Select Button: Pause

Hints:

Bosses
- Don't just charge at the boss. A good strategy is leaping over it, and when it follows you then leap again to gain enough ground in front so that you can turn around and unleash some stabbity death. Some bosses are too fast for this, but they just run back and forth across the whole screen so you only need to jump them in the middle.

A long time ago in a faraway land, there lived a lovely young princess named Margarita. Her beauty and grace were known throughout the land - especially to to Mad Mizer, the Dark Lord of the grim Groken Castle high in the Forbidden Mountains. He had vowed to make the Princess his queen; and so, one terrible day he sent his ghoulish helpers to capture her, and she was carried off and imprisoned in one of the hundred miserable rooms of Groken Castle.

News of the kidnapping spread throughout the kingdom, and many courageous young men braved the perils of Groken Castle in an attempt to rescue the Princess, only to become hopelessly lost in the complicated maze of rooms, ensnared in one of the many treacherous traps, or foiled by Mad Mizer's deadly servants.

Finally the news reached the worthy Prince Rafael, who had long loved the Princess from afar. Raising his sword to the heavens, Prince Rafael swore that nothing would keep him from her side, and set out on his Castlequest. The odds against him seemed hopeless... But legend has it that two magical Fairies have been held captive in the Castle for centuries. If the Prince can find and release them to gain their help, he may yet succeed in his quest. And to rescue his fair Princess, he is prepared to face the deadly wrath of the Dark Lord himself!

--From the NES Castle Quest instruction manual.

Gameplay:

The player can push certain objects throughout the game to accomplish progress. In some rooms, the prince can only advance to the next room by aligning cement blocks, Honey Jars, Candle Cakes, and Elevator Controlling Block. In some rooms, this can be quite time consuming since the prince can only open a particular door if he can stand by the door. Meaning that he can not open the door while jumping in mid-air. The prince must also carry a key that matches the color of the door he intends to be open.

The player can navigate the castle with the help of a map that can be obtained from the first room that he/she begins. The map will provide the player with a matrix of 10x10 rooms and will highlight the room in which the princess is located.

A notable difference between the MSX and NES versions is that the player can attack enemies with his sword (or dagger) only in the NES version. While this attack is limited due to the fact that the enemy must be very close to the player for the kill to take place, which puts the player in the risk of being killed by the enemy because timing is crucial. The prince can dash and retrieve his weapon on a timely basis, and attacking in the wrong time can prevent the player from launching another attack when the enemy is in the right location to be attacked, leading the certain loss of one life from the player. This scenario, however, is not relevant to the MSX version, since the only way to eliminate an enemy is to throw an object on it.

    <desc>This is an overhaul of the original Castlevania done using Stake, Tilelayer Pro &amp; Hex Workshop. Many changes from the original have been made during the production of this hack. It took quite a while to complete, but the result was well worth the effort. All graphics of characters were done by me, bit-blade, moonchilde &amp; revility. Bit-Blade &amp; I also created the stage's background graphics and Several changes involving the game's engine were done through hexadecimal by me. Some of these changes include jumping higher &amp; whip while walking (which is sort of a mixed blessing.), and the drop item ratio.

Several features were used in Blood Moon that were prominent in the original Castlevania, but not utilized. For example; the water's splash effect, having to break a path through the wall to proceed, and bit-blade's unique tile solidity glitch, and a few booby traps along the way which all make for substantially more interesting gameplay.

This is a very difficult game, for master vampire killers only. If you happened upon it by mistake, then run! far far away! wuahaha!

This is a pretty good hack Dr. Mario and Optomon have put together. The graphics are really great and it looks like almost none of the original graphics remain. And the new level layout, themes, and MUSIC make this seem like it's a new Castlevania game. It's worth playing through to the end due to the Dance of Pales remix included in the last level, that's one of the things that made me play through the whole thing. I rarely play through a hack from beginning to end so I think that says something. I highly recommend playing this hack at least once if you are a Castlevania fan.

Hack Description:

This is a hack of the original Castlevania for NES that optomon and I have been working on for over a year. Optomon has done all the coding, music, and some level design, and I've done all the graphics, some level design, and the map. So what's changed?

+ New GFX
+ New levels
+ New level paths
+ New map
+ New sub-weapon
+ New music
+ Music on the title screen
+ New enemies
+ New bosses

STORY

1476, Romania. A terrifying castle rises up from the mist. Along with the castle rose a dark powerful being named Count Dracula Vlad Tepes. A man named Trevor Belmont was fated to defeat the powerful vampire, aided by a witch named Sypha, Dracula's own son Alucard, and a pirate named Grant DeNasty. Together the team traversed the dark halls of Castlevania, defeating the count and his countless minions.

In 1777 a young child was born, and abandoned on a merchant ship with nothing but a headband with a mysterious crest, and the name Armund. The sailors raised the child on the high seas, and taught him the ways of being a sailor. Armund grew to be one of the greatest men that the merchant ship ever saw.

Late 1797, word started to spread of the legends of Count Dracula, and his tyranny in the land of Romania. It was about that time, that Armund ran into an old Romanian man in Serbia. The old man knew a lot about the history of Count Dracula, and his reign of terror in Romania. The old man recognized the crest on Armund's bandanna, and told him that it belonged to the DeNasty clan, and that his ancestor helped defeat Dracula. Armund decided to leave his life on the high seas to seek out more answers about his ancestry.

Romania, 1800. It's been 3 years since Alucard defeated his father in battle and has gone into eternal slumber. Armund's search has taken him to the mountains of Romania, not far from the town of Jova. A mysterious letter hinted that he might be able to find answers in the castle of Count Olrox, a servant of Count Dracula's. Armund set out of Olrox's castle, armed only with an enchanted barbed rope from Serbia. This will truly be the greatest and most arduous adventure of Armund DeNasty's life.

    <desc>Description:

This patch fixes a small number of graphical oversights in Castlevania III. Most of these are related from reusing graphics from the first Castlevania game but forgetting to reorder two colors in their palette. Whether these are actually bugs is debatable, I made this patch for my own personal use but decided to release it publicly. The archive also includes a patch to use uncensored graphics in CV3 and a few patches for Akumajo Densetsu.

Bugfixes:

- Holy Water: In CV3 this suffers from two colors being reversed, in Akumajo Densetsu it is missing a color entirely.
- Candlestand: Suffers from two colors being reversed. Possibly intentional, it still looks good this way.
- Rosary: Better known as the Cross, this is the item that kills every enemy onscreen. It had two of its colors reversed.
- Money Bag: In CV1 two of the money bags use a dark colored bag with a light colored dollar sign, the other reverses the colors. CV3's money bags all use a light bag with a dark dollar sign, this reverses the colors in CV3.
- Points: The points when you pick up a money bag or kill more than one enemy with a subweapon were light-colored in CV1 and future CV titles, leading me to believe the blue numbers in CV3 were a mistakethey do look better, however.
- Censored Graphics: All are related to topless women, mostly just statues except for Medusa, who was made a male in CV3.

It's a cursed world we live in (thanks to Drac!)

The time is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. The moon burns red overhead and black clouds loom large on the horizon. All is still and quiet. Only the call of a distant crow stirs the cold night air. Suddenly, thunder roars out of the Morbid Mountains and into the village of Warakiya. Like the yell of an angry giant, the terrible sound shakes homes and shops as if they were sapling branches.

But no one blinks an eye. The village is dead calm. For all the people have fled after receiving warnings from the Great Beyond that Count Dracula has assembled a mighty army of evil, and they're poised to march up from the Valley of Graveyards to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Unfortunately, there's no corner on Earth that won't be gobbled up by this bloodthirsty legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead.

The last line of defense is you, Trevor Belmont - the forefather of Simon Belmont and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. But your chances are slimmer than Jim. In fact, the only real edge you have over this fang sharpened freak is your power to transform into three different partner spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. Each of these spirits will confront you as you fight through 17 possible levels of never-ending fright, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. You must also possess the strength to wield the mighty Battle Axe and Mystic Whip, which were given to you by the Poltergeist King.

So go forth young Trevor into the cold black night, where death lurks around every corner and evil lingers on every stone. And remember, if your courage and cunning are any less than magnificent or if you fail to choose the correct Paths of Fate, you'll be banished to the world of the undead, and zombies will rule until the end of time.

--From the NES Castlevania 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Castlevania 3 was probably my favorite Castlevania game growing up. It returned to the gameplay in the first one. It was more like an adventure game than the RPG-like gameplay of the second one. The biggest difference was the ability to change into other characters. I think the best character is Grant because he can climb on the walls and his jumping ability is far superior to the others. The only weakness he has is the fact that his attack is shorter and does less damage, but if you need a longer more powerful attack you can just switch back to Belmont.

The graphics looked good, with detailed backgrounds. The background music is catchy and pleasant. Castlevania 3 is a lot of fun, and I suggest you give it a try.

Directions:

Enter your name and start the game. The object of the game will be to fight your way to and defeat Dracula. Most levels will have a boss to beat at the end. Sometimes you will be asked to choose between two paths after beating a level.

All roads lead to Dracula, so it won't matter too much which way you choose.

All of the characters have a primary and secondary attack. Your primary attack will differ depending on which character you are. The secondary attacks will be the same depending on what weapon you've picked up. Pressing up and attack will fire your secondary weapon. The axe travels in an arc. The dagger flies straight. The boomerang also flies straight, but will also return to you for another chance at hitting your enemy. The holy water flies in a much smaller arc and lands on the floor to make a little fire that may have your enemies running into it for multiple hits. The clock will stop all enemies in their tracks for a few seconds. There is a double shot(II) and triple shot(III) you can find that will allow you to fire two or three shots at a time. You will also need hearts to fire your secondary weapon. 

All of the weapons will take one heart from you when you use them except for the clock, which will cost you five. You may find these in candles. A small heart will be worth one and a big heart is worth five. Also found in candles are the weapons themselves, meat, and whip upgrades. Meat will refill your life. The first whip upgrade you get will turn your whip from leather to chain. The next one will make it a little longer. The long chain whip is the best you can get. Also found in candles, are cross pendants. As soon as you pick up one of these, the screen will flash, destroying all enemies on that screen.

There are three alternate characters in the game. Grant is the first you will meet. After you fight and beat him, his ghost will offer to come with you. If you choose to let him, you will be able to transform into him by pressing Select. When you are Grant, your ability to jump will be improved, and you will be able to climb walls and ceilings. On the downside, his primary attack is short and weak. The second ghost you will encounter is Sypha. He will offer to help you after you defeat the Cyclops. Sypha is a wizard that can find a spell book in a candle, so that his primary weapon will be a fireball. This is the only good thing about Sypha. His jump is the same as Belmont's and without the book he has a very short range on his primary weapon. Alucard is Dracula's brother, and after you fight him, his ghost will offer his services. While playing as Alucard, you will able to turn into a bat. While you are a bat, your hearts will diminish. When you run out, you will turn back into human form, so be sure you are 
not over a pit when that happens. Alucard also has a short primary attack and jumps just like Belmont. You may only have one ghost with you at a time, so choose wisely.

    <desc>Castlevania 3...the best NES Castlevania game since the original Castlevania. The Japanese version here happens to have a bit of an edge over it's American port in the form of the VRC6 chip, which does most of its job improving the sound quality to that which would have given competition to the likes of the Sega Mark 3 (Japanese Master System) and the MSX2. Alas, most likely due to expense costs, the US Castlevania 3 never saw the VRC6, and in Japan, only three other games were ever given such an improvement.

Translation Description:

I'm certain we have a hack of Akamajou Densetsu somewhere around here, but unlike that patch, which was just the english script cut-n'-pasted into the Japanese ROM, this one's from scratch, translated from the original script. Of course, this also means the original names apply (Trevor Belmont is now Ralph Belmond), but also gone are the dubious errors ("Bad world full of evil"). But yeah, whether be it Trevor,Ralph, Bad world or evil, Akamajou Densetsu is a game to play. Only now there's no Nintendo censorship to get in the way of things. Wee! Version 1.0 features a title screen replacement courtesy of BMF54123.

The second coming of Count Dracula

You're Simon Belmont, bravest of the brave, boldest of the bold, a gothic warrior respected by kings.

You earned your praise, not by crushing Viking invaders or Turkish hordes, but by destroying the evil Count Dracula in a duel to the death at Castlevania. But your victory proved painful, as the wounds inflicted during the duel slowly gnawed at your soul.

One day, though, a beautiful maiden appeared. With a soft voice she warned that you were possessed by the Count's curse. She said your only hope of destroying the curse and healing your scars was to find the five body parts of Count Dracula and burn them all in his Castle, ending forever the reign of the Prince of Darkness.

Suddenly, like most beautiful visions, she began to fade. And as you reached to touch her, she spoke her final words -

"Fear not, brave Simon, for if you have the courage to risk your life, you will find the strength to win again."

--From the NES Castlevania 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest was initially panned upon its release, many reviewers didn't like how Konami toyed with the classic linear style that the original "Castlevania" had, but it turns out that hindsight truly is 20/20.

I'll give the initial reviews the fact that the game is a heck of a lot more challenging, that's undeniable, but I really don't believe in panning a game that is bigger (in both size and concept) and generally has a lot more to offer the player than its predecessor.

The game world is huge and brimming with (un)life, it even has a functioning day and night cycle (during night, the enemies become even MORE challenging than they are during the day).

The graphics and sound are passable, if unspectacular, which is the only major complaint I had with this game, but I found those complaints moot whenever I saw the size of the world. I figured the developers had to tone back on some things in order to get the game to fit on the SNES cartridge.

If you want to witness the birth of the first true "non-linear action game," then look no further than "Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest." It's fun, challenging and rewarding, which are the qualities that all video games should strive to have.

Directions:

The game doesn't really mess with the Castlevania formula like many have said; it only makes it bigger and more challenging.

The basic gameplay amounts to entering a new area, killing the monsters in the said area and repeating that process until you finally reach Dracula.

You can buy potions and other items from vendors in the game's towns, which will help you in many ways, shapes and forms.

Like I've said before, the game is challenging, and unlike the rest of the games in the series, it almost forces you to avoid combat with enemies instead of taking them on full force (which is due to the curse that Dracula put on Simon at the end of the original Castlevania). But the satisfaction you'll get from clearing an area is almost unrivaled in gaming, it honestly feels like you've accomplished something while sitting in your computer chair and doing what amounts to twiddling your thumbs.

Good Eeeevening!

Step into the shadows of the deadliest dwelling on earth. You've arrived at Castlevania, and you're here on business:
To destroy forever the Curse of the Evil Count.

Unfortunately, everybody's home this evening. Bats, ghosts, every kind of creature you can imagine. You'll find 'em all over the place, if they don't find you first.

Because you've got to get through six monstrous floors before you even meet up with the Master of the House. Your Magic Whip will help, and you'll probably find a weapon or two along the way.

But once you make it to the tower, you can count on a Duel to the Death. The Count has waited 100 years for a rematch. He's ready. Are you?

--From the NES Castlevania instruction manual.

Overview:

Castlevania is a cornerstone game for Konami and Nintendo. The story and gameplay of this game were uncomparable to most games of the time. Who wouldn't want to save the world from evil by defeating the infamous Dracula? Although this game was very tough, it was a whole lot of fun. The graphics were well-rendered, and the controls were a little hard to get used to, but responsive none the less. The game consists of eighteen stages filled with ghouls, ghosts and famous monsters such as Frankenstein, the Hunchback, Medusa, Hell Hounds, the Grim Reaper, and of course, Dracula. Castlevania is an action packed ride through some of the most famous monster stories of all time, so pop your fingers and get ready to get blisters on your thumbs, 'cause this game is not for amateurs.

Directions:

Save the town of Transylvania from the evil of Count Dracula, by fighting your way through all seven levels. There is a boss at the end of each with Dracula waiting for you in the last one.

There are several items of interest in Castlevania. Meat will refill your hit points upon grabbing it. There are also bags of money that will give you extra points when you get them. Sometimes, you can find a hidden crown that will also add points. A cross will destroy all enemies on the screen. The potion will make you invincible for a short time. There are several weapons you can find. Your whip can be upgraded twice by finding a whip power-up. The first time it will go from a leather whip to a chain whip. The next time, it will be upgraded to a longer chain whip.

A small heart will give you a heart, while a big one will give you five. Hearts give you the ability to use your secondary weapon. All of the secondary weapons use one heart per throw, except the watch. It will use five. The dagger will fly straight and true when thrown. The axe will fly in an arch at your enemies, which is good for enemies that attack from the sky. The boomerang will fly straight, then come back to you for a second chance to hit your enemy. Holy water will be thrown in a much smaller arch than the axe, and upon landing, will break out into a fire that will damage enemies until it burns out. The watch will freeze all enemies on the screen for a few seconds. Each weapon can be thrown one at a time until you find a double or a triple shot. A double shot looks like the roman numeral II, and allows you to fire two at a time. A triple shot is a III and allows you to fire three at a time.

    <desc>Hack of first Castlevania game by Morgoth Galaxius using Kent Hansen's CV1edit and Tile Layer Pro. The general layout of the levels remains the same, except the location of the blocks and candles has changed and the background has changed. The location of enemies remains the same. Some of the item sprites have been replaced with other sprites, usually sprites that were from the original ROM but never made it in the game.

Of special note is the Red Axe subweapon, which has replaced the Ax subweapon. It does not use any hearts and it is possible to throw it and whip simultaneously. It is not possible to gain double or triple shots with this subweapon, however.

The following items have been replaced with the following sprites:

- Meat -&gt; Basket
- Crucifix -&gt; White Bible
- Invisibility Jar -&gt; Love Letter
- Crown -&gt; Slippers
- Treasure Chest -&gt; Coffee Cup
- Boomerang -&gt; Cross from Vampire Killer

    <desc>Castlevania Remix is a hack of Castlevania which incorporates the use of a few simple tones for the palette in order to create a bit of a sepia/black-and-white quality to the game, which lends itself very well to Castlevania, making it look more like a silver-age era monster film, which is definitely where the idea for Castlevania originated. Some might scoff at the use of a palette like this, but making the graphics look this detailed on the NES with a small set of colors is no small feat.

Besides the graphical changes, the level layouts are also changed, and in some spots it's a lot more difficult, and in others it's easier. One thing to watch out for, though, is a distinct lack of hearts, which makes bosses a lot harder to defeat since you will only get off a few shots with your weapons before having to resort to your whip. Oh, and also be on the look-out for camoflaged staircases in a few spots if you can't find them, you may find yourself stuck.

Also of interest is that the soundtrack has been rearranged slightly, and in some spots modifiedbut the sound hacks still need a little work. Perhaps in a future version.

    <desc>Castlevania Retold isas the name suggesta retelling of the original NES Castlevania. I wanted to keep the original story intact (Many of the CV games are retellings of the first one, this is no different) but offer new levels and graphics, this is just that. All the levels have the same themes to them they originally had, but with new layouts and enemy placement, I also wanted to keep the classic feel to it, which is why I used mostly graphics from CV2 and 3. There are very few custom graphics in the hack, I'm not good with graphics at all, but I did make a new title screen using the new CV logo (Which Moonchile later enhanced) and enhanced some of the orignal sprits. Any Castlevania fan will probably like this, but until recently I didn't notice it's one downside: It's hard. As I made this hack I pretty much learned how everything in CV's game engine works, the exact timing of enemies and such. 

So, while I can play through most of it with no problems even my friends who are good at Castlevania die several times on the first level.

This game is the predecessor of Bubble Bobble and it's a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas. The Monstas hatch from eggs at the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The eggs have three phases: if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an eggs turns red it will pop almost immediately. Chack'n uses bombs to release the en-caged hearts and to blow up the Monstas. When the heart is released it will fly up and destroy the separator block between the level and the Mighta. Go to the Mighta and you are in the next level. After 14 levels there's a wedding between Mr. and Mrs. Chack'n.

Times were once serene in the lush lands of Lorin, long before technology and evil....the evil necromancer Deniwind that is. As a child, this seemingly harmless soul spent his time idly whittling away the hours with magically insignificant spells. Young Deniwind would make an egg float here, a chicken there, or simply conjure a lizard man or two to do this chores for him. Then disaster and puberty struck, rendering young Deniwind a walking testosterone magic machine with an eye for mischief. Some would maintain that wiping out entire villages by accident on purpose was more than mischief!

Main Characters:

Sir Burkelot - The main character who grew up learning dragon style kung fu. With a funny name which bears a similarity to Dan Burke.

Lady Ninita - Your girlfriend who has been kidnapped by the evil wizard Deniwind. The name bears a resemblance also to Nina Stanley who worked on many Color Dreams titles.

Deniwind - The main antagonist of the game. An evil wizard who took your girlfriend.

Championship Bowling is one of the only bowling games on the NES. It's a lot of fun and the graphics aren't too bad either. It lets you decide where to bowl from and how much curve you put on the ball. The controls are pretty easy to figure out. The sounds are annoying. Especially the sound it makes when the pins get hit, it's too high pitched. The music wasn't bad though. The gameplay is kinda boring because even though the game is called Championship Bowling, there is no circuit to bowl in or anything. All you can do is bowl by yourself and see how high a score you can get, or bowl against some of your friends. The only thing that really saved the game was the ability to play with four people. It was good to play at a party. If you like bowling be sure to try this game.

Directions:

Play Bowling alone or with friends in this bowling game. Pick your bowler and ball, then bowl your best game. Move your bowler to the desired lane position, then press A to start your spin meter. Press A again to stop the spin meter. The farther it is to one side, the more it will curve in that direction. If you can stop it in the middle, it won't curve at all. After that, the power meter will start. The higher you stop it, the harder your bowler will throw the ball.

Controls:

A Button: Throw
B Button: Show Score
Start Button: N/A

Hints:

Strike Zone
- Remember that the strike zone is just to the left or right of the center pin.

A follow-up to the original Lode Runner, with identical gameplay. This package contained 50 of the most challenging levels ever designed, and was intended for expert players only. It did not include the level editor, you had to play through the levels in order, but a save-game option was provided (although you lost one life every time you restored).

There were plans for a sequel to The Cheetahmen. Although completed, Cheetahmen II was ultimately left officially unreleased. However, in 1997 all 1,500 known copies of the game were located in a warehouse, and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges with some having a small gold sticker reading "Cheetahmen II". The cartridge is very hard to come by, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet.

In Cheetahmen II the player assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo and Hercules), and upon defeating an enemy boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels as in the Action 52 version. Due to a bug, it is impossible to gain access to the levels in which one assumes the role of Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or being the lucky recipient of a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.

Cheetahmen II is famous for its lack of quality; it is reputed by many in the gaming community to be nearly unplayable, and was rumored to have been produced extremely quickly, with no debugging attempted. Like Action 52 it was not licensed by Nintendo.

Among NES fans, the two Cheetahmen games are renowned for being among the all-time worst games ever made for that system, though the characters themselves gained a huge cult following afterwards. Cheetahmen II in particular is buggy, incomplete, and widely regarded as virtually unplayable.

CAN YOU BEAT THE CHESS MASTER?

A fun and very addicting chess game. Try to beat the chess master. This is a very basic game with only two buttons. 1-2 players can play at one time.
Pretty good graphics for 1989, but the game makes a very annoying beep BEEP BEEP beep noise whenever you make a move.

Directions:

Move the arrow keys and press B to pick up a chess piece and move it in a legal way. Press B again to let go of the chess piece.

Press SELECT to access in-game options such as begin new game, change sides, play against another human, change difficulty, and change view.

Controls:

A Button: N/A
B Button: Grab/Release piece
Start Button: N/A
Select Button: Options Menu

    <desc>This seems like a kinda spiffy side-scrolling adventure romp in the vein of Zelda 2, Faxanadu, or Battle of Olympus. Most of the game revolves around jumping and stabbing and exploring. Of course, you run into people along the way who try to pawn their advice and goods off on you. And I think you're looking for some treasure or something. It'd be great if this game had a backstory!

Translation Description:

Well, Gideon is pretty sure that everything is fully translated. Nobody can get past Stage 6 (hell, I can't get past Stage 1), so he wasn't able to check any further than that. But as far as he knows, it's all done, bug free, and grammatically koescher.

Fat Cat has broken out from prison and flicked the Urn of the Pharaoh. Chip and Dale must assemble the Rescue Rangers and try to recover the urn. They must explore eight levels that include a downtown restaurant, a giant refrigerator, a haunted warehouse, and Fat Cats secret headquarters. Based on the Disney animated series; eight levels; unique challenges and enemies; variety of secret areas; two-player simultaneous support.

This game was slightly superior graphically Rescue Rangers, and it featured additional incentives for cooperative play such mini-games that can only be unlocked with two players and the ability to throw your partner as a weapon.

    <desc>This game is so ridiculously easy ... it's ridiculous! It's a platformer, where you can choose which stage you want to play, then play through with one of five characters. There's really no difference between the characters, except that two are armed with a sword, two are armed with a gun, and one is armed with their fist (although I guess that would make them unarmed). It really makes no difference, though. A blind, lame, mentally deficient mule could beat this game. But that's not to say the game is bad though. Just easy. It also looks like it's based on an anime or something, due to the fact that the characters combine and transform into a transformer-looking giant robot. You don't see that very often in an Nes game unless it's based on something. Unfortunately, there is so little text in the game, it never really explains it. Either way, if you like platformers, give it a try.

Translation Description:

The game should be fully playable, not that it mattered, because this is one of those games you really don't need to be able to read. Yes, there is that little text in it. So enjoy. La.

    <desc>I love this game! It's one of those games that really should have been brought over here. But it doesn't matter now, does it? Hahahaha! Anyway this here's an action-RPG-type thing. It's kind of hard to explain.. Which is why we have screenshots! It's really fun, and innovative in a lot of ways. It has an overall excellent plot, and is in my opinion one of the best NES games out there. Well, it would be if it weren't for one small detail. If you've played it before you know exactly what I'm talking about. That's right, the AI. Since this is an action RPG thing, you only control one character, and the game's AI takes control of the others (up to four). And those guys do really really stupid things. I could write an entire page about how incredibly bad this game's AI is, but I won't. I'm too sleepy. Anyway, go play dammit!

Translation Description:

The translation is beautifully done, perfect enough to make a grown man weep. Seriously, EVERYONE needs to play this.

Chubby Cherub is the English title of the Japanese Famicom video game Obake no Q-taro: WanWan Panic. It was heavily modified for its United States release by the FCC and retitled Chubby Cherub.

The North American Chubby Cherub game is about a flying cupid who eats food and attacks enemies with limited supplies of hearts. The Japanese game is about a ghost named Q-tar?, a character from a Fujiko Fujio manga series called Obake no Q-tar?

Story:

Chubby Cherub's friends are kidnapped by several burglars. Chubby Cherub has to save them, however many dogs are in the wayChubby Cherub's one fear as a ghost. Chubby Cherub has to cross 12 levels, at the end of each, the protagonist will find his friends. Eating food maintains Chubby Cherub's flight. If the flying meter goes all the way down, the character will have to stay on ground. The character will bark at the dogs before they bark at the character; if a bark hits the character, the character may die.

    <desc>All right, before this review even begins, I want to get one thing out of the way. I suck. A lot. Maybe I suck at this game, maybe just shooters, maybe just games in general. The fact remains that I suck. Okay. As you can guess, this is a nice little shooter game. And it's very well done too, unlike most shooters you see out there these days. And by that I mean mostly Action 52 and Color Dreams games. But there are lots of bad ones, just none come to mind. Anyway, you shoot stuff. And it's hard. To me. One hit kills you, and throws you back to either the midpoint or the beginning. It's just like R-Type, only a lot harder because the game's so cutesy and you KNOW you can beat this silly little cutesy game to a pathetic bloody pulp with your mad gaming skillz, but you just CAN'T. But maybe that's just me. Oh, and there's some slowdown. Pretty cool. And the backgrounds look really neat! Okay I'm done.

Description:

Um, there's probably some text in here that's been translated. I can't beat stage 1, so I don't know too much about what's been done. Bah. Who knows.

Based on the 1984 Konami "Circus Charlie" coin-op. A single player platform adventure. Your sister is kidnapped while at the circus and it is your job to find her. Travel through different parts of the circus and pick up different weapons by punching enemies.

You start out in the game with little life, and few weapons, but you can collect various icons to increase how many direct hits you can take, keys to open doors, along with various circus items to shot as projectives.

Hints:

Many of the levels can be avoided all together by just walking backwards and back through the curtain from where you start. This will take you right to that level's boss battle.

You are Charlie, a member of a circus troupe. Your job is to please the crowd by performing five death-defying stunts:

Stunt #1: You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire. Remember to avoid the jugs that emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters.

Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan monkeys for 500 points.

Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground.

Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse.

Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing.

Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.

The main character of City Connection drives a Honda City and is on a tour around the world, viewing all the sites each city has to offer.

In order to prove that he has been to each place, he must drive on each part of the road in each location, painting it white. This is of course vandalism, so naturally the police are out to stop you.

The backgrounds are very distinctive and show some obvious landmarks, so you can tell where you are. Maybe they were trying to get across a bit of geographic education with this game. You can kinda tell where they were going with the music. It definitely sets the mood for the places you're in, it's the same tune but played in a different way on different levels.

Directions:

So you just have to drive over every part of the level, not the most complicated objective. Other than police cars, which vary in size from level to level, there's also random spikes that come out of the floor, and what I can only guess is a naked guy with a checkered flag who kills you on contact.

There are also oil cans to collect, which increase your bonus multiplier at the end of the level. They can also be used as weapons.

You're given 3 lives to start with. When you touch enemies you explode, and hearts rain down from the sky. Crazy.

The 2 Player mode is not too different from 1st player mode: You take turns each level, and when you crash, it is the other player's turn. The levels aren't co-operative, so one of you could be on level 5 and the other could be on level 1. The winner is the person who's furthest into the game before they run out of lives. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot oil cans
Up+A Jump up one platform

Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s, and this game was adapted from that television program.

Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes ("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example), and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again. As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.

Based on the 1993 action/adventure film starring Sylvester Stallone. 

Plot:

A plane filled with terrorists attempting to steal money from a treasury plane while airborne is shot down by an FBI plane. The terrorists survive and send out a distress signal, which the main character, Gabe, responds to. However, Gabe does not know that the mayday signal is coming from a group of terrorists, and after reaching them, the terrorists capture Gabe's partner, Hal, and hold him hostage. Gabe must then set out and retrieve the money in order to save Hal.

Gameplay:

The game begins with Gabe responding to the call, before Hal being captured. In order to progress through the game, the player must watch out for enemies and either avoid them by jumping or defeat them by attacking with various weapons, such as a knife or a gun. There are also bosses after every few levels, the final boss being Qualen, the leader of the terrorist group.

Clu Clu Land's story starts with a type of Sea Urchin, the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the hero, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the golden Ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. The golden Ingots usually form an outline of something, such as a heart or a mushroom. There are Turning Posts throughout the stage, and that's the only way Bubbles can turn around to go to another side. Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they're stunned, Bubbles can push them into the wall to get rid of them and receive points.

In later levels, the player has to pass over the gold Ingots twice to uncover them, and passing over them in later levels will re-bury them.

Game Review by Santulli Slant:

This game tries hard to be everything BUT unique. Power it up and it plays quite a bit like the classic Choplifter. All of this under a decidedly Metal Gear presentation. Despite its efforts to imitate, it stands fairly well on its own.

    <desc>This game got its fame mostly through its place at Ballzysoft (ages and ages ago.. for the uninformed, this was Ballz's ancient rom site (partially), long since abandoned). Since Ballz couldn't understand it, he was very scared by it. I played the untranslated rom quite a while ago, and I really can't blame him. Now that Akujin translated it, I've found that it's actually a pretty neat game. Turns out it's not just some freaky elephant's acid trip, but a Dream World of sorts. The real charm in the game comes from the customization of your heroes. You get up to four or five at the end, I think, but you typically just use one of them the whole time. Despite it looking all cutesy and stuff, don't be fooled.. This game can be harder than hell sometimes. Give it a try though, you'll probably be surprised at how neat this is.

Translation Description:

Akujin did this translation. It's very nice. And, um, everybody says stuff in English. Sweet!

The game borrows an extremely heavy influence from the classic arcade game Rolling Thunder, down to the concept of ducking into doors to hide or pick up ammunition, and nearly identical-looking enemies whose abilities can only be told apart from the color of their outfits.

Now children ages 3 to 6 (or adults who don't want to miss out on all the fun) can spend hours of imaginative play coloring, patterning and creating dozens of bright, colorful dinosaurs... from the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex to the lovable Triceratops, flying Pterodactyl and gigantic Brontosaurus - and many more. Youngsters can choose from among 16 different dinosaur outlines to decorate with 4 palettes, 11 colors and 9 patterns.

    <desc>It's... a role playing game! Set in what I can only assume to be the time period of Columbus! Due to my limited knowledge of Japanese, that's about all I know about the game. Oh, and the combat is really weird, like Lunar, only you take a step and your turn ends. You've got to admit it's clever, so maybe one day this will be translated, or something. Yeah.

Translated Description:

This is a complete patch for Columbus. Some minor changes were added to this patch version - see readme for more details.

    <name>Conquest of the Crystal Palace</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Fifteen years ago The Crystal Palace was a thriving kingdom. The people of The Crystal Palace prospered and all things great and small were treated equal. During this time lived a kind and gentle ruler who encouraged the people to be honest and fair; his name was Bretor. Bretor was famous throughout the world for his achievements. The King's wife, Queen Zyla, gave birth to a son. His name was Prince Farron.

Tales of this kingdom spread far and near and people soon flocked to The Crystal Palace seeking citizenship. The Kingdom of The Crystal Palace became very populated with people of all races.

One day as a Dysonian man was telling a group of people about The Crystal Palace, Zaras, an evil war-spirit of the East, became interested in the story.

Zaras was a terrible War Spirit of the 20th Century with great power. Zaras was capable of taking any shape or form and was thought to be indestructible.

Zaras appeared one day and simulated an army of evil guardians who eventually took control of The Crystal Palace. King Bretor was eliminated in a flash and so was Queen Zyla. The people of The Crystal Palace were transported to the stars and areas of the sky not seen before. Eventually, there were only two people left for Zaras to deal with; Prince Farron and Zapolis, the palace guardian and keeper. Farron was transformed into a 6 month old baby and Zapolis was turned into a dog. Farron called him Zap.

The Crystal Palace became an evil lair of mazes and chambers filled with goons and henchmen of Zaras' imagination.

Zap watched over Farron and insured his safety. When Farron turned 15 years old, he and Zap set out for The Crystal Palace. Their goal and your challenge is to restore the peace and unity once felt by the people before The Conquest of the Crystal Palace.

--From the NES Conquest of Crystal Palace instruction manual.

Overview:

Growing up in a crystal palace must have been fun for Farron (Pleeeease don't throw anything heavy). But when the Evil Zaras invaded and killed his family when he was just a kid, he fled with the palace guardian, a dog named Zap (wonderful Guardian). But now, Farron is the mature age of 15 (no wait, that can't be right) and he and his dog are going back to the Crystal Mountain to destroy Zaras for his evil wicked naughty ways.

Conquest of the Crystal Palace was a fun game, full of action and dynamic game-play. At the time, the graphics were great, with top-notch music and sound effects as well. From a player's point of view, I used to spend hours a day playing it. This game will suck you in like an industrial strength vacuum cleaner. Enjoy!

Directions:

Play Farron in this side-scrolling adventure to reclaim the Crystal Palace from the clutches of the evil war spirit Zaras, who conquered the kingdom long ago and filled it with his goons. The Palace has become a twisted maze of Zaras' imagination, filled with traps and dead ends.

But don't feel like it's just you against the world, you are accompanied by your trusty guardian, Zap the dog. Zap will run around and kill the enemies that you miss, but be careful because his life will gradually go down, and when it's gone you can't call him back until it's full again.

Also, every so often you will come across Kim, a young girl who sells you health and upgrades to your weaponry; such as fire balls you can shoot at your enemies, or boots that make you jump higher. To pay for these upgrades, you have to collect the coins that are left behind when you kill enemies.

All in all, this is a wonderful game that is packed full of action. I truly hope you enjoy playing it.

Remember that time where all the popular Street Fighter characters, led by Ryu. Put aside all their differences. Learned to use guns, and fought in a mission deep in the jungle to protect the free world from Cobra?

Wasn't that great!?

Or it could just be a Pirate hack of the NES "G.I. Joe" game.

An update of the Contra series featuring new characters with different capabilities, and the ability to switch between characters to use their specialty skills when needed. Take Contra Force for a spin today!

Neo City, not long ago voted most livable city in the U.S., has fallen into the hands of D.N.M.E., immortal scum whose reign of terror has left no one untouched.

In their most recent caper, D.N.M.E. has kidnapped the city's chief commissioner. His only hope is C-Force, an independent law enforcement group made up of National Special Force alumnni.

But bringing down D.N.M.E. won't be EZ. It'll take cleverness, creativity and calculated risks. But then, they don't call them the C-Force for nothing.</desc>

Sipping cold lemonade with a couple of native lovelies, Mad Dog and Scorpion (Guerrilla Warriors Extraordinaire) relax on a Rio beach and boast of how they destroyed the vile alien war monger, Red Falcon. Little do they know that Red Falcon didn't flee with his pointed tail between his legs. Instead, he tactically retreated to round-up ruffians of the universe, friends from all walks of war, to mount a second assault on planet Earth.

One of these new recruits is Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy, who dishes out punishment with a laser sharp tongue. Red Falcon has also shuttled in The Babalu Bestructoid Mechanism, a giant alien attack tank, which was the primary weapon used to disintegrate the innocent solar system of Tralala.

But the genius behind the Red Falcon's Earth conquering concept is his plan to have thousands of intergalactic warriors seep into the the brains of the U.S. Army. It's a mind contamination trick which has already taken command of U.S. Forces at Fort Fire Storm.

How do we know that all our soldiers have been brain trashed? You can see it in their eyes.

Now, if Mad Dog and Scorpion fail to recuperate from their months on the beach in time to destroy Red Falcon's G.I. fortified Hate Nest, his sinister scheme will permeate the world's mightiest power (nuclear missile silos included).

And if that happens, we'll all be pushing up daisies.

--From the NES Contra Super C instruction manual.

Overview:

Super C, the sequel to the very well known NES game Contra, was a decent addition to the series. Played much like its predecessor, this installment of the series had no new weapons or features other than the addition of a few top view levels. So Contra and Super C are almost identical in the realms of game-play, controls, graphics, and sound. If you have played one of them you pretty much have played both. Not to say Super C was bad, but not a giant leap from the original.

Directions:

You must keep moving ahead, while you avoid being hit or shot by anything that comes your way. You can eliminate these beings by simply killing them with your gun.

During the game, you can shoot at flying objects that will drop a power up. These power ups will improve your weapon, by upgrading them to a better type of gun such as flame throwers, machine guns, lasers guns, even split shot guns!

There are two types of levels: Side-scrolling levels, and up and down view levels. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Select 1 or 2 players

Hints:

Ten lives
- Press Right, Left, Down, Up, A, B at the title screen. Then, press Start for a one player game or Select, Start for a two player game.

    <desc>Well damn, what more can you say about this game? It's Contra! It kicks ass! There's a flimsy plotline in the Japanese version! The 30-man code still works! Seriously, this game is a blast.. I'm sure everyone knows that though. This is of course the Japanese release of Contra, and there are some extra bonus things that don't really amount to much in the end, but they're still pretty cool, and they make you wonder why Konami took that stuff out of the U.S. release. Anyway, go play dammit! And get a second player, for God's sake.. It's twice as fun!

Translation Description:

The MadHacker calls this Gryzor, for reasons mentioned in the readme. I'd go with Gryzor too, if nothing more than the fact that it has a cooler title screen.

There's two patches. One is for Contra, the other for Gryzor. The only differences are in the title screen and some slight text changes due to the name change. (This is the Contra Version)

    <desc>Blegh.. Well I played this for about a minute before giving up. It's a strategy game, set in space, and that's pretty much enough to turn me off. Overlord has scarred me for life, I'm afraid. There's probably some cool fighting and stuff, but it's just too much effort I think.

Translation Description:

This patch isn't quite complete, but you won't notice any gibberish until about four or five hundred hours into the game. Give or take. That's literally, according to blibber.

    <desc>Cosmo Police Galivan is simply the epitome of "badass". In Jair's own words, "This game is a nifty platform RPG that's sort of like a cross between Metroid and Strider, but cooler." In my own words, "Konami completely ripped off this game when they were making the gameplay engine for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night." Anyway, if those descriptions don't help you, the gist of the game is that you run around in a side-scrolling environemnt, kicking the crap out of bad guys with sword, and finding items so that you may advance farther  items that make you jump higher, better weapons, etc. All while you level up in a standard RPG expereince system. It's a really fun game, and you're really missing out if you don't find the ROM and try it out.

Translation Description:

Jair's translation is simply lovely, and I think that everyone can stand and applaud him for such a fine job. No really, it's great! Really great!

Think The Legend of Zelda set in the Old West, and you'll get a good idea of what Cowboy Kid is like. You play the title character, a loner who drifts into town with nothing but the shirt on his back, given a choice of six mean hombres to bring to justice. The action is similar to a fast moving side-scrolling combat game, but RPG staples such as shops, items and character interaction play an important role. Some aspects of the game seem a bit buggy, such as questionable hit detection and treasure chests that refill when they scroll off-screen, but the cartoonish graphics, fun mini-games and distinctly themed gameplay make Cowboy Kid a winner.

In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.

Theodore "Todd" Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by Jeff "Crash" Cooney and his band of misfits from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to challenge Crash and his friends to a contest. Inviting two of the other high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against his cross-town rival.

Gameplay:

The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend.

There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurtles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place.

The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.

    <desc>First off, let me say that I am not at all a fan of Crayon Shin-Chan. At all. It's this manga that seems tailor-made for giggling twelve-year-olds, and it ends up being completely juvenile and insipid to anyone else who reads it, unlike cool children's books, like The Monster at the End of This Book. God damn, that was an awesome book. How could you not love that? Anyways yeah, maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this. Or playing it.

So this game is a weird versus puzzle-type game where you push blocks of two into a playing field, with the goal of getting them all on your opponent's side, or something like that. It all seems pretty silly and random to me.

Not much is translated, just various graphics, and a chunk of the first scenario thingy.

As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down. While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

- Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
- Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
- Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
- Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
- Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
- King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes.

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.

THE STORY OF CRYSTALIS

It has been said that an ending is merely a beginning in disguise. And so it was that when the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in the dawn of a new era. An era in which science and technology were shunned - for they had proven to be mankind's downfall - and the ancient arts of sorcery and magic were revived.

As the survivors slowly rebuilt their world, towns and villages began to spring up, and the wisest and most capable of the magicians used their magic to keep order. Peace reigned over the land for a hundred years... Until a powerful Magician named Draygon intrigued by the forbidden ways of science, began to study the principles of machines and flying. Realizing the power he might wield if he combined his magic with technology, his mind became twisted by the urge to control and dominate his fellow man.

Draygon created a computer capable of simulating his magic powers. He placed it in a floating fortified tower; and from his airborne fortress, he built and controlled his growing empire, until the entire planet was threatened by his ever spreading evil.

In a attempt to combat Draygon, the other magicians constructed a series of powerful swords, along with powerful items to use with these swords. Based on the basic elements of the land - wind, fire, water, and thunder - the four swords if used together at full power, would transform into the next elemental stage - that of crystal. This would be the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis.

Learning of their idea, Draygon seized the weapons; but they had made them too well, and he was unable to destroy them. Knowing they could only defeat him if used together, Draygon scattered the weapons throughout the land, and stripped the wise magicians of most of their powers.

In desperation, they began to study the writings from the time of the Great War, where they learned of a great magician, the most powerful who ever lived. He had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen by the evil forces of the Great War, who had hoped to use his powers to control the world after the war. Searching the globe, the wise men found the cave, and were amazed to find that the mighty magician frozen within was a mere lad.

Through they knew it might destroy them, they pooled all of their remaining power in an attempt to will him back to life. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world.

--From the NES Crystalis instruction manual.

Overview:

In Crystalis the world was almost totally destroyed. The destruction caused many people of the world to be mutated. The few people that made it started to rebuild their cities and homes. You wake up from a cryogenic sleep to find the world you remember to be in shambles. You learn that the Empire of Dragonia is evil and must be stopped.

The graphics in this game were excellent. They did quite well despite the limitations of the eight-bit Nintendo. This was a very challenging and fun gaming experience.

Directions:

Collect all four swords(Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder) to form the Crystalis sword, and save the world.

This game reminds most people of the Zelda games. The environment is much the same. You go through towns talking to townsfolk and learning information and getting items. Then, of course, you go out to the wilderness to battle evil. As you defeat enemies you will gain experience and money. You can use money to buy items that will help on your journey. 

Controls:

A Button: Use magic, Jump, Select item
B Button: Attack (charge while standing still), Cancel
Start Button: Status screen, Save (from item menu)
Select Button: Show item menu

Hints:

Game Pause
- To pause the game press B on the second controller.

Crystal Mines is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Color Dreams in 1989. Like all Color Dreams games, Crystal Mines was not officially licensed by Nintendo.

In Crystal Mines the player controls a robot via remote control to conduct a mining operation on a newly discovered planet in the year 2265. The robot can use energy balls to dig through dirt and rock as well as defeat enemies. On each level, the player is required to collect a certain number of crystals while avoiding falling rocks and enemies. Once the required amount of crystals have been collected an exit appears somewhere in the level that takes you to the next level.

There are 100 levels. The last 50 levels are similar to the first 50, but are rearranged to be more difficult. Other changes in the last 50 levels can include harder enemies, shorter time limits, more difficult puzzles, fewer bombs, require more crystals to complete, a different location for the exit, and have a different starting place that may put you in immediate danger.

Crystal Mines was redesigned and released by Color Dreams's Wisdom Tree label as Exodus and Joshua. Its engine was also used for the games Spiritual Warfare and Bible Buffet.

Easter Eggs:

When the screen that shows the player and level appears, press A and B to select a level.

    <desc>You are probably aware that there are a great many hacks of "The Legend of Zelda". So why bother creating yet another? Well, I beleive that even at this hack's early stages of development, it surpasses many others in terms of graphical enhancement. The graphical additions are borrowed largely from "Link's Awakening", but in some cases, are improvised following the tradition of modern (post 1990) Nintendo graphic art. A slight amount of text has been varied, and there have been no dungeon or overworld changes to date, although once I have completed updating the graphics, you can expect to see a separate version containing the "third" and "fourth" quests, possibly with a few added enemies and characters.

After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives

Zoggians Invade Asteroids

It figures. If anyone could've found the riches we'd stored on those remote asteroids, it'd be the Zoggians. They were three anonymous asteroids, in a storm of thousands of other asteroids. All of which looked almost identical.
That's why we thought they'd be a great hiding place - for rare minerals and precious gems. And they were.

Until the Zog pirates caught whiff of them.

Now, it's a universal disaster. They've attacked the asteroids, infiltrated our storage rooms, and confiscated jillions of astralbucks worth of commodities.Experience has taught us that conventional tactics don't work well against Zoggians. They're much too clever for that.

That's why we want to try out our newest advancement in armed spacefighter technology on them. The Cybernoid. This one's got everything. Standard laser blasters? Sure. But more. Much more. There are mega-ton blasting bombs, genocide missile exterminators, and off-the-wall bouncers for hair-raising action. Plus heat-sensitive seekers - to hone in on enemy ground installations. Not to mention the magnetic superconductor shield - for impact-proof protection. There's also a rear firing blaster - for double the defensive power.
Then there's our top-secret weapon - never before tried anywhere in the universe - CyberMace. You just have to see this one to believe it. And see it you will, because you're the one selected to fly Cybernoid's maiden mission. And you're the one who'll have to purge the asteroids of the Zoggian pirates. So go get 'em.

--From the NES Cybernoid instruction manual.

Gameplay:

Cybernoid is split into levels with each level consisting of several screen which are travelled via a flick-screen system of play rather than scrolling. The hazards in each screen can be different - some will have just enemy pirate ships, some homing missiles, some gun turrets, some indestructible enemies on fixed-paths that have to be traversed and some a mixture of these. The Cybernoid ship can collect power-ups for assistance (including a rear-gun and a giant spiked ball which flies around the ship) and also use a variety of built-in special weapons such as shields and homing missiles.

Shooting pirate ships often leaves power-ups or jewels which Cybernoid can then collect.

    <desc>Dai Senryaku is one of those strategic warfare games. It plays alot like Nectaris or Gameboy Wars for Gameboy, so if you played one of those, you know exactly what this one is like.

Anyway, the game is played in a semi-hex grid map, where you move various troops you place along the map, trying to take resources and destroy all of your enemy's units. Of course, placing units costs money, so you have to take over cities or whatnot (I guess they pay you a tribute or someting). If you like strategic warfare, this game is right up your alley!

Translation Description:

Well, a translation like this is hard to screw up, and Gideon Zhi does not disappoint. Good show, lad!

Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat is based on a three-player arcade game of the same title. It starred American IndyCar driver Danny Sullivan, and featured the tracks of the CART series of the early 1990s. Indy Heat was the third NES game to be released that featured an American indy car driver, the others were Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing and Michael Andretti's World GP.

Gameplay:

Indy Heat featured four-player capability, and was similar in gameplay to Super Off Road. Players earned money based on their race finishing positions, which was spent on improving their car. The race season culminated with the Tradewest Speed Bowl, which loosely resembled the Indianapolis 500.

Darkman, the cult movie hero, comes from the big screen to your NES in this game from Ocean. If you're not familiar with the movie, Ocean has provided some on-screen background, retelling the tragic story of Darkman and his quest for vengeance on those who have tried to destroy the bandage-ridden hero.

The object of the game is to help Darkman get revenge on his enemies and find his captive girlfriend. Darkman can be played by one or two players (alternating turns), and can be continued up to three times on any level. After the third continue you will have to begin Darkman's quest anew. The game consists of five main action stages with challenge stages between each.

As Darkman, you must first go through a deserted warehouse loaded with villains trying to stop you from getting to their leader, Durant. In the warehouse you must pummel criminals, use moving platforms, and climb walls (all very much like the Sunsoft cart Batman) to get out of this hellacious stage . A word of advice - the first stage is among the most difficult to finish, so stick with it, the game gets easier as you progress.

You continue your quest through Central Park, a Funhouse, Chinatown and across a partially constructed building. Each of these action sequences have their own unique pitfalls. The real fun, however, is in the challenge stages that lie in-between levels. The photo stage requires you to take pictures of your target in order to "make the perfect mask". The helicopter stage has you hanging from a rope-ladder and traveling at high speeds while avoiding trucks, birds and bombs. There are others as well, but I won't spoil the surprise.

Darkman is an average cartridge. There is nothing to make it any different than all of the other action cartridges on the market (with the exception of the photo stage - a very cool concept). The game is really a poor-man's version of Batman by Sunsoft. The graphics aren't as good and the controls are somewhat lacking. Still, it's a good game to play if you're a fan of the movie. One thing that will frustrate most gamers is the difficulty of level 1. This may be the most frustrating level 1 in videogame history. After this, the rest of the game is a cakewalk. Average graphics, average sound, and average gameplay makes Darkman for the NES just average at best.

A MESSAGE FROM S.H.U.S.H.!

"Ah, good to see you again Darkwing. I'm afraid that S.H.U.S.H. is once again in need of your unique talents. A mysterious crime wave has swept across our fair city. We believe that these crimes are the work of that notorious criminal organization F.O.W.L.!

"The Liquidator, Quackerjack, Wolfduck and other F.O.W.L. agents have been looting various parts of the city. These robberies may be part of a larger plan by F.O.W.L. to seize control of St. Canard. Do whatever you think is necessary to retrieve the loot and bring these fiends to justice. The fate of the city is in your hands. Good Luck, Darkwing."

--From the NES Darkwing Duck instruction manual.

Overview:

F.O.W.L (The Fiendish Organization for World Larceny) have organized the deadliest evil doers to help them in their evil scheme. S.H.U.S.H. (the secret crime-fighting organization that's so secret, nobody even knows what the letters stand for) calls in their best agent. It's up to DarkWing Duck to stop them with his Gas Gun!

Not exactly a spin-off, but Darkwing Duck does take place in the same world as Duck Tales and features cross-over characters like Launchpad McQuack and GizmoDuck.

Directions:

It's like Megaman, but with a Duck! It's pretty simple run and gun action, however Darkwing's gas gun has three other functions that you need power-ups for.

Lightning: Shoots two diagonal bolts
Heavy: Tosses a cloud of gas that shoots off left and right once it hits the ground.
Arrow: Shoots an arrow that can stick to walls and be used to stand/hang from.

Also, Darkwing can hang from almost anything, Ledges, Hooks, Street Lamps and more!

If enemies are shooting at you, you can block by pushing up! 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Activate Secondary Gas Gun function

Hints:

High Scores
- You can increase your score by collecting as much loot as possible. Since there's no time limit, you can run back and forth killing the same enemy multiple times, and keep collecting the loot he drops.

You're Dash Galaxy, fearless Space Explorer. You've just landed a thousand light years from home on an alien planet filled with strange creatures, deadly force fields and dangerous pitfalls.

Your Mission: to make your way through the incredible maze of rocket rooms and elevator shafts and return safely to your ship. Using your amazing athletic ability, you must enter all the rooms on each level and successfully collect everything in each room. You've only got a limited supply of oxygen, so you've got to get all the objects and make a mad dash for the door before you run out of air!

Watch out for those slime-sucking aliens. They'll take your breath away. It's time to show those freaks what an earthling can do! Are you ready for the challenge? They don't call you Dash for nothing - you can jump and run better than anyone in the Universe.

--From the NES Dash Galaxy instruction manual.

Overview:

Explore through a labyrinth of rooms and elevator shafts, collecting bombs and other useful items while avoiding force fields and pit falls. Run, jump, climb, and dodge your way up through the levels to reach your space ship and return home. And hurry up, because your oxygen is running out!

Graphically, Dash Galaxy isn't much to look at, and the music and sound effects are approximately abysmal. But it's still pretty neat all things considered, if you like running around trying to figure out how to grab everything without falling off the world or asphyxiating first.

Directions:

From the Dash Galaxy NES Instruction Manual:

You begin in the elevator shaft of each floor. You must enter rooms by passing through doorways. Sometimes the doors are blocked by force fields or large blocks. Once in the room, you have to turn off all switches inside before the door will open again to let you out. You must successfully go in and out of every room on one floor before you move up to the next floor. In the rooms, you can move up and down by using ladders or jumping on the trampolines.

That pretty much covers it, as far as what to do. One thing to remember is that your oxygen is your life. If you touch an alien it takes some away, as long as you are in contact. So if you run through them really quick, you lose less life, but if you just stand there one alien can kill you just by sitting on you. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
A Button + Direction: Push Blocks
B Button: Place Bombs
Start Button: Start, Pause

Hints:

Skip Levels

Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film.

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.

Trivia:

The string "Copyright(C) 1989 Knowledge Dynamics Corp." appears in the program executable, but it's unknown what role this company played in the creation of this game.

This is an old, old story from the stone and copper ages when there lived men and devils.

As the coming-of-age ceremony approached, Prince Myer grew nervous, for the day would be a memorable time in which he would succeed to the throne of the kingdom of Willner. In his worrying about the kingdom of the future, he took himself over by the lake near the castle to think. Suddenly, reflecting on the moonlight, a shadow arose from the lake. As the prince stared at it, it gradually changed into a man.

"Prince Myer! Light of virtue!" the man's voice rose out. "It is time for you to light up the darkness. Rubas, the horrid devil of darkness, is plotting to extend his power over your kingdom. He is viciously scheming to build a castle on the northern mountain, to ring magic bells, to lure monsters out at your defenses, and to invade the kingdom in a single stroke.

"If you wish to be forever at peace in the kingdom of Willner you must journey to the northern mountain and burn down the seven bell towers in the Devil's castle with the sacred flame. Prince Myer! Only you can accomplish this feat. Go to the mountain! Burn down the seven towers! Defend the kingdom against the devil!"

With that, the shadow grew mistier, lost its shape, and finally disappeared, leaving the beautiful lake as though untouched.

"Could it be an oracle?" Prince Myer murmured. He fell into deep thought for a moment, but immediately regained his senses. He had remembered the legend of Khan.

The legend said that at the time of the god's image appears from the lake, a great power will be given to a young man to defeat the devil of darkness and restore the kingdom. Hurrying back to the castle, the prince told the king of the strange event.

The king, believing in the truth of the matter, excitedly ordered Prince Myer to destroy Rubas and all his dark ways.

--From the NES Deadly Towers instruction manual.

Overview:

Deadly Towers is one of the oldest games on the NES list. Most of us remember seeing the cover, thinking this was the coolest looking game ever! Boy, what a let down. OK, where to start? Deadly Towers had the worst graphics Broderbund Software could afford and it does not get any better. The sound in this game, and I mean sound because you could not call it music, was a three second clip of a yeti giving birth, played over and over. Gameplay was quite horrific: your controls as they were called consisted of being able to walk off cliffs, die horribly at the hands of an enemy, or take your own life for having bought the game. The final deadly blow to Deadly Towers was the lack of story line. Something about some Seven bells, towers, or something like that.

I remember my brother and I sitting in front of the TV and, him playing Deadly Towers thinking that the story would finally all make sense. Sorry Folks, it never did. Deadly Towers is the only game I know of that the only reason for playing it is to say that you have or to attempt to kill yourself from lack of stimuli. So with that I wish you good luck.

Directions:

Conquer the towers (7 in all) with your magical flying sword so that you can burn down (using holy flame) the bell hidden in them. Kill enemies, collect money, buy better items, and proceed through the towers. Watch out for traps though! You can fall off of some ledges!

Controls:

A Button: Attack
B Button: Press twice in inventory to throw away item
Start Button: None
Select Button: Inventory

Death Race was a controversial arcade game, released by Exidy in 1976. While not the first violent video game to appear, it was the first video game to inspire a great deal of protest and controversy in the United States.

Overview:

In the game, designed by Howell Ivy and inspired by the 1975 cult film Death Race 2000 by Paul Bartel (starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone, and produced by Roger Corman), one or two players control an on-screen car (two cars if two players played) with a steering wheel and an acceleration pedal. The object was to run down "gremlins" who were fleeing the vehicle. As the player hit them, they would scream or squeal and be replaced on-screen by tombstones. This increased the challenge of the game as the screen cluttered up and the player had to avoid the tombstones.

The player was rated based on the number of points scored:

13 points: skeleton chaser 
410 points: bone cracker 
1120 points: gremlin hunter 
21 points or over: expert driver 

The object to the game was thus similar to the 1997 computer game Carmageddon.

The graphics were blocky, black and white, and primitive, but the "gremlins" looked more like stick men and the game's working title had been Pedestrian, so its implication was clear. In spite of Exidy president Pete Kaufman's denial that the intent of the game was to promote violence, Death Race touched off a media onslaught of controversy. The National Safety Council called it sick and morbid. The CBS news program 60 Minutes did a show on the psychological impact of video games. It was also covered on NBC's Weekend news show, in the National Enquirer and Midnight magazine.

The controversy increased the game's sales, causing another product run, but the game inspired so many protestsincluding the first-ever organized protests over a video game, led by Ronnie Lammthat in the end only about 500 units were made. There were even stories about the stand-up consoles being dragged into parking lots and burned by protesters.

The controversy is also credited with fueling the fledgling arcade industry as a whole. The market had shown signs of stagnation, but in the end 53 new titles from 15 different companies appeared on the market in 1976. There had been 57 titles released in the prior two years combined.

Legacy:

In 1990, an enhanced version of Death Race appeared for the Nintendo Entertainment System, by American Game Cartridges, Inc., a short-lived maker of budget titles. Gameplay was changed somewhat for the NES, moving play into a more visually appealing city and replacing the gravestone obstacles with a shooting helicopter.

The original arcade game itself technically cannot be emulated by a modern arcade emulator such as MAME, as it utilized TTL rather than a microprocessor and ROM. It reused much of the same hardware as Exidy's 1975 game Destruction Derby.

Because of its limited production run and the number of units that were destroyed, Death Race is very rare today. Collectors will sometimes pay $2,000 for a working unit in good condition.

A sequel entitled Death Race 98 was released, although it was in fact the same game with a new title. In 1978, Exidy released a follow up titled Super Death Chase (the name changed slightly in an effort to escape some controversy). In the sequel, the onscreen targets were already dead.

    <desc>This here is a first-person RPG. Most first-person RPGs suck, at least to me (I always die really easily and get lost frequently), but Deep Dungeon 4 isn't so bad. Sure, I get lost all the time, but after I remember to equip my weapons, I actually have a pretty good time with it. It's not TONS of fun, but it's head and shoulders above stuff like Might and Magic 1. Yuk.

Translation Description:

The script formatting here is pretty bad, and really noticeable in a lot of places, due to a lack of space in the ROM to put line breaks and such. In addition, the game's pointers are screwed up, making the game practically unplayable because the dialogue (including quest descriptions and other important things) makes no sense and doesn't match up with the Japanese script. kueller promised a 1.1 patch to fix all these problems, but this will most likely never ever happen. As it stands now, at some point in the game the graphics will glitch up so badly that you cannot progress any longer.

A little warning: applying this patch changed my rom's mapper to 193 (due to the patch being made with one of those stupid Ni0330 ROMS), which causes it to not work in anything but Nesticle, and even then some graphics are messed up. Be sure and use NES.COM or another NES ROM utility to fix the mapper (to Mapper 1), and the ROM should work after that.

Alternately, you can apply Spinner 8's addendum patch. This fixes the mapper issue, though not the other issues.

Star date 7211, the distant planet, Ligaras, is being attacked by alien marauders. The residents of Ligaras are being abducted and turned into mutants. You as the top gun of the Defender team, must save these people. The aliens are mean and vicious. You must fight with Landers, Mutants, Yllabian Space Guppys, and more. There is a special gate in each screen which you can warp into the other side of the planet. You meet more enemies there to fight. You are the only one who can save the planet, battle with aliens at the speed exceeding the speed of light, in dark unknown space.

--From the NES Defender 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

Defender is one of the biggest classics of all time. You get to defend the whole planet from the attack of aliens. Who could ask for more? This port onto the Nintendo was great. The graphics and controls were upgraded, but not too much so it still had that old arcade feel. I liked how you could actually see the alien craft picking up the innocent bystanders and carrying them off. You could still shoot the craft, but be careful not to hit the person being abducted. Play Defender and relive the past in style!

Directions:

Save the people of your planet from being abducted by Aliens! Kill the Aliens!

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: Bomb
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Smart Bombs
- Be sure to save your smart bombs for when you really need them. The bombs you start with are all you will get.

ENGLAND 1149 A.D.

Ripe with civil war, the once peaceful English countryside is tormented by trampling armies and thundering hooves, and its grassy knolls are stained red by fallen knights and serfs. The game's map screen displays the whole bloody territory and defines the boundaries of feudal lands. It also shows where castles and garrisons are located, and who lays claim to each territory (blue shields represent Saxon turf, orange flags represent Norman holdings. Your homeland is represented by a bold knight on a trusty white steed). In the upper-left corner of the map screen, you'll see a table. From there you will select your plan of action: Tournament, Conquest, Go Raiding, Buy Army, Read Map, Pass.

WHEN HISTORY AND FANTASY WERE ONE

It's a time of legends. A time for heroes. A time of bitter strife, when great men rise above their peers to perform great deeds. Your liege the king is dead, the throne vacant. Britain enters a season of destruction, a bitter winter that can end only when the last brave Saxon Knight lies dead or the Norman castles lie in heaps of rubble, emptied of their foul oppressors who have enslaved your people. It's a time when foreign invaders shall learn the truths administered by the shining blades of Saxon swords. It's a time when heroes are made and damsels saved.

Defenders of Dynatron City centers on a team of superheroes who protect a futuristic metropolis from Dr. Mayhem and his robotic henchmen. The Defenders are:

Jet Headstrong, who can fire his head like a rocket 

Miss Megawatt, who can shoot electric bolts 

Buzzsaw Girl, who has a buzzsaw blade instead of legs 

Toolbox, a robot with a smashing hammer head 

Monkey Kid, a blue monkey armed with exploding bananas 

Radium Dog, who can fly and has jaws strong enough to pick up cars with his mouth 

The game was adapted into an animated special by DiC Entertainment and was released on VHS.

Marvel Comics released six issues of a comic book adaptation, written by Steve Purcell.

Critical Response:

The game won praise in its preproduction by many video game magazines for the creation of an original superhero team. However, when the game was released it was widely panned by video game critics for, among other things, having a notoriously poor hit detection that required extremely precise aim for attacks to hit enemies.

You emerge from a groggy stupor and find your right palm covered with dried blood. Hmmm... no wounds... must be someone else's blood. The pain in your left forearm grabs your attention and you notice a tiny puncture. Is this from some type of injection? Your heart skips a beat as you realize that you can't remember who you are!

--From the NES Deja Vu instruction manual.

Overview:

Deja Vu plays almost just like Shadowgate. It was made by the same people and even used the same engine. Deja Vu is set in a more modern time though. It was pretty cool for a point and click game. It was pretty hard though. They made it where you could do things that would make it virtually impossible to beat the game, which means you had to start all over. Deja Vu is pretty fun, but be careful, or you'll have to start over.

Directions:

Solve the mystery of who you are and why you can't remember.

Welcome to an epic saga of Good versus Evil, where a Dark Fiend rules an ancient world with cruel, terrifying magic. The land cries for a champion to end the eternal tyranny. From a small farming village in the High Hills comes a noble fighter called Victar. He carries the battered and rusted hilt of an old sword. The fables tell of how this sword once defeated the Dark Fiend. Victar must find the missing blades and overcome the Fiend's demon horde.

This game is okay. Nothing special, but nothing terrible. The graphics are second-rate, nothing truly eye catching. The sounds and music were fine. The tunes in the levels have some good beats. The gameplay has not much to say about it. When you jump, dare I say, you go a little too high, and it's hard to control. However, using the weapons is not too tough. Give this one a try, and see if it's in your own tastes.

Directions:

You go through three worlds of enemies and challenge. Each world has two levels, each having a boss to defeat at the end to advance.

Mystic Gates may hold special items that could aid you on your quest. You will need a key to open it, though. 

Controls:

A Button: Use sword, activate selected weapon when in Sub Screen
B Button: Throw dart
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Uses selected magic
Up Button + Jump: Enter Mystic Gates if you have a key
Down Button: Crouch

Hints:

    <desc>Tokyuu Shirei Solbrain was released in United States as Shatterhand. Why bother retranslating? Easy. Nintendo butchered it, as they are so adept at doing. First of all, the hero is transformed from a fellow in a bionic suit to a street-punk type in a leather jacket ... Seriously NOA, what the hell? Then instead of picking up power (I assume that's what 'P' stands for), you're picking up gold coins ... which eludes me given the game's cyberpunk setting. And instead of a flying robotic drone, you're given a dismembered robot. Oh yeah, and the intro... in the Japanese version, there's a few lines of text explaining why you have a robotic drone thing. Of course, it isn't entirely necessary to know where the robotic drone comes from, but it adds a bit of flavorsomething usually lacking in a NOA translation. Oh yeah, and the NOA version doesn't keep track of high scores.

Gideon Zhi would also like to point out that Level C was re-writtten as a Submarine instead of a Carnival, and that the bosses of level B and C were switched around in the NOA version. God only knows why. Maybe they hate clowns and felt it necessary to axe the carnival? Maybe they're just anal? Who knows? Not I. I didn't even catch this diffrence the first time I wrote this review. But then again my recollection of the NOA version was based off of memory...

Now, on to the game. Minus the differences listed, there are no other differences between the games, the gameplay is exactly the same. It's a "run, jump and punch" game, kinda of remniscient of Batman by Sunsoft. You collect these little alpha, beta and gamma blocksand when you get three, the little robotic drone thing appears. But the type of attack it uses depends on what combination of letters you picked up. It's pretty straightforward for an action patformer. But it can get tough. I was never able to finish the game when I owned the cartand you know what? I still can't. But anyway, check it out, you'll like it!

Translation Description:

Everything's been translated. Version 1.01 fixes the title screen, so all is happy.

The original Japanese game was a simulation of the North African battles of World War II. Nintendo of America made Kemco neutralize the graphics (enemy units were originally represented by swastikas).

Destination Earthstar is a futuristic, first person, space shooter game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The view of the game is from the cockpit of a spacecraft. The goal of the game is to explore a grid which is displayed on screen in search of opponents to destroy and to land on planets some of which refuel the energy and refill ammo to your arsenal of weapons which consist of your photon laser which is your primary weapon and your secondary weapon torpedoes. After you have destroyed every enemy that is on the grid indicated by a number.

The number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid you will finally be able to to go to the planet labeled "B" on the grid. these planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill your vehicles energy or ammo but they are an enemy base that proceeds with you entering a 8 bit cutscene of your space craft entering the base's gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami's Gradius or R-Type where you can fire projectiles from the front or back of your ship.

    <desc>Wow. This is probably one of the better (if not best) Nes RPGs out there. It's the continuation of the ancient Chinese legend called the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which is a long and powerful epic that tells the story of The Three Kingdoms War, a drawn-out and bloody civil war that took place in China 2,000 or so years ago. It involves a gigantic cast of characters, an innovative battle system that plays like a hybrid of a strategy game and a traditional RPG. Graphically, I don't think I've been exposed to an Nes RPG as graphically stunning as this one. Decent graphics in an Nes RPG are rare at best, and this game pulls it off. Especially the little cinema cut-scenes - magnifique!

Translation Description:

Parallel to the setting and background of the actual game, this translation was a long time in the making. It was first started in early 1997 under the direction of Cataclysm X ([cx]), but due to the complexity of the ROM, it had shifted hands many, many times until it finally ended up with Destiny Translations. However, it is mainly Wildbill's labor of love, he's been there practically since the start of the project, with a rabid determination that is practically unparallelled in the translation community. He has taken the excellent translations by Faraday, Robin, Musashi, and Varkon - and turned them into a beautiful, mature, well-written script. I have never been exposed to a script so clearly-written - professionally done, or otherwise. ASM and creative use of substring compression by Jair and Taskforce have also helped to integrate the script seemlessly into the game. Kiddies, if you like RPGs, and you don't try this game out, you're on crack ^_^.

You are about to embark on a long and perilous journey. Your forces are waiting for your orders. The future of a nation is riding on your shoulders...
Dare to command!

--From the NES Destiny of an Emperor instruction manual.

Description:

Destiny of an Emperor utilises a number of features which made it unique amongst other traditional RPGs of the time. The player's party consists of up to seven members, five of which can actively participate in combat at any single time, one who serves as a replacement for characters killed in combat, and one to serve as both a reinforcement member and party tactician. The tactician provides magic-like effects, which all members involved in combat are able to use. Additionally, the player can capture or recruit around 120 available characters into his/her party over the course of gameplay.

The branching storyline allows the player the option of choosing alternate paths, which generally do not affect the plot in any significant manner. Although the branching paths quickly rejoin at a certain point in gameplay, it presented a unique experience unavailable in similar titles (Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior) of the time.

Destiny of an Emperor is based on Hiroshi Motomiya's manga, Tenchi o Kurau, which follows the story of popular Chinese historical figure Liu Bei and his sworn brothers, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu. This story is loosely based upon the events of Luo Guanzhong's dramatic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, itself based on historical events and battles which occurred during the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China.

Although the game loosely follows the events portrayed in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in many cases, the outcome is altered in Liu Bei's favour against the various other warlords of the period. Most of the deviations occur later in the game, particularly involving the invasions of the other ruling powers, the Kingdom of Sun Wu and the Kingdom of Cao Wei.

The sequel to this title, Destiny of an Emperor II, was released in Japanese text only. However, there is an English language ROM patch which translates the Japanese text into English text for those using the patch.

    <desc>You may have heard of Go Nagai if you're into giant robots. He created Mazinger Z. Here's Devilman, another creation by Go Nagai. Devilman isn't a giant robot, rather a giant? demon. But he's a good demon, more or less- he fights other demons for the good of mankind!

Well, in this NES game, you get to play as Devilman! Actually, you start off playing as his alterego, Akira Fudo. As Akira you really can't kill anything (in the streets, you pretty much face of against blue gangsters). You first have to find a certain person, who then tells you what you must do to become Devilman. After that, the game gets slightly more interesting. Now, you can kill the demons that are running rampant across the streets, although that won't do you much good if you don't go around collecting information. After some talking, you can end up playing as Miki, Akira's girlfriend. And that's pretty much up to where I got.

The game seems to be more of a detective game in the sense that to get anywhere, you really do need to talk to people and give them the right answer (sometimes, the right answer is kinda? weird- like having to answer that, no, you did not watch TV yet). From where I played, it seems the game is more focused on information collecting rather than fighting enemies. In the streets there's only one type of enemy. That may change in the later levels, though.

Fighting itself is kind of awkward. Not too awkward if you're Devilman, but if you're someone like Akira or Miki, enemies pretty much just fall back and run right back at you. You pretty much have no way of getting anywhere unless you jump over them (although I did fight one mini-boss as Miki and beat him up).

You might need to savestate if you want to get to the ending, unless you like noting down passwords. Also, if you die, the game will let you continue from there automatically (you have select continue first, though).

The game seems pretty fun. Snark's translation is kind of pre-90's in a way. Think something along the lines of the old Final Fantasy minus any apostrophes. Still, the game itself is pretty enjoyable.

To end this, it might be useful to know some controls:

 - A - Jump
 - B - Punch (or in Miki's case, slap)
 - Start - Pause. Here, you can select talk if someone's in the same room you're at, or you can view the password
 - Select - Once you've transformed into Devilman once, you can transform back and fro at will by selecting either up (Devilman) or down (Akira) in this menu. Later on, after you're done with Miki, you seem to need to punch demons out as Akira to build more anger so Devilman can fly to the next area.

Usually, characters will be terrified of Devilman and would much rather talk to Akira. Still, it's fun to see their wailing screams as Devilman tries to talk to them.

Translation Description:

Go Nagai's Devilman comes to life in this graphic and text action-adventure game for the Famicom/NES. High atop the Himalayas, ancient devils are stirring beneath the ice after ten thousand years of imprisonment. Archdemon Xenon, their four-faced master unleashes them upon the Earth much to the chagrin of humanity. You are Akira Fudo who combines with a powerful ancient demon named Amon to become Devilman! Six levels of fire, ice, water,secret demon research labs, Tokyo ruins, and much more to explore as Devilman, Akira, his friends, or girlfriend Miki! Four exciting alternate endings! Check the read-me file for the walkthrough and level passwords!

Devil World is a scrolling maze game, strikingly similar to the classic Pac-Man, only with an undeniable religious bent. Collect dots in an automatically-scrolling maze directed by the devil himself, use crosses to power up and destroy his minions, and be careful not to get crushed by the walls. After collecting all the dots, you must collect bibles to seal up the source of the enemies and make the devil temporarily retreat. After this, there is a timed bonus stage where the player can control the scrolling, then the next round starts the cycle over from the beginning.

    <desc>This is a pretty interesting game. You can use it to pretty much create your own scrolling shooter game. It's pretty simple: you go in and create a title screen, soome enemy and player sprites using a fairly simple editor, then design your map and place the enemies. It was probably one of the first "Make your own ... "-type-game. You should also note that it comes with a pre-made game, however it is insanely difficult!

Translation Description:

This patch translates all of the menus, and well .. everything. Pick it up and try it out!

    <desc>
Ace detective Dick Tracy pored over the crime files and mug shots that littered the desk in his dimly lit office down at police headquarters. 'This crime wave has to be the work of Big Boy Caprice,' he thought to himself. 'I can smell his greasy handiwork behind each of these cases. But I need to get some hard evidence on him. If only I can nab some of his hoods-Itchy, Flattop, and the rest. I'd rearrange their thinking and have them singing like that nightclub temptress, Breathless Mahoney. Then I could put Caprice behind bars for good.' Suddenly Tracy's two-way wrist radio seized the detective's attention. 'Calling Dick Tracy, Calling Dick Tracy.' He sprang to his feet and burst into the squad room shouting: 'O.K. boys, let's go! This could be our big break!'

--From the NES Dick Tracy instruction manual.

Directions:

The main objective in this game is to solve a series of cases dealing with crime (suspects are all associated with Big Boy, of course). This game can be quite difficult and complex, but it is a lot of fun once you get into it.

You must follow clues and the testimonies of those you interrogate, starting with the first clue that is given to you. The clues will lead to certain places and certain people within the city. As you continue to gather clues and interrogate suspects, you will eventually gain enough evidence to solve the case and make an arrest. As the game goes on, the cases take a bit more brain power to work through and the buildings are a lot harder to get through alive.

At the very beginning of the first case, start by looking at your notepad. It will give you your first clue which will say, "Fake $20 bill used near Steve the Tramp's flophouse." It is best at this point to go find out where Steve the Tramp is and interrogate him. You can get the location of suspects by looking at the mugshots, which is 5th and B for Steve the Tramp. After you know where you want to go, pick "hit the street" and go find it. The areas are fairly organized so it shouldn't be too hard to find, but be extremely careful avoiding guns on the way. Your life is very limited in this game. Steve will give additional information that will either lead to other clues or people in other places. Just keep following the clues until you have solved the case.

Whenever you enter a building to find a suspect or a clue, you will have to get through a whole building of people trying to beat you up or trying to kill you. So fight back by punching them. You can also use your gun on men that are shooting at you, but do not shoot men that are unarmed or you will lose life. If you get to a clue it will be really obvious because it will have a big arrow that says "clue". Suspects that you need to interrogate will be a different color than the usual guys, and they won't be attacking you like everyone else in the building.

If after exiting a building you come to a situation where a car suddenly pulls away quickly (your car siren will be on if this happens), then follow the car and keep shooting at it until you get it to stop. Then interrogate whoever it was. They will give you additional information you will need to solve the case. You can usually expect one of these car chases to happen if you get a really vague clue that doesn't really lead you to what you should do next.

Please be aware that you must have all the clues in order to arrest someone and finish a case, even if the clues you do have make it seem perfectly obvious who is guilty.

It can be extremely difficult to make it through a case alive, so be very cautious on the streets and in buildings. And whenever you see a heart looking thing, go get it because they refill your life and are extremely helpful (there is one in the warehouse where Steve the Tramp is). 

Controls:

A Button: On the Streets = Brake / In a Building:= Jump
B Button: On the Streets = Shoot gun / In a Building = Punch, use gun, or use item.
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: On the Streets = Get out of Car / In a Building = Select between using fist, gun, or item.

Hints:

Instruction Booklet Suggestions
- Here is some suggestions from the original instruction booklet:

Follow the clues
- Each clue tells you which location or criminal to seek out next. You may need to examine the Mug Shot book at a police station to link a clue to a particular criminal.

Conserve your Shots
- Tracy runs out of bullets, he must get another clip at any police station. His energy can also be restored by up to one badge when he returns to a station.

Remove Snipers
- When Tracy is out of his car, he can use it as a shield to protect him from sniper fire. If he kills a sniper, the sniper will not appear again until the next case."

John McClane decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a number of other hostages. The terrorist leader, Hans Gruber, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. McClane decides to fight the terrorists on his own, ascending the building as he does so.

Gameplay:

There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists, and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor.

At the start of the game, the player character can only use his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as firearms, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane get shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is lost through fighting against terrorists' shot bullets, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The game ends when all life is lost.

The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans, and any of the 40 terrorists left alive.

One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits.

The game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left, and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the sent helicopter by Hans.

Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Ready for tunnels of underground fun? Our hero, Digger T. Rock, is mining for a legendary lost city - and he needs you to dig in and help out! Burrow through mysterious caverns, each one a "mine-boggling" maze of unknown dangers.

Battle fierce foes like dinosaurs, ghouls and cranky cavemen with clubs. Collect rocks, dynamite, ladders and jewels, and use them wisely. Dig deep to uncover secrets, like how to open cavern doors - and how to reach them before they slam shut! Dare to dig down to the deepest, most dangerous cavern... and discover what lies beyond!

Gameplay:

You control the title character, who is searching for treasure hidden in various caverns. Digger has multiple tools which are found and can be used to explore and uncover new areas. A timer in the game represents his oxygen level before dying, but the timer can be reset by riding a pillar to another section of the cave.[1] Monsters such as moles and mosquitoes seek to kill the protagonist. The game is notable for the animation of the character's death, which shows a presumably time-lapse view of his body decaying with only his helmet remaining. It is noted among the most difficult games on the NES.

    <name>Dirty Harry</name>

    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Dirty Harry: The War Against Drugs is a 1990 video game based on Dirty Harry film franchise starring Clint Eastwood. The game is a side-scroller, and does not follow any particular storyline, except of course the eponymous War Against Drugs. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan here is a smallish blue-suited character who wields a .44 magnum, the "most powerful handgun in the world." Features found in traditional side-scrolling (power-ups and weapons) are included in a way that incorporates elements of Dirty Harry into the game. Digitized speech is present to deliver Harry's two most famous lines; a feature pre-dating Duke Nukem 3D's many digitized phrases by only six years.

Game Review:

"But wait," I hear you say, "if you beat it, even with a cheating device, then it can't be impossible!" Picky picky picky. To you I present another lame license, Dirty Harry, with another Mindscape-only record - the first game that's impossible even with a built-in invincibility code.

The game itself has your white-guy sprite battling it out against lots of little punky-hair sprites in the maze-like streets, and occasionally enter buildings and save little tied-up-lady sprites from really huge flickering guy sprites. The main good thing Mindscape could find to say about this game in their CES advertising was "Digitized sound. Actually hear Dirty Harry talk!" which, at 1990, was not going to floor your mom anymore.

Like Operation Wolf, this is a game of attrition. Punks are constantly punching you, shooting you, hurling dynamite at you, and calling you dirty names, and you have to duck into buildings to try and find life refillers. However, enter CLYDE as your password and you take no damage from enemies. So, no problem, right? Let's kill all the drug scum and restore peace to this sunny city!

Well, not quite. Harry Callahan's bane in life becomes not energy, but crowbars. Crowbars? You need to find crowbars to open locked doors, which lead to where the tied-up ladies are. Some locked doors, though, are decoys and go to plain white rooms. And, like all video-game items, crowbars break (or something) after one use so you need multiples. And, crowbars are only found in crates that give only a limited supply. So, unless you are absolutely perfect in your guessing which doors are correct to open, you will run out of crowbars. Then Dirty Harry is doomed to walk the streets forever because he can't open any doors, and you reset. Sorry.

Oh, I suppose someone could actually try mapping the whole city (the city is Escheresque; exiting right does not necessarily mean entering left) and spending endless nights trying every door and playing the game over and over again, but this, like most Mindscape games, seem like they were made with only five colors, has music that will make you yearn for the symphonic suites of BMX Airmaster, and have very little play value to boot. In other words, you first.

    <desc>A twisted, and very well done spoof of Castlevania 2. Basically, you play as a fellow named BBQ as he battles his whacko father. Almost every single sprite in the game appears to be changed, as well as all the text. In addition, many of the enemy and character sprites appear to be ripped from other games. Including such notables as Mario, the Contra guy, and Macho Man Randy Savage! Other oddities including day and nightime being reversed, and many of the undead from Castlevania 2 reappearing as townsfolk! This hack simply must be played!

Dizzy Prince of the Yolkfolk is an adventure video game published in December 1991 by Codemasters for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, DOS, NES and Amiga. It was the sixth game in the Dizzy adventure series. Initially it was only released as part of the Dizzy's Excellent Adventures compilation.

The creators of the series, the Oliver Twins outsourced the video game company Big Red Software to design and develop this game.

This was probably the smallest Dizzy adventure game in terms of the number of rooms, but this meant that it was maybe the game with most critical acclaim. Magazine Amstrad Action was noted in its dislike of walking from one area of the map to another to complete problems which it said was tedious. The smaller map helped to counteract this. Reputed to have been commissioned, designed, developed and completed in less than a month.

The game in November 1992 was enhanced and re-released with the illfated Aladdin Deck Enhancer under the title, Dizzy The Adventurer. The title was then released in 1993 as part of the The Excellent Dizzy Collection.

A couple is getting married at a wedding chapel, but the wedding is ruined when a bat comes over and turns the groom into a frog. The two dwarfs from Don Doko Don are called in, and are told that they must find a potion that will turn the groom back to his human self.

To do this, you must go through five lands infested by wildlife. Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons.

You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key. At the end of each land, you encounter a boss that requires quite a number of hits to kill before you can proceed to the next land.

In this game, you play a bearded dwarf whose girlfriend has been kidnapped and taken away to the dragon's castle, and in order to rescue her, you must defeat enemies with your mallet. Once you do, you can pick them up and throw them at other enemies, and collect the fruit that they leave behind. When you have defeated all enemies, you proceed onwards to the next round. If you take too long to complete a level, a winged devil will appear who will try to kill you while flying around the screen

Occasionally, power-ups will appear in the middle of the level, and these power-ups will increase your power, award you with different weapons, kill enemies, or freeze time. The more power you have, the more walls that you can through enemies through. At maximum power, you are able to throw enemies through all walls. If you happen to carry the blue hammer, you are able to throw it through walls, too.

There are five areas that consist of ten levels each. At the end of each area, you have to defeat a boss in order to proceed further.

Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.

Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is the third of the "Donkey Kong" arcade game series, changing the format to more of an action-shooter than a platform game.

As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned under Donkey Kong, who has taken over a multi-level greenhouse. Stanley's goal is to remove Donkey Kong from the greenhouse, but the big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight.

Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are close to him to send down a swarm of angry Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees toward Stanley. These insects, as well as caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are intent on destroying the flowers below Stanley. Donkey Kong will also send down projectiles himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks. Stanley must jump between the levels and use his bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey Kong into the next area of the greenhouse.

Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can of super bugspray will become available, allowing a larger shooting radius, and is able to send Donkey Kong up the vines faster.

Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong will end up with a beehive on his head, and the levels start all over again.

Hints:

Insecticide Canisters
- Always be sure to pick these up when they fall, you will beat the level a lot faster with a better weapon.

Donkey Kong is an arcade game developed by Nintendo, released in 1981. It is an early example of the platform genre, as the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging obstacles. The storyline is thin but well-developed for its time. In it, Jumpman (now known as Mario) must rescue a damsel in distress, Lady (now known as Pauline), from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular characters.

The game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cut scenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.

Despite initial misgivings on the part of Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong was a success in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A court suit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's win in the courtroom helped position the company to dominate the video game market in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Story and Characters:

The eponymous Donkey Kong is the game's de facto villain. He is the pet of a carpenter named Jumpman (a name chosen for its similarity to "Walkman" and "Pac-Man"; the character was later renamed Mario, and made a plumber, not a carpenter). The carpenter mistreats the ape, so Donkey Kong escapes and kidnaps Jumpman's girlfriend, originally known as the Lady, but later named Pauline. The player must take the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl. This was the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that would provide the template for countless video games to come.

At game's end, Jumpman and the Lady are reunited.The game uses graphics and animation as vehicles of characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Jumpman's demise. The Lady is instantly recognized as female from her pink dress and long hair, and "HELP!" appears frequently beside her. Jumpman, depicted in red overalls and cap, is an everyman character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations forced his design: Drawing a mouth was too difficult, so the character got a mustache; the programmers could not animate hair, so he got a cap; and to make his arm movements visible, he needed colored overalls.

Donkey Kong is the first example of a complete narrative told in video game form, and it employs cut scenes to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to the top of a construction site. He sets the Lady down and stamps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cut scene begins. A heart appears between Jumpman and the Lady, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Jumpman reaches the end of the final stage. He and the Lady are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The game then starts over at a higher level of difficulty.

Gameplay:

Donkey Kong arcade cabinetDonkey Kong is an early example of the platform genre (it is sometimes said to be the first platform game, although it was preceded by Space Panic and Apple Panic). Competitive video gamers and referees stress the game's high level of difficulty compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience and the ability to accurately time Jumpman's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving the Lady, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The player receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points. The highest recorded score was set by Billy Mitchell on June 26, 2007; he achieved 1,050,200 points. He has been challenged many times by Steve Wiebe, who is holding the 2nd best record with 1,049,100 points, this score having been set on March 23, 2007.

The game is divided into four different one-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final screen occurs at 100 m. Later ports of the game omit or change the sequence of the screens; the original arcade version includes:

Legacy:

Donkey Kong spawned the sequels Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong 3, as well as the spin-off Mario Bros.. A sequel to the original arcade game on the Game Boy, named Donkey Kong, pairs Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Junior. It starts with the same damsel-in-distress premise and four basic locations as the arcade game then progresses to 97 additional puzzle-based levels. Nintendo revived the Donkey Kong license in the 1990s for a series of platform games and spin-offs developed by Rare, beginning with Donkey Kong Country in 1994. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (2005) is the latest in this series. In 2004, Nintendo released Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a sequel to the Game Boy title. In it, Mario must chase Donkey Kong to get back the stolen Mini-Mario toys. In the follow-up Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Donkey Kong once again falls in love with Pauline and kidnaps her, and Mario uses the Mini-Mario toys to help him rescue her. In 2004, Nintendo released the first of the Donkey Konga games, a series that involves a rhythm-based bongo controller. In 2007, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast was released for the Wii. Super Smash Bros. Brawl features music from the game arranged by Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka and a stage called "75m," an almost exact replica of its Donkey Kong namesake. While the stage contains her items, Pauline is missing from her perch at the top of the stage.

Its success entrenched the game in American popular culture. In 1982, Buckner and Garcia and R. Cade and the Video Victims both recorded songs based on the game. Artists like DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince and Trace Adkins referenced the game in songs, as did episodes of The Simpsons, Futurama and Fairly Odd Parents. Even today, sound effects from the Atari 2600 version often serve as generic video game sounds in films and television shows. The Killer List of Videogames ranks Donkey Kong the third most popular arcade game of all time and places it at #25 on the "Top 100 Videogames" list. in February 2006, Nintendo Power rated it the 148th best game made on a Nintendo System. Today, Donkey Kong is the fifth most popular arcade game among collectors. The 2007 motion picture documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters explores the world of competitive classic arcade gaming and tells the story of Steve Wiebe's quest to beat Billy Mitchell's world high score in Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong Jr. Math is a Nintendo edutainment video game where the player must solve math problems in order to win. It was released in 1983 for the Famicom and then outside Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System two years later. In Japan it was released nearly one month after its first counterpart Popeye no Eigo Asobi which involved Popeye and English spelling.

Donkey Kong Jr. Math Lesson, a combination of Donkey Kong, Jr. Math and Donkey Kong Jr., was also released for the NES. The bundle allowed for two-player gameplay in Donkey Kong Jr.

Donkey Kong, Jr. Math is one of the available NES games in the Nintendo GameCube version of Animal Crossing. It has been released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America.

Gameplay:

The game features one player and two player modes. In the one player mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points.

In the two player mode, each player applies a math operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to the number they have to make it another number, trying to eventually reach a mutual goal number. However, signs and numbers are on the same field for each player, and they must race to reach the final number. The identity of player 2 is unknown.

When it comes to the preservation of console games of the 1990s, the development work that came out of Korea tends to get overlooked by many historians and archivists. And it's not hard to see why: these games were usually only sold in Korea and, even then, in what seem to be pretty small quantities. Glancing through the many, many games on Sam Derboo's A History of Korean Gaming (by far the definitive English-language resource on the subject) will reveal a surprising amount that are not generally accessible to people.

Which is why we were thrilled to be recently given the opportunity to help archive one of the few remaining "lost" Korean console games: Dooly Bravo Land.

Dooly the Little Dinosaur is a popular cartoon star in Korea. This particular game, released by Daou Infosys in 1992, was the character's only outing on Nintendo's 8-bit system. It was also the final game in Daou's Dooly trilogy. The other two titles were released on the MSX and the Sega Master System.

This was an exciting score for us, because in many ways, it closes the books on digitizing some of this rare history: it was the only missing Daou-developed game, the only missing Dooly console game, and most likely, the only missing Korean-developed, original game developed for the NES during the system's lifetime (other unpreserved software is either posthumous or utilitarian, i.e. educational software or digital karaoke).

This cartridge was kindly loaned to us by a Korean collector going by Taksangs. Thanks to Sam Derboo for arranging the loan, and to Kevin Horton for help with the digitization process.

Our Dooly Bravo Land archive, which includes the game binary, cartridge scans, and a lossless video recording (via emulation), is available on The Internet Archive.

    <desc>Doraemon is some kind of anime series in Japan. I don't know for sure since I've never seen/heard of it. And I really don't care either. Here is one of many games based on Doraemon. Fortunately, you don't need to have heard of it to play this. At least, I don't think. At first glance, this is just your typical boring Famicom RPG. And for the most part... well, it is. But there's a lot of stuff in it that's really neat and makes it pretty fun to play. Some parts just are so unbelievably badass that they can not be described in a review such as this. I don't know whether to recommend it or not, since the cool parts are pretty scarce, but anyway just give it a try. Or not. I think you should though.

Translation Description:

If any of you have ever played one of WakdHacks's (pre-LordTech) incomplete patches, you probably won't be expecting a whole lot. Amazingly enough, the complete release is almost error-free, grammar wise. This is a splendid translation, and I really must commend everyone involved, especially poor magimoogle.

The level intros are translated too, but may be buggy, like when you see the screen with all the items. Actually, all that's left is the title screen, but who cares about the title screen.

Use this patch on the mapper 15 hacked rom, otherwise it won't work. Well it'll work, but it'll look bad. Bah!

    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
This is a gameshow that used to air on the television station Nickelodeon a while ago that was hosted by Mark Summers. This game is filled with a lot of messy, sloppy challenges as well as pop-trivia. Out score your opponents and you will get to race against the clock in the obstacle course, full of difficult and messy challenges, to win yourself a lot of great prizes!

Directions:

The game starts with an opening challenge to determine who gets control. In this challenge push left on the control pad to start the speed/angle cursor, right on the control pad to pick where to stop on speed meter, and the B button to stop on the angle meter.

Your guy will then huck a banana, hit a golf ball, or do whatever depending on what your speed and angle was. Complete the challenge before your opponent to win $10 and gain control.

The team in control then gets a trivia question asked to them by Mark. They can either answer the question for $10 or dare the other team to answer it. If they answer right another question is asked for $10. But if they decide to dare, the point value for the question then gets doubled to $20. The team that gets dared can then answer or double dare. If they double dare the question goes back to the original controlling team for $40. The controlling team from this point has the option of either answering the question for $40 or taking a physical challenge. If you take a physical challenge you must accomplish a certain task in a limited amount of time. Before a physical challenge there will be a screen that describes what you must do. (Please note that a computer opponent always guess after being double dared rather than taking a physical challenge.)

If there a dare or double dare involved, and a team gets the question wrong or does not complete the physical challenge, the points are awarded to the other team who also gains control. If a first question is answered wrong, then no money is awarded but the other team still gets control. In the second round all values are doubled (i.e. they go up to $20, $40, and $80). Whoever has the most money wins and goes on to the obstacle course.

In the obstacle course, press left and right on the control pad alternatively as fast as you can to run or climb up things. When you are near the flag, use the control pad to line yourself up to grab it then press the B button to jump. From there continue alternating between left and right until you need to jump for whatever reason. Complete all eight obstacles in 60 seconds to win the grand prize.

Controls:

A Button: Select answer/action (in challenges)
B Button: Same thing as A Button
Start Button: Start Game
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Strategy on Dares
- Sometimes you may want to take a chance and dare even if you know the right answer because if the question comes back to you on a double dare, you will get four times the money for answering it.

- On the other hand sometimes you may just want to guess instead of daring, especially if the other team steals from you a lot when you dare. In this case the other team will not get any money if you guess wrong, but they will still get control.

    <desc>This is a hack of Double Dragon for the NES. What I have been trying to do was make the NES version a bit more authentic to the Arcade original. I changed a few graphics that I felt didn't really fit in or changed them to look like something from the original. I also changed palletes to look like the original. Probably the biggest pallette change you will notice is the Final level. It is white by default, but the arcade was goldish. So I changed the whole level to be that pallette.

    <desc>This was an attempt at making the game more "challenging" in an adequate way although the enemies' health was (for the most part) increased, the player is given extra continues, more health, &amp; the ability to keep weapons after an enemy dies. The biggest drawback is the sprite change when a different enemy appears on screen when the previous enemy's weapon is still on-screen.

The mistakes in text have been corrected as well as other numerous changes which have escaped me now.

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in their quest. Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack. The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.

The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

Based on the arcade game, Double Dribble is a basketball action game for one or two players. You can select different time limits for games, select teams, and begin playing!

Gameplay is entirely action, so no time needs to be spent customizing the teams or with statistics. You control each player on the team one at a time (the player with or about to receive the ball will be human controlled, with the computer taking over the other players temporarily.) Some versions feature a small amount of digitized sound effects, and close ups of slam dunks.

B Button: Shoot(Offense), Switch Player(Defense)

Hints:

Fly Boy
- If you shoot while you're running down court, you'll defy gravity and soar like an eagle close to 30 feet! God, I loved game physics back in the day.

    <desc>Technos? Hell yeah, people. Yet another in the huuuuuuuuge series of Technos Nekketsu games, this one involves you racing against three other people. There's weapons strewn all about the course, so fair play is definitely not encouraged here. I think there's some other events, but damned if I know what they are. And how come I'm always slower than the other guys? Am I unable to dash here or what?

Translated Description:

You officially know as much about this patch as I do. Jiji's website is (apparently) long gone, so there's no info on this patch. Hell it might even have a readme somewhere, I just kinda found this patch at RPGd, even though they say that Ballz translated it. At least, the intro setup stuff is done, so you can get through a race without encountering the accursed gibberish.

    <desc>This game was released here as Dragon Power, and a whole hell of a lot of stuff was changed. Like, instead of running around beating up stuff as Goku, you run around beating up stuff as this weird little monkey thing. And of course, a weird little monkey thing is MUCH more acceptable for American audiences. Anyway yeah, that's pretty much the game. You run around beating up stuff. As Goku. And there's lots of cutscenes interspersed throughout the game which gives it an illusion of plot. Despite it being Dragon Ball, it's a pretty fun little game, if you like those sort of odd Famicom games.

Translation Description

Just a warning, TransBRC's translation isn't great, and even borders on Suck. But it's still a helluva better game than Dragon Power.

    <desc>The first in the painful series of Dragon Ball Z RPGs. I dunno, people seem to like them, and it seems to follow the DBZ storyline faithfully, but, like many anime games, it doesn't really dwell on who the hell anyone is. If you're anything like me, you'll be thinking "who the hell is this Kami guy, and where did he come from?" constantly. But I'm sure if you love DBZ like most people seem to like DBZ, then you obviously won't have a problem with this.

I've said elsewhere that DBZ RPGs like this one are incredibly random and bad and not fun and the stupid cards are just stupid. But since I was forced to play this game for more than five minutes, I checked up on some places so I could figure out what the hell those cards were all about (the RPGClassics shrine was amazingly helpful in this regard). And then I set to work playing. And you know what?

This game isn't that bad.

The number at the top-left indicates the card's Attack power. On the map screen it's also how many spaces you can move (no more, no less). The symbol in the middle usually doesn't mean much, but if it matches the character who's using it, their attack is stronger. If it's one of those funky X-looking symbols, they can use a special attack. And the symbol in the lower-right is the card's Defense rating (in RedComet's translation it's a Roman numeral). Battles are essentially random, but if you have another character adjacent to yours, both will participate in the battle. Which is good, because you'll get your ass kicked at first if Goku and Piccolo don't stick together. Seriously, I thought these guys were supposed to be badasses. And one little Kankousen and Goku's dead. Pfff.

Translation Description:

New things in version 1.00/1.01: Rewritten scripts (hella better read); Huffman compression (didn't have to shave even one letter off the scripts after the rewriting/editing was finished!); The text windows now hold twice the amount of text as before; The two previously "unfixable" bugs are fixed; And a kick-ass title screen made specifically for this patch (thanks Elf).

    <desc>This game is... er, well. You play as the great mighty hero, Carl, who thankfully doesn't go around with a hairy gut poking out from underneath a wifebeater. You go from dungeon to dungeon (which have to be entered with the SELECT button, for some screwy reason), killing monsters with your limited supply of bouncy arrows and wandering from room to room. When you haven't visited a room, you won't be able to see it, cuz it'll be dark and stuff, but when you enter the room, it'll become light! Wowie! That way you can tell where you've been and where you haven't!

The problem is that there's no real map feature, and since all the rooms look the same it's very, very easy to get lost, especially when all the rooms have been lit and you're just looking for the door that goes with that key you got from killing the brontosaurus, or when you're looking for the room with the big nasty dragon in it so it can kill you all over again. And then, once you beat the big nasty dragon, you get a NEW map with a whole slew of NEW dungeons to go through! Yay Carl! It's no wonder there haven't really been any more of these games since 1989.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated  in other words, the title screen and the credits that may or may not be used. Woo!

"Dragon Buster" is a conversion of Namco's arcade game from 1984. The game is composed of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. Your goal in every level is to reach the final stage where you face the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, you move through the platform-like stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since you can't heal your character between the stages.

The game features a fairly strait forward story having to do with an evil sorcerer named Zabbaong who has unleashed a hoard of enemies on the land of Baljing. The Dragon Spirit has summoned a powerfull warrior named Dragon warrior to defeat Zabbaong and his evil monsters.

Gameplay:

You control a warrior as you play through six different stages like a snow area, machine area and a waterfall area. During the game you fight dragons, robots, centipedes and many other monsters. There is a boss to beat at the end of each stage with the final boss being a giant evil sorcerer. You have two main attacks in human form, a sword that you can swing and a blue ball that you can shoot at enemies. When you gain extra power, you can turn into a dragon and shoot 3 shots at once. The game has a fairly average difficulty level when compared to other Nintendo games

Graphics and Sound:

The game had decent graphics for it's time but not amazing graphics. There were a few explosions and attacks that looked and sounded good. Each stage has a different soundtrack that fits the setting of the stage. The Stage designs are unique with little to no obstacles or platforms at all. There are also some stage effects in the background like running water or flashing lightning.

This incredible story starts from a place deep inside the mountains, several thousand miles away from the city. Goku and Nora are on a mission to find seven crystal balls. Their trip is filled with adventure, action and thrills. They go through a desert, into caves, and battle monsters. But with the seven crystal balls in their possession, one wish they want will be granted to them by the Dragon Emperor. We wish them good luck!

--From the NES Dragon Power instruction manual.

Overview:

DRAGON BALL! Yes, this is a Dragon Ball game that was cleaned up for the western market. This game has you as Goku playing through the first part of the Dragon Ball story.

    <desc>Translation Description:

Dragon Scroll is an action-RPG much in the vein of the original Zelda. Three thieves have stolen the eight Magic Books sealing the evil in the world. You, the Gold Dragon must assume the form of the hero Feram and get those books back. Much like Zelda, finding out what you're supposed to do is probably the hardest part.

This patch should be complete, down to an Easter egg I just found out about from a Japanese video. I did have to fix up some of Konami's bugs in the text window drawing routines. I partially added SRAM support to help out with the translation, but if you'd like to use it, see the readme.

Based on the 1983 Cinematronics coin-op. This was the first blockbuster of the genre, though it wasn't the first game in the genre (that distinction is given to Sega's coin-op Astron Belt). Dragon's Lair is strictly a game of memorization, as there is a very linear sequence of events required to guide Dirk the Daring through the castle. The highlight is the animation, courtesy of Don Bluth, John Pomeroy, and Gary Goldman. Not like the 1983 Cinematronics arcade machine. You play as dirk in a platform adventure game.

    <desc>After a year and half, Dragon Slayer Jr. - Romancia is done!

DvD Translations' translation of Romancia features a variable-width font, a fully translated, edited, and polished script, a translated title screen, cleaned up/restored the graphics on the title screen, and extensive beta testing to weed out bugs.

It also features enhancements to game play to make the game more playable/enjoyable including: bug fixes to the original code, script embellishment for better hints, (optional) restoration of a previously unattainable item, and (optional) removal of the main situation that required you to have to restart the game.

Although greatly improved from when it was first beta tested, figuring out what to do in the game is still the most difficult part, and none of us can kill the final boss without extensive use of save-states.

If you are ready for a challenge, try it out!

I just heard of Dragon Spirit when I came across it in the "need to review" list. So, I loaded it and played it for a while. If I didn't have to do a review on it, I'd still be playing it. It was a very fun game. This game was unique in a couple of ways. First off, it was basically a shooter and it had a good storyline (go figure). Second, it had a "skill test" level.

The story goes like this: There was a legendary hero who could transform into a dragon. He defeated the ultimate evil a generation ago. His son, Lace, finds out that he inherited this power when his twin sister is kidnapped. It turns out that the evil being that was defeated by Lace's father wasn't the true enemy after all, and that true evil has risen from the darkness, hoping to make the world its slave. Your job is to stop this, of course.

Directions:

Fly, shoot, and dodge your way to saving your world from ultimate evil!

The first level is the aforementioned "skill test." If you beat the first level and boss, you will play as the blue dragon. If you die on the first level, you will play as the gold dragon. The blue dragon is harder to play with. On the other hand, when you play as the gold dragon you will not get to play through the entirety of the game.

I really liked the power ups in this game. They reminded me of Life Force, or Gradius. You can get rapid fire, multiple heads, and little baby dragons that will shoot with you, to name a few. These power-ups really intensify the gameplay and keep you going. All in all I think it was a great game. If you like overhead view shooters, you should really give this game a try! 

Controls:

A Button: Shoot(Air)
B Button: Shoot(Ground)
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: None

Hints:

Twenty Dragons
- Start the game and defeat the first boss. Then die intentionally and when you start the game again, hold down A and B when you press start.

    <desc>This patch has three noticeable effects:

It changes all the spell names, where applicable, to match the translations used in Square Enix's most recent Dragon Quest series translations (Dragon Quest VIII and Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen for DS).

It changes the class names to reverse Nintendo of America's censoring of some of the NES version's religious references, to those used in the English version of the Game Boy Color remake.

Where appropriate, it changes the 2-letter class abbreviations that are displayed on in-battle status screens to match the changed class names.

Dragon Warrior III is set many years before the original Dragon Warrior in a world separate from the first two games. A wicked fiend, Baramos, threatens to destroy the world. vThe Hero, son or daughter (the player can choose to be either male or female; the only gameplay effects of gender on a character is that a few items, like the feathered cap, can only be used by female characters and some dialogue changes with the gender) of the legendary and recently deceased Ortega, recruits up to three travelling companions and sets out to defeat Baramos, only to find later that Baramos is merely a disciple of Zoma, the fiend who rules the Dark World below. 

The Hero then travels to the Dark World, which is known as Alefgard in the previous installments of the series, and restores light. For his/her bravery, the Hero receives the title of Erdrick (or in later versions, Loto).

The Hero travels from his/her home country of Aliahan to explore the world and acquire two of the three keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which he/she then trades for a sailing ship at Portoga. With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia (in later versions, Lamia). Ramia takes the Hero and his party to Baramos's castle. After a ferocious battle, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma attacks and opens the pit to the Dark World.

In the Dark World, the Hero acquires most of the artifacts that need to be collected in the original Dragon Warrior, including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge, which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation.

Controls:

A Button: Open Command Window. Enter your selection in Command Window and other screens.

Hints:

Unlimited money
- Leave the castle and travel to the "Adventurer's Hall of Registration". Create a list of soldiers, then go downstairs to the "Eatery". Enlist three of the soldiers, sell their equipment, then remove them from your party to collect 400 gold. Repeat this procedure to gain unlimited funds.

Dragon Warrior II is set one hundred years after Dragon Warrior. A century of peace is suddenly ended when minions of the evil wizard Hargon attack Moonbrooke Castle. One lone guard, a wounded survivor of the battle, makes his way towards the kingdom of Midenhall. There with his dying breath he informs the king of their dire circumstances. The king then commands his son, the prince of Midenhall and a descendant of Erdrick (known as Loto in the Japanese versions and later re-localizations), to defeat Hargon.

The prince begins his quest alone, but is later joined by two cousins: the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the prince of Cannock, who leaves on a similar journey about the same time as the prince of Midenhall, the two must rescue the princess of Moonbrooke, who was in Moonbrooke Castle when it was attacked. It is up to the prince of Midenhall to find them, join forces, and together defeat Hargon.

    <desc>Dragon Warrior 1 is a great NES game, but the graphics aren't very good. That's normal, since the original Japanese game was released in 1986 in the early day of the NES. On the other site, Dragon Warrior 4, released a few years later, was very nice-looking. As such, I decided to replace the graphics of DW1 by those of DW4.

I did a lot of graphics changes. I also hacked the palette for the overworld map and inside Tantagel castle. As you can see in the screenshots below, the overworld is pretty much complete, besides a few color mistakes. I'll do my best to fix that. I began to work inside Tantagel castle, but the work there is quite early. I still need to change all the characters sprites and palettes.

In olden days of yore, the realm of Alefgard was cloaked in darkness. According to legend, a brave warrior, Edrick, brought light back to the land by defeating an evil being. He used the Ball of Light bequeathed to him by a friend to drive off the enemies of Alefgard. He then gave the Ball of Light to King Lorik, who unified Alefgard.

The land was at peace for many generations. In the time of King Lorik XVI, the Ball of Light were stolen from Tantegel Castle by the evil Dragonlord, and once again the Kingdom of Alefgard was plunged into darkness. Many travelers fell prey to the merciless fangs of monsters, and the beautiful land was transformed into poisonous swamps that hindered travelers. It was also rumored that several Towns and Villages were destroyed; wiped off the face of the land by Ghosts &amp; Dragons.

Many brave warriors tried to recover the Ball of Light, but none of them returned from Charlock, the Dragonlord's dark castle. The people longed for peace, but did not give up hope. The great Seer Mahetta predicted that "One day, a descendant of the valiant Edrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord."

Who is this brave soul? There is only one possible answer.
You. Your quest is to find and defeat the Dragonlord. The time has come. This is the start of your adventure. Welcome To The Realm Of "Dragon Warrior"

Chapter 1: The Royal Soldiers.
As Captain of the Royal Soldiers, Ragner risks his life daily in the service of the King of Burland. Recently, children from all over the land have been disappearing. Anxious to know what tragedy has struck the kingdom, the King sends forth Ragner. The mighty warrior knows no fear as he sets off.

Chapter 2: Princess Alena's Adventure.
The young Princess Alena possesses a strong and clever spirit. She wishes only to leave the sheltered castle of her father, the King of Santeem, so that she can taste the adventure of a free life. The King has refused to let her go, but his will cannot bind Alena. Dreaming of danger and excitement, she plans to escape.

Chapter 3: Taloon the Arms Merchant.
An ambitious man, whose greatest dream is to be independent, lives with his wife and child in the town of Lakanabe. Taloon works at the shop of a weapons merchant, and he has learned everything about the weapons trade. Unfortunately, Taloon does not have enough money to buy his own shop. So he sets off to find or earn a great fortune.

Chapter 4: The Sisters Of Monbaraba.
When Loro, the world renowned blacksmith, died of mysterious causes, he left behind two daughters. Nara has studied the magic of fortunetelling and acquired a great power. Mara began training as a dancer, in the ancient style, at a very young age. Her skill is unequaled. They are determined to find the cause of their father's tragic fate, no matter the peril.

Chapter 5: The Chosen Ones.
In Chapter 5, you, our Hero, arrive to lead the characters from earlier chapters. As a team of experienced and highly trained adventures, you will challenge the enemy. He is a fierce demon who has secretly tracked the characters through Chapters 1-4. Now he will make a dramatic appearance.

Dragon Warrior 4 was probably the best game of the series. It was longer than its predecessors, and the graphics were a little better, too. In Dragon Warrior 4 you get to play as several different characters and then get to play all of them at the end. I liked this method pretty well. You get to develop a relationship with each of the characters as you go along, and then get to team them up against your common enemy.

Think Ahead
- Remember that you will need to reuse the characters that you play in the first chapters of the game, so be sure to advance them as much as you can.

    <desc>I've made this hack to be able to select any item in the game. You do so by pressing and holding select before you select your inventory. By doing this, you will access an alternate inventory. Everytime you repeat the process you will access the next page. If you want to keep the current page, do the same, but press and hold start. To have the desired item in the real inventory, just select it with the A button. Then enter the inventory normally and you will have that item.

Remember to enter your inventory normally before you equip the items, or you will get dummy items on the equip menu. The same goes if you want to sell an item. Another point to note is that you must have at least one empty slot on your inventory before you select an item on the alternate inventory, or the game will freeze. You can also use any item on the alternate inventory, for example medical herbs or any other usable item.

I've also hacked the game so you have max stats for all your characters, included the extras, all the extras have the Metal Babble equip set, you can walk through most things inside dungeons and towns, and you have max and infinite gold and casino coins.

 - Thanks to: Ugetab: He made the walk through walls code.
 - gedowsky: He made some extras stats and equipment codes.
 - Paulygon: He made some extras stats and equipment codes, and the allways terrific blow code.

    <desc>A full scale hack of Final Fantasy, nothing remains but the core programming routines. It features all new graphics, music, levels, enemies, text, statistics and more. Think of it as a "Total Conversion" for the NES.

After numerous releases, the hack has come to a state I consider final: All known bugs have been fixed and the gameplay has been polished to the best of my abilities. SRAM files from any versions other than 1.30 or Final will *not* work properly with this release. Sorry, too much has changed.

    <desc>
It had been three months since Michael last heard from his brother. He grew impatient as he waited for his letter.

He waited for another month, but to no avail. With some concern Michael began to suspect that something had happened to him.

Michael's brother, Doctor Ginn Chaos, was a genius in physics specializing in warp zones. He knew that the experiment on warp zones could bring hazardous results, so he conducted research alone at his lab in a remote village.

He sent Michael a research report every month. According to the last report, Dr. Chaos had succeeded in creating warp zones. He seemed to have continued his research on the effects of such space on a living body.

Michael decided to go to his brother's lab. The lab stood in a quiet evening, but it didn't look like anything existed inside.

Gathering his courage, Michael stepped inside the house. In the silent hallway, he saw only rats and bats. On a desk near the doorway he found his brother's diary. On the last page he read:

"Month_____ Day_____

I made a great mistake. I overlooked the effect of warp zones on living organisms. It was too late when I realized this. The living things in the warp zone had grown so big that they began to take over my house. The warp zone can swallow you up at any time. Open one of the doors to the warp zone and you will be attacked by these monsters. I have been trying to invent machines to stop the monsters but I am not sure if I still have time. My brother Michael, if you happen to read this diary, you are the only one who can stop this situation."

Michael searched for the machines, but could not find them. The monsters coming out of the warp zones must have grabbed them away. He had to do something about this before someone fell victim to the monsters. With a knife in his hand, Michael kicked open the door....

--From the NES Dr. Chaos instruction manual.

Gameplay:

The player assumes the role of Michael Chaos, brother of mad physicist Dr. Ginn Chaos, who has been doing Warp Zone experiments in his mansion and gone missing. Armed with only a Knife in the beginning, as Michael moves through the house, he can pick up Handgun Bullets, Machine Gun Bullets, Grenades and life-replenishing Yellow Vitamins and Red Vitamins. There is a menu which has four options, open, get, go, and hit. There are 11 Warp Zones in all. At the end of each of the first 10 Warp Zones, Michael must fight a large monster that carries a piece of the Laser and guards a valuable piece of equipment, the latter consisting of the Ultra Space Sensor, four Life Bottles, the Air Helmet, the Jump Boots, two Blue Vitamins and the Shield Suit. Once Michael fully assembles the Laser, he'll be able to challenge the final boss, Canbarian.

Trivia:

For some reason, an ad for this game wasn't made until 1990, which created for those who hadn't heard of the game before then the illusion that it was released that year. The ad featured the tagline, "Do you dare open the doors to doom?", which, also for some reason, was featured in the ad twice, at the top of the page and within the box art.

    <desc>Awesome awesome game. Brilliant brilliant game. You thought Konami was weird when you saw Solid Snake skateboarding? This is weirder. It would be a typical old platformer, except for the fact that you're a penguin. And, your goal is to lose weight to get back in good with your chicky penguin. And all the bad guys? They throw FOOD at you! So you have to avoid the food cause that makes you get fat and die. Haha, it's cool even talking about it.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated! WOOOO! All the stuff that you'll actually SEE, anyway. Kitsune mentions that there's some untranslated text in the rom that refers to a level that was - I assume - cut from the game during development, so you never see it during the course of normal gameplay. So don't worry about it. Just play the thing and have fun.

Are you itching for something 'new' to play on your beloved NES? Then the Dreamworld Pogie Kickstarter might be the one for you. If you are British and of a certain age, you'll no doubt remember the Dizzy series of games by The Oliver Twins. While most of the Dizzy success story was on home computers, publisher Codemasters did bring Dizzy to the NES in the shape of The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy.

As prolific coders the Oliver twins did now and again experiment with new franchises and Dreamworld Pogie for the NES was one of them. Coded in 1993, this game was to be a colourful platformer where collecting stars was the name of the game, but it was never released and has remained locked away, until now.

The source for this game has recently been rediscovered by one of the Olivier twins and a Kickstarter with a modest goal of &#xA3;6000 was recently launched, which reached its funding goal within a matter of days.

The aim is to bring backers the game, faithfully boxed and packaged with a NES cartridge, poster and instruction booklet just like it would have been in the early '90s, had it been published.

    <name>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Dr. Jekyll is on his way to his wedding with the lovely Miss Millicent. As he walks to the church with his cane in hand, several townspeople, animals, and other obstacles accost him, causing him to become angry. If his anger reaches a certain level, he transforms into Mr. Hyde and is taken to a nightmarish world of monsters. As Mr. Hyde kills these monsters, his anger abates and eventually he transforms back into Dr. Jekyll.

There are two endings to the game. The normal ending occurs when Dr. Jekyll reaches the church at the end of the sixth level. Dr. Jekyll weds Miss Millicent and 'END' is displayed with the wedding march playing in the background. The alternative ending occurs when Mr. Hyde reaches the church. In this case, a boss named Letule appears. After defeating the boss, Mr. Hyde transforms back into Dr. Jekyll. A more detailed scene of the wedding is shown with Dr. Jekyll kissing Miss Millicent. The screen fades with 'END' displayed, and lightning strikes a few moments later. A silhouette of what appears to be Mr. Hyde with a cross behind him appears.

Gameplay:

The game features six levels, but the levels differ between the Japanese and North American versions. The Japanese version follows this order: City, Park, Alley, Town, Cemetery, Street. However, the North American version replaces a few levels and follows this order: Town, Cemetery, Town, Park, Cemetery, Street.

The player starts out controlling Dr. Jekyll on his way to the church, walking to the right. As he takes damage from the various enemies and obstacles, his Life Meter decreases and his Anger Meter increases. If his Life Meter is fully depleted, Dr. Jekyll dies and the game is over. If his Anger Meter completely fills, however, he transforms into Mr. Hyde. Day turns to night and monsters appear. At this point, the level is mirrored horizontally and Mr. Hyde walks from right to left with the screen autoscrolling. Mr. Hyde must kill as many monsters as he can as fast as he can in order to turn back into Dr. Jekyll.

If at any point Mr. Hyde reaches Dr. Jekyll's location, a bolt of lightning strikes him, killing him instantly. Therefore, the objective of the game is to advance as far as possible as Dr. Jekyll and to transform back as soon as possible as Mr. Hyde.

Reception:

The game was the first to be reviewed on the website Something Awful, gaining a score of -37.

Brett Alan Weiss of the Allgame declared that the "music and graphics are tolerable, but the controls are sluggish and the action is exceedingly dull, rendering Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde almost unplayable."

The game is often criticized for its artificial intelligence, the useless cane weapon (which does absolutely nothing to the townspeople), lack of levels and slow pace (Dr. Jekyll moves very slowly, and cannot run).

Hints:

A little help
- Try not to become Mr. Hyde. You'll go reverse in the level.

Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite.

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.

Duck Hunt is one of the first home games that you could play with a light gun. While the gameplay became repetitive after only a couple of times playing, it still made for a big hit. The graphics were nice, with bright colors and well drawn sprites. The sound effects were nice too, with the dog giving you a little chuckle if you ever miss the ducks. Many people have tried to shoot him for this, but it simply can't be done. Duck Hunt can be a lot of fun to play, so be sure to check it out.

Directions:

There are three games to choose from. In game A, you must shoot as many ducks as you can, with one duck appearing at a time. In game B it's the same, except the ducks come two at a time. Game C is clay pigeon shooting. Clay pigeons are launched two at a time, and you must shoot them before they hit the ground.

In each variation of the game, you will have stages that are built on ten targets, whether the targets are clay pigeons or ducks. After ten targets, the game will count up how many you hit. Each stage will require you to shoot a higher percentage of the ten to move on. What stage you get to doesn't matter so much, because this game is all about points. If you fail to make it to the next stage though, it's game over.

All three variations also give you three shots per screen, after that you will have to watch your targets either fly away, or hit the ground. 

Controls:

Shoot at screen: Start Game
Shoot Offscreen: Select game mode

Hints:

Control the Ducks
In game A, you can plug a controller into the other controller port, and a friend can use it to control which direction the duck flies.

    <desc>Jack the duck is no ordinary quacker. He is witty and rather clever, but this is not enough to get his precious egg to safety. He needs your help and ingenuity to get through the 20 mind-boggling mazes! Beware of the hidden dangers: the foxes, the traps. But most of all, let those sleeping bulldogs lie. Start your adventure in level 1 and challenge your way through to level 20, or if you are feeling vigorous, go straight into a higher level. But whatever you do, DON'T CRACK THE EGG!

Duck Tales for NES is a traditional platform game in which the player takes the role of greedy Scrooge McDuck in search of treasures around the globe. He counts on his three nephews and on other Duck Tales characters to help him in his quest through inospit places such as the Amazononic forest, the African Mines, the Himalayas, Transylvania (where he meets Dracula Duck) and even the Moon.

Each one of them reserves the old duck lots of adventure, different enemies and hidden rooms.

The game features a 2D side-scrolling platform gameplay very similar to Mega Man. Graphics are colorful and cartoonish, music remembers players of the TV series and controls are very simple.

Head out across the high seas as the legendary Pirate Island, a lush tropical island loaded with buried treasure and buried trouble. You'll explore secret catacombs of unrelenting mind-bending challenge. Discover wealth beyond your wildest dreams. But what is the value of all the riches in the world after you've been snuffed out by the twirling STAR-A-LIZER or the slobbering, bounding JAWS.

Trivia:

May be the only father/daughter design combo in classic gaming (Cam is Michael's daughter). Basically the same as Trolls on Treasure Island, with new levels and slightly changed graphics.

"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun The Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five."

Once upon a time there was a great warrior. This warrior, MAGI, owned the most extraordinary suit of armor and six of the most beautiful swords the world has even known.

The armor was impervious to all but the strongest magic. The swords were forged of ors that came from deep within the earth and five of them had been enchanted with the powers of the Elements. The last sword is a mystical blade, cast of a powerful, unknown metal. It is the greatest sword of all. It is TORES! For over 500 years, since the end of the Great War, the power of this great armor and those swords have kept peace throughout the land.

Darces the Dark, an evil Overlord, led the evil uprising that became the Great War. Magi defeated him and Darces was exiled to a land far away. But evil does not rest! Those forces have been marshalled over these long years by the dreaded Darces the Dark. Magi was fatally wounded in the battle. While the great warrior no longer lives, his swords and armor do.

It is your quest to find the five Elemental Swords of MAGI, secure TORES, defeat Darces and return peace to the land.

--From the NES Dungeon Magic: Sword of the Elements instruction manual.

Story:

500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior "Magi", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, "Tores", used an even more powerful metal.

Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and passed away.

Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land.

According to an old saying,

"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun 
The Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. 
The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; 
We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five." 

One of the interesting aspects of the game was a magic system where a caster could combine runes from various elements to form new magic spells.

Each element had three unique runes, which allowed for 125 different spells. Unfortunately, many of those "different spells" are actually just fireball spells or curative effects. This game had no "magic point" system, so some spells drained the player's hit points instead.

Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball (released in Japan as Softball Tengoku) is a one- or two-player NES game where players can pick and choose various fictional softball players and customize their own team to take to the championship. The player can even pick a letter out of the alphabet to customize his team name with.

In the original Japanese version, however, monsters like Draculas, mummies, ghosts and other fantasy creatures could be selected. Once that is done, the player then selects a field (with each one of them having its own special house rules).

Dynowars is a pretty weird game. The graphics weren't that good, but the gameplay was pretty original. You get to play as the guy some levels, while others you get to drive a huge dinosaur. The controls aren't very responsive and the story is kind of stupid. I would only play Dynowars if I was feeling nostalgic.

Directions:

There are two types of gameplay in a level: when you're a human, or when you're a cyborg dino! The human can jump and shoot his weapon, and the dino can kick, punch, and pick up other dinosaurs. There are seven planets in which you must first, use the Dynobot to get to the AIC by making through the level and beating the boss dynobot.

The boss dynobots are, a Huge Theropod, a Huge Pterodactyl, another Huge Theropod, another Huge Pterodactyl, yet another Huge Pterodactyl, a Sauropod, and another Sauropod. Then, you must control the man to infiltrate the AIC and shut down the Life Support Computer (LSC). Then you must escape and travel to the next planet.

You have two "health bars" in this game: Energy and Barrier. A capsule with E on it will replenish Energy, your primary hit points. A capsule with a B on it will give you Barrier, your secondary hit meter. During the dynobot part of each stage, you will be able to use your satellite defense system one time by pressing Select. It will destroy everything on the screen. You will not be able to use it against the boss dynobots.

There are several weapons to get in the game. The punch is the one you start with, and what you'll be reduced to if you die. The launch-fist will fire your fist at the enemy and you won't be able to fire again until it comes back. The fireball shoots straight forward and is pretty powerful. Bombs will be thrown in an arc at your enemies. Beam will shoot a laser at your enemies that will travel through them to damage the ones in back as well. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot weapon
Start Button: Confirm option, Pause/unpause
Select Button: Choose between Start and Pass Word

Hints:

Passwords
5431 = Level 2
9892 = Level 3
6315 = Level 4
7452 = Level 5
1697 = Level 6
6425 = Level 7

    <desc>For a lot of people, EarthBound Zero isn't very fun because of the excessive level-grinding necessary, particularly during the early parts of the game. To help alleviate this problem, we've made a very small IPS patch that doubles the experience and the money you receive from enemies. According to some, this actually makes the game a little too easy, but for the first-time player, it's probably pretty decent.

    <desc>In the early 1990s, a mysterious dark shadow covered a small country town in rural America. A young married couple vanished from their house without a trace. The man's name was George, the woman's name was Maria. Two years passed, and George suddenly returned. He never spoke to anyone about what he had experienced. Instead, he lead a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned.

Eighty years have passed since then. You play the role of a young boy who lives together in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters. One day, something strange happens: the house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and to learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge. The four heroes will explore the world and find out the connection between the strange events of today and the mystery of the past.

Closely related to the SNES game EarthBound, "Mother" is an unusual console-style RPG set in modern times. Combat system is similar to Dragon Warrior: you meet random enemies and bosses, and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Instead of magic, your characters can use special psychic powers called PSI.

    <desc>This is an old hack (circa 2001). It was meant to make all the game text more palatable, which it succeeds in. It was also meant to double the experience you get from enemies, but it turns out this feature doesn't work right. There are other little changes here and there as well. It's also a little buggy in places, so only try this hack if you're bored and have nothing better to do. I was planning to do more work on this hack, but it's pretty much a dead project at this point.

Translation Description

This is a nearly complete v0.9 release. Everything important (dialogue wise) is translated. There's a large sign that says ?????? "Defeat Lolo" that isn't done. The passwords are still in kana, and if that's changed, the two secret phrases need to be changed to read something in English.

    <desc>Egypt is an odd sort of puzzle game. You're this Indiana Jones-type lost in a tomb who gets swallowed up by a God entrapped in an orb (don't ask). Basically, this translates to you having to move the orb around on a grid, destroying various Egyptian idols. You accomplish this by moving the idols onto adjacent squares, which involves shifting entire rows and columns over at a time. It's sorta like a simplified Rubick's Cube with only one surface. It's pretty fun, though the game starts to entirely own you after the first dozen or so levels. Check it out.

Translation Description:

This is now fully translated. Yay!

As super-sleuth Agent 17, code name "Otto", you must come out from undercover to accept a top-secret mission. Your country's security is at stake.

You must sneak through a heavily guarded, top-security enemy defense building to steal secret government documents. Only well-planned strategies, bullet- dodging, quick-on-the-draw accuracy and black belt karate prowess will allow you to succeed!

If you fail, your government will deny any knowledge of your or of your assignment.

Good luck!

--From the NES Elevator Action instruction manual.

Overview:

You play as a spy by the name of Agent 17. You have to steal government documents from a heavily-guarded building. You have to get their fast, though! All of the guards are on the verge of finding you and taking you out once and for all!

Directions:

You must go between floors and enter the red doors to get the documents. Once you have found them all, you can get to your car at the bottom of the building. Kill the bad guys by shooting them, knocking overhead lamps on them, or kicking them!

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Fire gun
Start Button: Pause/Unpause, start game
Select Button: Choose between 1 or 2 Players

The entertaining Eliminator Boat Duel puts you in a series of one-on-one speedboat races against competitors with names like Seasick Sidney and Aquarius Rex. At the start and finish lines, you see the action from a side-view, and during the race the perspective switches between an overhead angle and a behind-the-boat perspective. Winnings are used to upgrade your boat with faster engines, more acceleration, better steering, etc. The visuals are surprisingly attractive, featuring colorful environments and detailed boats viewed from three perspectives.

You have a ship with virtually no equipment. Take her and trade among the different star systems. You can be safe and trade on razor-thin margins among the safe systems, or take some risks and trade with anarchic systems while watching out for pirates. You can save on fuel costs by buying a fuel scoop and fly near the sun, but again, watch out for pirates! Or be a pirate yourself and raid other ships... Don't get a bad rep as the police will come after you... Dock with space stations and do your trades (some may take contraband...) Upgrade your ship with your proceeds with better weapons, shields, and other equipment. With 8 different galaxies, each with HUNDREDS of planets, there are plenty of room for exploration! Can you make your reputation all the way up to "elite"?

    <desc>Translation Description:

Esper Dream 2 is a nifty action/rpg by Konami. The five rings of the Book Worlds have been stolen, and it's up to our ESP-endowed bookworm hero to find them and save the day! The game itself is fairly neat. You visit a number of different worlds, each symbolized by a bookcase, each very different from the last. A battle sequence is initiated when you come in contact with enemies, which are symbolized by little walking pawprints - you're then taken to a small arena where you have to destroy your enemies, Zelda-style. It's pretty fun!

There are no known issues with the patch, so enjoy!

Top Players' Tennis gives you total command of the ball. Hit a passing shot cross court or deown the line; play deep from the baseline; serve and volley; play a perfect drop shot; or take the game with an overhead smash. You set the speed of the serve and the spon on the ball, giving it a top spin, slice, drop shot or side spin just like the pros.

There. Now that I've banished the outsiders, the rest of you who've seen the movie (and loved it, no doubt) are all too familiar with just how great it is. In fact, the whole Evil Dead series is pretty nifty. I know what you're thinking: why didn't anyone think to license a Nintendo game for these movies? Well, rom hacker K. Voorhees is about to show you why not?

Race your way to stardom, or build your own track and challenge your friends to beat your best time! Excite Bike was my favorite game for a better part of my childhood. Excite Bike was also a very monumental game because it was the first game to feature battery backup. You could build your own tracks and save them, so when your friends came over on Saturday morning you could show them off. Excite Bike was all about gameplay. There was not a story to it at all. On the other hand, it didn't need one. I loved it anyway and didn't even notice the lack of storyline. Excite Bike is definitely a game worth checking out.

Directions:

The gameplay was where it was at. Popping wheelies, jumping super high, and using turbo, it was awesome. You must be careful when using turbo though, watch your temp. gauge. If you don't let off turbo before it gets full, you will overheat. I liked having the option to race the clock by myself, or with other riders. When racing other riders you had to bob and weave through them so as not to touch them. Then, I found out that if you touch their front wheel with your back wheel, they will fall down. At that point it became a knockdown contest. Who can knock down the most guys in one race? I was pretty good at it.

Controls:

A Button: Turbo Accelerate
B Button: Accelerate
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: N/A

Hints:

Rapid Remount
- When you fall off your excite bike, you can tap A or B real fast and you'll get back on your bike faster.

    <desc>The NintendoAge community has collected donations from its members to purchase and release yet another NES game from the vault of prototype/rarity hoarder Jason "DreamTR" Wilson, this time forking $500 for the prototype of Exerion II. Somehow, this group actually managed to find something more obscure than their previous acquisitions, Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch and U-Force Power Games.

If you've never heard of the first Exerion, it was originally an arcade shoot'em up developed by Jaleco (Bases Loaded), brought to the U.S. in 1984 courtesy of Taito. The game was ported to Famicom, Sega SG-1000, and MSX (also appearing on collections for PS1 and GBA before hitting Wii's Virtual Console in 2007), but none of those home console versions ever crossed the Pacific.

A sequel titled Exerion II: Zorni appeared on MSX in Japan, but an NES edition intended for a 1989 release never made it to stores. Up until this week, little was known about the NES version, save that Wilson had acquired a possessed a prototype for the game. Thanks to NintendoAge and the contributions of some 25 members, the prototype ROM for Exerion II is now available to download.

Those who've played the original Exerion and now the sequel say that the gameplay is identical in the follow-up, but with new graphics and audio, as well as a quad-shot gun.

This is a shoot-em-up game with parallax effects in the background. It does have a simulation of inertia in the control of the ship. There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast. Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon. With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply. A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.

    <desc>One of the best SMB hacks of all time

Extra Mario Bros. is not just a typical SMB hack. The gameplay has been altered significantly and is reminiscent of Metriod in many ways, including maze-like level design and even the graphic style. Some Metroid tiles are imported directly as well.

There are multiple new enemies and other modified gameplay elements which will impress even the most jaded SMB hack fan, but what really shows ATA's hacking skill is the final scene with Bowser (available for viewing on Youtube).

This is a must have hack for fans of both SMB and Metriod.

Difficulty: moderate to hard. Fun factor: high but can become tedious if you're expecting straightforward Mario action.

Description:

New maps, new graphics, new enemies, new powerups, new physics, new final boss. It's practically a new game.

Translation Description:

Seems pretty cool. He made little icons for the funky vertical menus down at the bottom of the screen! This patch should now be complete with the latest update.

Family Circuit is a racing game for Nintendo's Family Computer (known to some as the NES), hence the name. Unlike other Nintendo racing games at the time, it has many realistic traits, removing itself from the main crop of more arcade oriented titles. The car can be customized to your heart's content, with different tires, wings and suspension and detailed engine settings for both turbo and torque.

Four racing modes are available:

 - Free run: Run any way you want around the track, getting to know both the curves and straights as well as the settings of your car.
 - Sprint race: Race a season in four classes  novice, B class, A class and Super A  around well-known (Fuji, Suzuka) and less well-known tracks (Family Park, Namcot-ring), competing for the first place.
 - Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.
 - Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in any class around any track.

As you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it. Some of this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide. Racing straight through an opponent with both cars undamaged is perfectly possible.

Once upon a time, there were two families. They didn't really hate each other, but some man named Richard Dawson helped them sort out their differences in a battle of smarts.... thus the Family Feud is born!

When it comes to gameshows, two famous names come to mind. Merv Griffin and Mark Goodson (what irony that their initials match). Merv Griffin is famous for Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, meanwhile, Mark Goodson is famous for The Price is Right, Match Game, and Family Feud.

Directions:

The whole idea is to win the game and get past the 200 point mark. when you do that, you go to the bulls-eye round (if you lose the game, the opposite family doesn't play, either from tax problems or family problems) for a chance at a whackload of imaginary money, which you can brag about at school, at work, or wherever you feel like bragging about winning at a 90's Nintendo game.

Hints:

Toss-up Strategy
When the survey question comes up, it will tell you the top number of answers. You can easily win the toss-up. Once you do, guess the best possible answer (it's pretty simple) then if you get control of the board, look at it. If there are very few answers, take them (unless you don't know jack about the category); if there are a lot of answers, throw them over, unless you are sure that you know every answer on the board. To help you remember, recite this: If it's small, take it all. If it's big, throw it like a dirty wig.

Dizzy is this egg, you see, and the idea of the Dizzy series is that he gets in these silly situations (usually involving the kidnapping of his girlfriend) and he has to get out of them by solving puzzles and traversing the countryside while not getting hit by anything. EVERYTHING hurts Dizzy except, apparantly, falling hundreds of feet (he just lands on his butt and sees stars for a little bit in that case).

There are two versions of NES Dizzy. The first one was released in gold cartridge form in 1991, and the second one was released as an Aladdin cart in 1993. There are several differences between the two:

- Stars. The gold version has 100 stars; the Aladdin version has 250.
- Dizzy walks a lot faster in the Aladdin version, and the inventory system is a bit simplified - when you pick up an item, it goes as far to the right of your inventory window as possible.
- There are some small terrain changes, and some items are in different places.

Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.

More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).

In the space year 1422, the Fantasy Zone was cast in panic at the collapse of the interplanetary monetary system. The Space Guild brings to light the plans of the planet Memon, whose forces are stealing the other planets' currencies to fund a huge fortress in the Fantasy Zone. Opa-Opa is sent to stop the invading army and discover who is behind it. In the end, it turns out that the leader was none other than Opa-Opa's long lost father, a revelation that leaves Opa-Opa with mixed emotions.

Gameplay:
 
In the game, the player's ship is placed in a level with a number of bases to destroy. When all the bases are gone, the stage boss appears, who must be defeated in order to move on to the next level. There are eight stages, and in all of them, except the final one, the scroll is not fixed; the player can move either left or right and the scroll follows him, though the stage loops. The final level consists of fighting again all previous bosses in succession and then facing the final one.

Opa-Opa uses two different attacks: the standard weapon (initially bullets) and bombs; the normal shot is generally useful though weak, while bombs are powerful though they only drop downwards. He can also move down to land on the ground by sprouting feet and walking around until he flies again.

In the game, it is possible to upgrade Opa-Opa's weapons, bombs and flying engine which makes him faster, as well as get extra lives. In order to that, the player must first get money by defeating enemies, bases or bosses, and access a shop by touching a red ballon with the "Shop" word written on it. The screen later changes to a menu where the player, for a limited time, can select any item of choice. Each time a new item is bought, they become more expensive. When the player chooses to exit or the time runs up, another screen appears, in which he or she can select what upgrades Opa-Opa can use; only one engine, weapon and bomb can be equipped at a time.

Some of the new weapons have a time limit that starts as soon as the shop is left. Some of the bombs can be used at any moment, but they are limited. On the other hand, the engines are permanent, though some of these actually makes Opa-Opa hard to control, as he moves too fast. The powerups can also be re-assigned by reentering the shop or touch a balloon with the word "Select" written on it. If the player loses a life, all of the upgrades are lost.

Long ago, in a far away land just around the corner, raged a battle against a fierce Wizard.

The Wizard was cruel beyond imagination, and cast his bad magic upon the good people of the kingdom. Legions of soldiers were sent out to battle the Wizard, but the soldiers returned to the king defeated and disgraced.

Fortunately, sorcerers loyal to the good king devised a magical means to create a dragon. By having the dragon fight the Wizard, no more harm would come to the townspeople or the King's soldiers.

The sorcerers were victorius as the dragon's great power defeated the Wizard. The king ordered the sorcerers to entomb the Wizard inside of a special sword. The little kingdom was safe from the wizard, and the people were prosperous once again.

The good sorcerers told the king, "Should the Wizard ever escape from within this special sword, only a warrior from a faraway land will be able to defeat him!" The next day, the sorcerers had mysteriously disappeared.

The special sword was placed in the care of only the highest officials in the land, and was passed down along with the prophecy from one generation to the next. All the while, the Wizard, entombed within the special sword, thought to himself, "If I were so fortunate to escape this prison of mine, then the people of this little kingdom shall suffer the wrath of my revenge!"

Then, one day, not too long ago, in the kingdom of FARIA something terribly ominous was in the air...

--From the NES Faria instruction manual.

Overview:

A princess has been captured, and now you, the soldier, must save her! Along the way, you must also save the entire world! For the sake of the land of Faria, you must!

Directions:

This game plays much like Zelda 1 and 2! When you get out of a town, you get to move around until you hit a random encounter, in which you can fight the enemies and get what they drop! Now, you must defeat all enemies to leave. If you don't, you'll probably drop some cash! There are many different weapons, from swords to bows to magic!

Controls:

A Button: Use weapon
B Button: Manipulate special item, cancel command
Start Button: Bring up command pause menu
Select Button: Select special item in battle scene

Hints:

Powerup trick
When you're at the title screen, press the Start button and choose the ''New Game'' option and press Start again. On an empty file press A to be taken to the insert name screen. Type in your name as: GaoGao

The Elf town, Eolis, was once a town boasting peace and prosperity. Yet, now it is on the verge of destruction. Meteorites are raining down upon the World Tree and crazed monsters have taken the opportunity to run amuck. Wells are drying up and people are in the grips of fear.

To restore peace again, someone has to penetrate the giant World Tree and overthrow the Evil One that lives in the Evil Place. Now it is your mission to set out on a journey bearing the hopes of the people of Eolis.

--From the NES Faxanadu instruction manual.

Overview:

Faxanadu is a good example of an action/adventure game with RPG elements thrown in. The story is that you were away for some time and upon return you find your tree town to be overrun by dwarves. You belong to the race of elves. The dwarves attempt to rule your people by taking your water supply. The King wants you to save them. In return, he gives you fifteen hundred "golds" to start your journey. I'm usually not the one to complain, but maybe he could have spared a little more. Let's say that's all he had. Well, why didn't he at least order the townsfolk to hook you up with some weapons and armor? Instead, you have to pay just like anyone else, so be careful how you spend your money.

Faxanadu is pretty enjoyable game. The graphics were pretty good and the sounds weren't bad either. The only complaint I have is in the gameplay. It seems that they would have made it possible to kneel. As they didn't, you have to kill things below your knees with magic until you get a weapon with a downward strike. Aside from that, it was a good game. I recommend you give it a shot.

Directions:

Save your town from the water-stealing dwarves!

As you go on your journey it will be very important to talk to everyone and note what they say. You will gain experience and money as you kill bad guys. When you think you are near gaining a level, hit up a guru in one of the towns and he will level you up if need be. As you start to collect a lot of money, buy new and improved armor, shields, weapons, and items, they will help you on your way.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Menu

Hints:

Bonus gold
Speak to the King at the start of the game and spend all the money that he awards. Return to the King to collect another 1500 gold pieces. This may be done whenever all gold has been spent.

    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>
The game involves the player controlling Felix the Cat to defeat the evil mad professor who has kidnapped Kitty, Felix's girlfriend.

Game Mechanics:

Felix the Cat has simple game mechanics. The A button is used to jump (press repeatedly to fly or swim), and the B button is used to attack. The type of attack varies depending on the magic level. When Felix falls into the bottomless pit (past the bottom of the level) or when the game clock runs to zero, he loses a life regardless of what his magic level is.

Magic Power and Common Items:

At the upper-left corner of the screen, there is an indicator (using hearts) for how much magic power Felix has available. The magic power deplenishes by one every six seconds. It is replenished by milk jars (2 hearts per jar), hearts and F-icons (full recovery). Hearts, from the Felix head emblems, increase the magic power level by one. Depending on the type of exploration involved, there could be anywhere from one to three higher levels than the base. If another heart is collected when at the highest level, an extra life is awarded along with full recovery. The F-icons give full recovery as well as an extra life. Higher magic power levels bestow increased attack power, range, and speed, making it easier to defeat enemies. If Felix runs out of hearts on the indicator, the magic power level is reduced by one, and the heart indicator is reset to 10.

Enemies:

Felix the Cat has enemies with simple behaviors, but a large number of them. Some include moles, tree trunks, cannons, birds, fish, and even 8 boss monsters. Bullets and anything fired have two routes: a straight line or an arc that goes through the ground. Enemies generally walk horizontally at a constant speed back and forth, bounce up and down for flying enemies, or shoot something--the most complex follow Felix at a slow speed. If Felix takes a hit, his magic power goes down one level; if Felix is at the lowest magic power, he loses a life.

Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge is one-player driving/racing game where you play the role of Ferrari team driver. The main objective of the game is to become F1 Champion - during standard 16 rounds season. Your rivals are 25 computer opponents representing different F1 teams (though, maybe of the low budget of game, no real teams, 'cept Ferrari, and driver names are used - all they seem to be made up). Every round consists of qualification(1-lap) and main(5-laps) races. If you phail to qualify, no other chance is given. After every round you're given a password to continue your game with previous results achieved.  

Instead of racing for prizes, you could enter the practice mode, where you can choose the track and number of practice laps. Comes in nifty, when you're aiming for 160/160 season points.

Johnson and Berry are good fellows in the battlefield. They have experienced numerous small and large battles without fail. But this time they've been given the most difficult mission ever: their commander asked for reinforcement support for the war emergency, but the enemy's frontier military post is located along the shortcut of the reinforced army's movement. Time is urgent! The commander decided to send a guerilla soldier to destroy the enemy's frontier military post in order for the reinforcements to pass through. Johnson and Berry are the storm-troopers who are the only team with a chance for success and survival!

    <desc>This ROM hack is for those of you who already own Final Fantasy and found that it wasn't as polished as it could have been.

I have taken the liberty of "improving" upon this marvelous game, correcting as many of Nintendo's stylistic errors, graphical censorships, and mistranslations as possible. However, truth be told, Nintendo did a very good job translating Final Fantasy1. At least there were no "This guy are sick" lines. Even so, the script was rather bland and important words stuck out like a sore thumb (ORBS and LIGHT WARRIORS come to mind). By using a more optimized DTE scheme, decapitalizing 90% of the text (^_^) and streamlining the tile table (which took a lot of effort BTW!), I found that there was not only plenty of room for a full trannslation, but there was room for more! Since my Japanese skills aren't all that great yet, and since no one on the face of this planet would dare dream of translating the script for me, I decided that I would simply rewrtie the American script, putting my personal interpretive "spin" on it. The result is, I hope, a script that is more cohesive, entertaining, and logical than the original.

Please keep in mind that EXTENSIVE liberties were taken with the hack. Do not think that Nintendo cheated you out of all this information. I have heavily researched Final Fantasy I, and sought to expand on very minute, almost insignificant details. In essence, you are getting a condensed version of the story that will appear in Final Fantasy Silver.

    <desc>This is a semi-sequel (or more like an expansion pack) for my previous hack, Final Fantasy ++ (so if you haven't played that, then you really shouldn't be playing this). At any rate, this is quite a bit harder to beat than FF++, so n00bs beware. Also, one can consider this sort of a tribute to classic SquareEnix (the way they were?). It includes adaptations of various dungeons from FFs 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6, SaGa 2 (a.k.a. FF Legend 2), and Dragon Quest 5 (along with a couple of new ones by me). And, of course, lots of classic FF enemies are here for you to battle.

    <desc>Final Fantasy ++ (or Final Fantasy Double-Plus, or Final Fantasy Plus Plus) is a "re-imagining" of the very first Final Fantasy game.

What's been changed:

+ Redone graphics. (Mostly ripped from later games in the series.)
+ Redone enemies. (Many are new; some are returning enemies with new properties.)
+ Redone magic spells. (Magic is now divided into White, Black, and Time Magic.)
+ Redone weapons and armor. (Some armors now increase evasion rather than lowering it!)
+ Redone maps. (Most are similar to the original game's; some are totally new.)
+ Redone character class system. (See Read Me.txt for details.)
+ Two new pieces of music. (Adapted from Final Fantasy 4.)
+ Some other relatively minor stuff.

    <desc>I started learning how to ROM hack in the summer of 1997, and by the next summer I felt comfortable enough to start working on projects with the intent of releasing them.

The first to be completed was this hack. Fresh from beating the FF3j translation, and amazed by the release of the original DOS version of Tile Layer, I decided to make Gauntlet into a FF3j themed game.

The graphics are mostly copy/pastes from the first three FF games, with some craptastic artwork done by myself as needed?

100% of the graphics and text were altered, but there's a problem with the way I did the wall graphics (You can't see the breakable tiles, which proves to be a major pain in the ass in certain levels).

Also, there is no level, sound or assembly hacking (All beyond my abilities at the time). However, the story is kind of interesting if you liked FF3j, as it's a direct sequel to it.

- B. Belt =&gt; Lenna as the "Monk" class

- RedMage =&gt; Cecil, Paladin

- W. Mage =&gt; Plain Lenna with a cape

- B. Mage =&gt; Butz (I think) as the "Black Mage" class

- The class-changed characters are original creations, so they are not from any other game, however they may slightly resemble their former selves in most cases.

- The palette for the 16-24 character sprites (the ones you control in combat) has been changed to better colors.

- Hammers have been replace by whips.

- The starting values for chars have been grossly inflated to enable you to progress throught the game at a faster pace.

    <desc>FinalFacelift is a fun patch that changes the look, but none of the gameplay, of Final Fantasy for the NES. It's not a game itself, but only a patch file specifying minor changes.

That's a very modest description of this hack. Here's a short list of changes:

- Five letter character names
- Default names for characters
- Retranslated names for items, equipment, and monsters
- Touched up dialog
- Enhanced graphics (With censored graphics restored)

It may not seem like a lot, but it has been the base for countless Final Fantasy hacks and offers an enhanced gameplay experience on its own.

    <desc>This is an extensive improvement hack that seriously tries to take the 'wasted potential' the author saw in the game and bring it to life to make the game more appealing to all. This was accomplished mainly by balancing all aspects of the gameplay.

This patch is based on Neo Demiforce's FF2j translation.

The following are just SOME of the changes that were made. (See the Readme for the rest):

- Changed font
- Revised difficulty ramp to be more balanced
- Spells were made to be much strong and some were renamed
- Complete overhaul of monster stats
- Weapon system was revised to be more balanced and more appealing

Granted, it's not enough to get anyone excited in the Emulation Age, but this would be quite a worthy purchase back in the day. I mean, who would pay full price for Final Fantasy 2? This way, at least you get the FF1 with it too.

Translation Description:

Anyway, this isn't too exciting, just the official Final Fantasy translation and the Neo Demiforce Final Fantasy 2 translation. That's all. There was going to be a new intro for the game, but it never happened, so here we are. La.

    <desc>I can not say enough good things about this game. I love it. A lot. I didn't think I would, but look what happened! Yeah, so this game is a hell of a lot better than the first two Final Fantasy games, in almost all respects: vastly improved graphics (on par with those of FF4), a kickass soundtrack (including the coolest boss music EVER).. Basically it's just a helluva fun game. Think FF5 with less plot. When you win a battle you get Capacity points, and you can use those to change Jobs. Whenever you get to a Crystal you have get more Jobs that you can use, and, uh, stuff. This is probably my favorite Final Fantasy game out there (except for possibly FF7, but we won't get into that), and is definitely one of the best 8-bit games I have ever played. It starts out kinda rough, but once you get past the beginning, it's great. Really.

Translation Description:

This is a wonderful, well-done, professional translation. The only problem I have with it is.. Ah hell, I'm just kidding, I just can't think of things to say here. It's really great, let's just leave it at that.

    <desc>It's a Final Fantasy game! Final Fantasy 2 has all the things you've come to expect from the series: music, plot, pretty well-done character designs.. What's not to like? Well, I'll tell you. The experience/level system is done away with in FF2, and replaced with a SaGa-like system in which your character only improves in the skills that you actually use. Granted, it's very different, and you'll either like it or hate it. I really couldn't stand it the first time I played the game, but now I actually kind of like it, although it makes the game drag on a LOT in places. Of course, FF2 has numerous things that can be exploited, allowing for all kinds of cheating (some prefer the term "time-savers") to take place.. such as making an attack and then cancelling it, attacking your own teammates to raise their HP, and.. Well I can't think of anything else. Anyway, if you like this sort of thing, by all means try it out, since it is definitely a good game.

Translation Description:

Apparently this translation takes great liberties in terms of dialogue; I'm not sure of course, it's just what I've heard from various people. Regardless, it's in English, and I certainly don't mind what's done with it, as long as the "spirit" is preserved.

And anyone who tells you that the new intro isn't cool is just plain wrong.

Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.

The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland.

Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. The enemies wait until all of your party members have performed their moves, and the ATB (active-time battle) system is not used. You can buy weapons and rest in the towns, and the world map is populated by monsters, with which you will be engaged in random fights.

Before the game starts, you choose four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Blue Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes you choose for your character is entirely up to you. You also give the characters names.

Controls:

A Button: Talk, make selection
B Button: Cancel, go back
Start Button: Show status screen
Select Button: Change order of marching

Hints:

Hidden Puzzle Game
When you're on the ship, hold down the A button and press the B button 55 times to access the hidden puzzle game.

Extra Classes
The first 6 classes don't just stop there. Later on in the game, you get a secondary classes, which include Knight, Ninja, Master, White Wizard, Red Wizard, and Black Wizard.

    <desc>Kabucho informed us a week ago that he released a hack of Final Fantasy, called Quadruple Dragons. Quadruple Dragons is about four warriors that set out to revive the Four Orbs of the elements. You can choose from a Soldier, who is very strong in melee attacks, but is as dumb as a brick. The Bandit, who is very quick and is an average fighter. The Monk is very strong if you know how to use him. The Mage masters the art of black magic, while the Priest studies white magic. The Comic is useless... unless you get his character class up. In this game, all of the text, armor, weapons, magic, almost everything is changed from the original Final Fantasy. Even some of the towns and overworld map is changed.

WARNING: I got froze after saving the Princess in the beginning.  I don't know if this hack is beatable past that point.  ~Rx

In a humorous take on the eighties' sci-fi judgment day films, you either play Arnold or Sigourney in a mission to save the world. The year is 2029 and an alien invasion, led by Supreme Commander Vile Malmort, threatens the earth.

The heroes are equipped with a jet pack and two orbiting cannons. These can be set to fire in one direction or in a fixed pattern. You can fly in all directions and use power-ups to gain new types of weapons or to restore health. Only seven lives per mission are provided, but there is an unlimited amount of continues.

Note from Rx: This is the Japanese version of "S.C.A.T.: Special Cybernetic Attack Team" in the US, but the gameplay is different so it's included in the Xtras.

    <desc>This is a complete translation of Fire Emblem Gaiden, possibly one of the last in the series needing a full translation.

First note that this is NOT a fix or addendum to j2e's unfinished translation. I started with a fresh ROM and with the help of Shimizu Hitomi's translation script, made the text laconic and as close to the original as I could. I reworked the title screen and tried to fit as much as I could using the given text tiles. Everything was hand-coded from a blank slate.

To make things easier for those who already have earlier unfinished versions of the game, I included two other patches besides the pure Japanese ROM patch. Those two patches may be applied to j2e's and StarWolf's versions of the game to prevent the need of downloading a fresh Japanese ROM.

Further information is located in the readme. Have fun, and drop me a line if you find something odd. Thanks for playing!

Fire Hawk is a real treat, like a top-down Choplifter!. The gameplay is solid, very similar in ways to the "___ Strike" games. The actual rescue scenes are frought with action as well. Overall, it's a solid entry.

Gameplay:

Control Pad left/right: Swivel copter
Control Pad up: Move forward in directionf faces.
Control Pad down: 

A: Bombs
B: Gun

Select: switch between Para crosshair and Carrier crosshair
Start: Pause

This is a pretty cool little puzzle game. You are Dana, a wizard, of Coolmint Island. Coolmint has become plagued with flames and will melt if you don't get rid of them. It's a bright and colorful little game that is simple and straightforward to play. The music is simple and unobtrusive, which is the way I feel a puzzler's music should be.

Directions:

Work your way through each temple, defeating all enemies within. Create blocks of ice next to walls to secure them in space and create stairs or bridges. Drop blocks of ice down onto enemies or push loose blocks of ice into them. When you create ice with your wand, you create it at an angle in front of and below you, so you must be standing on a surface that is higher and behind where you want to create ice.

The time at the bottom of the screen is only for personal scoring and does not affect the game play. The only place where you have to worry about time is in the labyrinths. There you must destroy all enemies before the rising lava level reaches you. You cannot stop the lava with ice.

If you have made a mistake that doesn't allow you to progress any further in a level, don't panic. You aren't trapped there and you don't have to reset the game. Just press start and choose "TRY AGAIN". No worries.

Eventually you will get to tunnels that you can move through. You can move up through these. The levels get more and more difficult, sometimes requiring you to drop the enemies down by destroying the ice under them before you can destroy them. Keep trying and you will succeed! 

Controls:

A Button: Create/Destroy Ice
B Button: Create/Destroy Ice
Start Button: Start Game

Hints:

Create It Before You Break It
Make sure you really don't need a piece of ice before you destroy it. You can't get it back sometimes without restarting. Stand on top of loose pieces of ice and create a spare if you're not sure. Just make two more blocks, now there should be three, and destroy the middle one. Now you have an extra, just in case.

To play I Can Remember, you have to concentrate! Can you remember what you see? Can you remember where you saw it? Choose a number and look at the picture that's revealed underneath. Then choose another number and look at that picture. Do they match? If they do, they'll stay turned up. If they don't, they'll turn down again and your opponent gets to pick two more. Keep picking pairs until all the pictures are matched and the entire game board is uncovered. Play alone, play against a friend or even the computer. As you get better, the boards get harder, with more numbers and more pictures to remember. You can do it!

This is a platform "beat-'em-up" game based on the anim? series Hokuto no Ken. According to the story mentioned in the manual, Kenshirou, the main character, has to save the people from the evil Emperor Heaven.

The game itself, however, features no story whatsoever, but a lot of platform action instead. You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups.

This game is a sequel to the Japan only release of Hokuto no Ken

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels. They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed. Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone. Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.

It is May, 1972. Guerillas supplied by North Vietnam are threatening the U.S. backed South. President Nixon has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase air strikes against targets in Haiphong and Hanoi to disrupt the North Vietnamese war effort. The operation is known as the Linebacker Campaign.

Flight of the Intruder is played in a series of twelve missions. The missions begin on April 30, 1972 as the NVA (North Vietnamese Army) send hostile forces to attack the USS Constellation on Yankee Station. The missions increase in difficulty and deadliness as the Linebacker Campaign progresses. How will you do on each mission determines your rank at the end of the game.

The Navy used two of its finest planes during Project Linebacker, the F-4 Phantom all-weather interceptor and the A-6 Intruder all-weather carrier-based strike bomber. Your will have a chance to use both planes. As a Phantom pilot, your piloting skills will be tested as you go up against the formidable MiG 21 jets of the North Vietnamese air force.

In the seat of an A-6, you will strike at ground targets while avoiding flak and deadly ground-to-air missiles.

The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses.

When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.

The player competes in a marathon continuous scrolling horizontal shoot-em-up game across land, sea, air and outer space. You can hold down the fire button for a burst of Charged fire, which is especially essential to defeat the bosses.

The player can hold down the Jump button to transform back and forth between a Mobile Robot or an Aero Fighter. Some sections have confrontations on both ground and air; others insist on aerial battling. Your time in the Aero Fighter is limited by its fuel requirement.

By winning races, the player can upgrade parts on the Mini and have a better shot at more races. Win enough races and eventually earn the opportunity to race using faster cars. The other cars available in the game are the Vector W2, Ferrari F40, and of course, the Formula 1.

It's a pretty typical summer at Crystal Lake. There's a group of happy children staying in the Camp. You and your six Camp Counselor friends are watching over the kids while enjoying the lake and the wilderness. The days are bright and sunny. The nights are cool and clear. And Jason is on a rampage.

It's up to you to stop him, but it's not going to be easy. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood sucking bats and hordes of mindless zombies everywhere you turn. You must also help any friend who is in danger, or else you can just kiss them goodbye. And hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe won't keep you safe - Jason will find you anywhere. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason face to face, and destroy him.

--From the NES Friday the 13th instruction manual.

Overview:

While at camp, six counselors have heard the legend of Camp Blood and the boy named Jason Voorhees. They actually believe the legend, a smart move on their part. Then Jason comes back to kill everyone, and even resurrected his dead mom and victims. So now the six counselors must put an end to Jason's terror once and for all!

Directions:

You get to play as one of the six counselors, each with a different style, yet same basic moves. The object of this game is to prevent Jason Voorhees from killing anybody. But with zombies popping out of the ground, it might be difficult. You can enter cabins and row boats, too! Fight the baddies with selected weapons! 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Throw weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Access menu while in cabin

Hints:

Zombie Removal
This trick will help you to clear the paths (not in the forest) during the dusk/night hours. After killing off six Zombies, a Crow will appear in the air, coming at your Counsellor from whichever direction the Counsellor is facing (this means that it will try to fly into you). The trick is to kill Zombies while facing the opposite direction you wish to go, have the Crow appear, and then head down the path ahead of it. You will need to keep the Crow following you, so the pace will be slow, but the reward is no Zombies to deal with until you lose your Crow follower.

Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy territory and destroy their fortress. To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.

You're trapped in the FUN HOUSE! How do you find your way out?! You start the game with three rollerbladers. If you maneuver your way out of one room in the limited amount of time, you go on to the next room. But to move on, you must smack all the targets with your tomatoes as you whiz by. Pick up the power objects to gain advantages like more rollerbladers or more time.

It's a slippery, slimey trip through 72 rooms, full of blobs and boingers, flying banana chips and schmutz balls. So getting through the rooms gets harder and gooier as you go along. Have fun!

    <desc>Mirai Senshi Lios is a nifty Strategy RPG for Nes, which plays incredibly similar to Front Mission. You have command of a bunch of armored mech units, and you go out and kick your enemy's butt in with them. Basically, you have a drop ship and a commander, and so does the enemy. You either have to annihilate the enemy, or kill both the drop ship and the commander. Of course, the enemy has it lot easier when trying to kill you. See, if your comander OR your dropship goes bewm, you can forget about winning. Not a chance for you. You're just another victim of Twistied Video Game Logic.

Also, there is a plot going on underneath all the strategy stuff, which is somewhat rare in this genre (not counting Shining Force and Dark Wizard, of course). Most strategy games have no justification behind them. Take any of the Gameboy Wars games. You're just mindlessly pummeling the oppostion for... what?! What did they do to you? Why are you fighting a war? (Why do I try to think about stuff like this :P). That lack of reasoning kinda turns people off from the genre, but fortunately, this game brings a pleasant break from the strategy norm. The game is definitely worth your time, you should check it out!

Hey! Everything should be done with this game. Okay?

    <desc>The WakdHacks homepage describes Fuzzical Fighter as an RPG/Action game mix. That's completely wrong, but it shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the game. You can think of it as a side-scrolling shooter with RPG elements. As you fly around shooting stuff, you get money, which can be used between stages. You can buy new weapons or shields or engines, or you can heal yourself, or even warp to another stage if you so choose. The formula works wonderfully in this case, and while it's not a completely new concept nowadays (Tyrian's one of my favorite PC games (too bad it won't work on my computer anymore)), I'm sure that it seemed quite cool at the time, and it's still great fun to play.

Translation Description:

What's to say? It looks great! Just play the game already.

The "Galaga" are an unknown alien, which has an insect shape. They fly in formation and begin attacking. The boss "Galaga," in the highest position, is the only one capable of shooting the tractor-beam. If the boss "Galaga" is destroyed, the remaining "Galagas" attack power is temporarily weakened.

--From the NES Galaga instruction manual.

Overview:

Shoot and destroy alien spaceships that are attacking you in this arcade classic!

Galaga is the super smash hit sequel to Galaxian. Galaga made it to the big time as soon as it hit the arcades. People instantly fell in love. Galaga was ported very well from the old arcade machines to the Nintendo console. Galaga is one of the biggest classic arcade games of all time. When you ask people which arcade games were the biggest in the 80's, they will probably say, Centipede, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, or Galaga. They even had a machine that had Galaga and Ms. Pac Man together. If you are a fan of arcade classics or space shooters, you'll love this game!

Directions:

Simply shoot all the spaceships that you see. You may have to move around to avoid getting attacked. 

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: N/A

Hints:

Don't give up!
If a Galaga's tractor beam starts pulling you in, you will spin about, but you will still be able to shoot at enemies. If you happen to end up shooting upward and destroy the Galaga before you are captured, you will just drop back into play.

Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.

    <desc>
Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).

A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player ("Hey!", "Excuse me!", "Watch it!"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.

This is a mini-translation. Once the font was changed to an English font set, I had discovered that the text was in Romanized Romaji, thus the intro and some of the ending needed translated.

Hoonokatana translated the scripts, so thanks to him.

I have done some minor ASM hacking to this game such as adding punctuation. Merely adding the punctuation font tiles would not work. Also, slowing down the intro text so that it's easier to read.

Sequel to Ganbare Goemon!, Goemon 2 puts you back in the shoes of Goemon as he traverses feudal Japan looking to bring justice to any corrupt baddies he may find. 

Joining Goemon in his adventure is the wacky ninja Ebisumaru which allows for simultaneous 2-player gameplay, marking the biggest difference in terms of gameplay with the original. The game keeps the straightforward side-scrolling beat 'em up formula and even removes some of the maze-like elements in the previous game, adding new weapons and upgrades to make the game more action-oriented. Wandering through the stages is still possible and you can enter several stores and locations and trigger amusing humorous sequences keeping in tone with the lighthearted spirit of the series.

    <desc>Let's just get this out of the way here: Goemon kicks ass. Ass. Do you hear. Okay. You may remember this fellow from a few games (three I think) called Mystical Ninja. But there were a whole HELL of a lot more in Japan. Yup. This is the first one. It's pretty simple, but it's fun, so yay. You run around and smack people (but not the ladies, please) and collect three passes to move on. I guess Goemon's this hero fellow who gives to the poor and stuff, but it's hard to tell. You can upgrade your shoes to run faster, and you get a slingshot, and a candle so you can see hidden stairways, and a whole hell of a lot of items that I don't know WHAT they're used for, and this sentence doesn't make much sense. Just play the game dammit. Geez.

This was released about three years ago, and it was just now discovered that the ending was not translated. So here's a new patch, with a translated ending!

Demon - warrior - hero!

A long time ago, between the age of the dinosaurs and the dawn of mankind, there existed the magical world of Etruria. A local monster named Firebrand from the Ghoul Realm was busy training in the arts of the warrior. He is a young and powerful gargoyle - human in shape, yet he has leathery wings with massive claws on his hands and feet.

He studies at the Warrior's Training Center to use his combat talents in defense of the Ghoul Realm. His time comes (sooner than he expected), as a mysterious black light appeared one day and drained the magic from the land.

--From the NES Gargoyle's Quest 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

A great sequel to a great game. Again, the mix of RPG elements and action platforming works surprisingly well. The graphics and game-play are very similar to the Game Boy original, but in color. The music and sound effects are much improved, though still not great. As always with the Ghosts 'n Goblins series, it's the fun and challenge of Gargoyle's Quest that will hook you in and stay with you.

Step back into the mazes of the Dark Dungeons with Thor, Thyra, Questor and Merlin. With over 100 new mazes to explore, experience all the action, graphics, and sound of the arcade. Use your powers to fend off your old enemies - ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, and sorcerers - along with a couple of new ones. As you delve deeper into the dungeons, you'll become enthralled with the world of Gauntlet II.

--From the NES Gauntlet 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

Okay, so there's not much of a story here. An evil wizard has built this huge dungeon for some reason, and these four heroes have to get through it... to save the world, I guess? Anyway, it's Gauntlet. The graphics are a hair better in this edition. The graphics look about the same as the first installment with a little more attention to the shadows. The sounds were nice because there isn't much BG music, which I've never been a big fan of. The sound effects were comical at times, especially when you find food. The gameplay is fun just like the original. It's nice to play a sequel and not have to relearn to play the game. The controls are easy to use, but they are a little slow. This game is an enjoyable classic, and if you like Gauntlet, you'll love this chapter in the series.

Directions:

Choose from 4 different classes of fighters: Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, or Elf. Choose one at the screen using the arrows. They are all pretty much the same, except for the way they look. All the weapons are thrown, there is no melee. The real object of this game is to get to the EXIT. Most monsters will come from a generator, which can be destroyed, which is a good idea! You will find food (refills your life), a key (opens locked passages), or liquor bottles (refills your life). Sometimes you will find a chest, inside you will find either food or the grim reaper who will try to kill you. Don't spend too much time looking for chests though, because your life will always be slowly decreasing, so get to the end of the level quickly!

Controls:

A Button: Use item at bottom of screen
B Button: Throw weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Pause/Unpause

Hints:

Open all doors
To have every door in the level open without using any keys, simply stand still and do nothing for a couple minutes. All doors in the level will then be unlocked.

Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic.

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest.

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route. Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level. Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.

Story:

In a land known as Rendar, Morak, a hooded devil-like creature, has stolen the Sacred Orb that protected the lands. He hid this along with other treasures he stole in the Gauntlet which is protected by his evil creatures. Of the four heroes from the original Gauntlet only two were able to enter the portal and go after the Sacred Orb.

Gameplay:

As with most early Gauntlet games the player is seen from above, keys must be found to open doors, and closed treasure chests. Potions and keys can be found throughout the levels, however unlike the Arcade version the doors will not unlock on their own, after a period of time has passed. Although the Unlicensed version states "The #1 Arcade game!", there are many differences between the Arcade and NES versions, one of the biggest being the helpful hints provided from a Dungeon Master type voice are missing from the NES version; however, the grunts and "Ummm" sounds of players getting hurt or enjoying food can still be heard.

The player can choose any of the original four players that were in the arcade version, Thor, Thyra, Merlin, and Questor; each varies with respect to magic power, shot power, hand-to-hand fighting skill, armor and movement speed. Gathering gold can increase these powers like experience points, and there are also specialized potions that permanently increase these abilities slightly. Temporary abilities can also be acquired from box shaped items that grant enemy-repulsing power, invisibility, invulnerability, super shots and reflective shots.

A map of each land is shown between the stages. There are five worlds to journey through: Castle, Forest, Caverns, Water, and Volcano. In each area the walls are made to look like different kinds of blocks; trees, brick, rock, crystal rock, and invisible (water levels). A new addition to the Gauntlet style of play is that the NES version has pushable walls.

Besides the normal fighting maze levels there are also two other types of rooms. In treasure rooms, collecting treasures will build up the players' experience and allow them to have more maximum health points, stronger attacks, and greater speed. These abilities grow every 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 treasures, but if the player gets more than 2,000 treasures the password they are given won't work.[1] No enemies are in the treasure rooms, but health is regained only when the exit is found before time runs out, thus limiting the amount of treasures that can be collected. A password will appear after exiting the treasure room if the room is exited before the timer expired. The other type of room is the Clue Room, of which there are eight throughout the game. Once inside these rooms the player must find a question mark '?' tile and exit before a timer runs out, in order to get a part of a combination that will unlock the 100th level. After finding the '?' and exiting, "Morak will appear and give you a clue."[2] The player must navigate around stun tiles, trap floors which flash and cause walls to disappear when stepped on, and teleporters that send them to different places depending on which direction the player enters them from. The password system proved troublesome for players as some characters, such as 'h' and 'k', 'S' and '5', and 'l' and '1', looked very similar.

Trivia:

After the release of Gauntlet on the NES, three juveniles in Pompano Beach, Florida were arrested for behavior they claim was motivated by the game. The youths attacked an elderly couple by throwing toy axes and flaming trash. The event caused a minor stir in the local media.

Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

    <desc>I thought I was good at side-scrolling games until I played this. Anyone who thinks they kick ass at side-scrollers needs to play this and be forever humbled. It's hard. Incredibly hard. This game is difficult to the point of Unfair. However, it still manages to be fun to play. There's a basic overworld, which consists of your Hero moving along predetermined paths to event squares, where you can have some fortune-telling old hag laugh at you, or buy items from a guy with Tourette's Syndrome, or go and get your ass kicked in one of the side-scrolling stages. I wish I knew what the items did, but I'm too lazy to find out. Well anyway, I guess this is your standard NES game in the same vein as Castlevania - you'll die frequently, hurl your controller at the TV and swear to never play the game again, and then you'll just try again the next day.

Based on the movie of the same name, something strange is going on in New York City and the Ghostbusters are back and armed with "benevolent slime" to find out what it is. The ghostbusters quest, like in the movie, takes them to an underground river of slime, ghostly hauntings in the courthouse, an abandoned subway line. These action sequences are interspersed with driving sequences with the Ghostbusters car, Ecto-1A Finally, the Ghostbusters must bring the Statue of Liberty to life through the New York Harbor and then navigate it through the city streets. This leads to a final confrontation with a painting come-to-life, Virgo the Carpathian in which all 4 ghostbuster members must fight their way into the museum.

In the action sequences you control a single ghostbuster who can fire his slime weapon and jump. In driving sequences you move the Ecto-1A around the screen and your controls are also a slime gun and jumping. Additionally you must find speed arrows on the ground to jump over huge chasms. Finally, while controlling the Statue of Liberty you may fire her torch straight up into the air (find a power-up torch to shoot diagonally) or let loose the tablet that she carries to destroy all enemies on the screen.

Find 20 "Ghostbusters 2" symbols in any of these levels to obtain an extra life.

Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.

Our beautiful Princess is kidnapped. Her lover, the Knight, armed with five different weapons, must pass through seven guarded gates to successfully rescue the princess.

The Knight needs your skill to rescue the Princess to cunningly maneuver escapes from Hades, land of the enemies.

--From the NES Ghosts 'n Goblins instruction manual.

Overview:

Save your girlfriend from the demon (Asutaroto) that kidnapped her in the middle of your picnic. Not much of a story, true, but that's not the point. The point is, this is a really fun game.

Ghosts 'n Goblins was a pretty good conversion from the arcade game to the NES. The enemies are well drawn and tough. The sound in this game was pretty good, with only a couple of annoying ones. Overall a very good effort by the folks at Capcom.

Directions:

This was probably the hardest game ever made for the NES. You get two hits per man, and you only start with two men. To top it all off, you have to make it through the game twice. The enemies surround you and and they'll drop down on you from above. If that wasn't enough, some of them have ranged weapons. Although, there is a myriad of weapons you can get to help you on your way: torches, javelins, swords and axes. Altogether it was a fun game, but I wouldn't try to beat it, it will consume you like fire through a dry wheat field in a high wind.

While taking the usual shortcut home through the cemetery from Cool School High, Senior Spike O'Hara found a strange, glowing skull. He put it in his backpack to show to his anatomy teacher the next day which happened to be Halloween Eve. When Dr. Femur wanted to keep the skull for a special study, Spike was concerned because it appeared that the skull was bigger than it was the day before. Little did anyone know that the skull had begun transmitting its message to the realm of the dead. The ghouls had begun their assault...

Ghosts/demons have taken over Cool School High. They have turned the teachers and football team into demons. To make matters worse, they have kidnapped Samantha Pompom, the head cheerleader. The player assumes the role of Spike O'Hara as he tries to defeat the ghouls and rescue Samantha. He will have to explore more than 200 rooms and defeat a large number of enemies. There are items and weapons throughout the game that O'Hara can find to defeat the ghouls, though many of these items are well-hidden.

Weapons:

Baseball Bat - Spike begins the game with this weapon. 
Towel - Extra reach gives an advantage. 
Deweytron - First of three anti-ghoulie guns. 
Digestaray - Gun that packs a harder punch. Useful against floor bound enemies. 
Sickle - Acquired from the Grim Reaper. 
Spinal Zap - One of the most powerful weapons. Sparks up a ghoul's future. 
Sandwich - Great throwing weapon for foodfights! 
Embalming Fluid - Very powerful chemical against the living dead. 
Gamma Gun - Third and most powerful gun. 

Shoes:

Sneakers - Spike begins game with these. 
Spring Shoes - Help to reach high places or make dangerous jumps. 
Suction Cup Shoes - Gives the ability to walk on the ceiling.

    <desc>
G.I. Joe's squad of mean, lean combat experts moves into action! Cobra Commander has raised the ancient island of Atlantis from the ocean depths, and is using it as a base.

With a nearly indestructible army, and powerful space weapons, the power-crazed Cobra is about to take over the world! Advance through the lethal mazes of Cobra's weapons complex, battling soldiers, gunships, laser orbs, and skin-shredding birds of prey. Infiltrate secret storerooms where Cobra Commander carries out his deadly schemes. At each level, find an ally of even greater strength and skill to join your combat team.

At last, face Cobra Commander himself in a treacherous duel for world dominance! This is a fight only G.I. JOE can win!

Storyline:

Cobra Commander somehow survived the last time he fought the G.I. Joe team and this time he is plotting to use the long lost powers of the Atlanteans in his bid to rule the world. The game's format is similar to that of Capcom's Bionic Commando series with an overhead map of the various sub-stages, and bosses (Overkill, Cesspool, Firefly, Major Bludd, Destro) located at Cobra bases sprinkled throughout the game. Cobra Commander is the final boss at the end of the game once again.

Game Characters:

There are several playable characters in the game, each with his own unique style and abilities. Once players have discovered a character, they can 'decide' which characters will come with them, and alternate between them during gameplay by pressing the "pause" button and accessing the pause menu. Each character has their own agility, stamina and strength rating, although they are not shown unlike the previous game.

The playable characters available are General Hawk, Wet Suit, Storm Shadow, Road Block, Duke and Snake-Eyes.

Snake Eyes is one of five characters you will use in your long battle. Receive vital information transmitted from Joe headquarters by General Hawk.

Cling to walls while dodging a barrage of enemy fire. Find gun symbols to power up your massive arsenal of weapons. Catch enemy vehicles like the BuzzBoar. Fight the Cobra SeaRay, one of many enemy bosses!

Gameplay:

The player takes control of a team of three G.I. Joe characters, each with their own specialty. The player's goal is to navigate through six stages (with several areas each) on a mission to finally bring down Cobra. The initial character roster consists of Duke, Snake-Eyes, Blizzard, Captain Grid-Iron, and Rock 'n Roll. A sixth character, Hawk, becomes available only for the final stage. Each character leads the team at least once in the entire game, meaning that one character in the given area would be chosen by default. The player would then select the two other operatives to complete their team.

The player collects power-ups in the game that increases an individual character's abilities. Gun icons increases firepower, K-rations recovers energy, and Chevron icons increases the current character's maximum stamina. Bullet icons refills the player's collective ammunition and bulletproof vest icons that grant temporary invincibility are also available at designated locations on each area. Icons flashing in red are more valuable than ordinary icons. All upgrades garnered during the course of the game are permanent, provided of course the character survives the mission.

Certain areas have empty enemy vehicles that the main character can operate. The three different vehicles available are the Buzz Boar, the Pogo, and the Battle Copter. The player can still plant bombs while riding these vehicles.

The format of each stage is broken up into three different areas, which follows the following formula: In the first area, the player's team would fight their way into one of Cobra's bases. In the second area, the player's team has to plant a certain number of bombs inside the base before a pre-determined amount of time. The final area of the stage is a fight with the base's commander. The Cobra soldiers and bosses are all based on characters from the toyline.

Playable Characters:

There are five initial characters in the game (with a sixth character that becomes available for the final stage), each with his strength to bring to the game. The player can choose a team of three for each area. During gameplay, the player can switch between characters after pausing the game. The characters' skills are agility, stamina, strength and firepower.[1]

Duke  The most balanced, possessing the mid-level skills and powers of his comrades. 

Snake-Eyes  Can jump higher and punch/throw faster than his teammates. He is also the only one who does not use up any ammunition, using white fireballs instead. While being able to conserve vital ammunition, Snake-Eyes' weapon is weak. 

Capt. Grid-Iron  Has the greatest fist power and is average in other departments. He is very similar to Duke, but with a shorter jump and a smaller spread weapon. 

Rock 'n Roll  He has the strongest firepower and the widest range of all but all his other ratings below average. 

Blizzard - He is sub-par in most skills except stamina. Blizzard may come in handy during the Antarctic world, but otherwise does not stand out in any specific areas, though his throwing speed is almost as fast as Snake-Eyes. His special ability is that he can shoot through solid walls. 

General Hawk  His appearance is based on the 1991 edition of his action figure. He is the only character who can fly and a requirement when facing Cobra Commander. He only becomes available for use in the final stage. In the course of the game, he was kidnapped by Destro and Rock 'n Roll led a team of operatives to rescue him from the desert.

    <desc>
Gilligan's Island is a pretty neat little adventure/puzzler game. The graphics and sound aren't great, but then, you don't need them to be. That's not the point. The point is to wander around and find the clues to solve each episode, while having a little action thrown in to keep things exciting. Of course, most of what you do is avoid fights, because there are only certain ones that you need to win, and those require plot points to provide the right weapon to beat the fight. Other than that, it's a matter of keeping the Skipper alive and not letting Gilligan get lost.

Directions:

You are the Skipper, and your task is to help the shipwrecked crew of the Minnow survive and escape the island. As an added bonus, Gilligan follows you around to 'help' you, but he mostly gets himself and you into trouble, so you have to keep him safe. Also, you have to keep him close by, because the Skipper can't collect clues from the other Islanders if Gilligan isn't with him.

To get through each episode, you must first locate all the Crew Members, including the Professor, Mary Anne, and Mr. and Mrs. Howell, then follow the clues they give you to complete a specified task. The task and initial clues are given at the beginning of the episode in a conversation between the Skipper and the Islanders.

Use the Map to check your location and the locations of the Islanders you have located so far. You have to talk to them in a specific order to follow their clues, and of course there is a time limit, so if you have to backtrack do it as quickly as you can. If the Skipper gets low on Energy he can use Food from the main menu, and if he needs to find Gilligan in a hurry he can use the Rope.

So take Gilligan's Island for a spin, and have a little puzzle-solving fun. The real puzzle, I think, is why Ginger didn't make it onto the game.

    <desc>Damn Nintendo of America and their damned anti-RPG ways. If not for the Big N, maybe this gem of series (which consist of two Nes, two Snes, and one Gameboy game, possibly more on the next-gen systems) may have seen the light of day in North America.

Anyway, The Glory of Heracles 2 is truly a feather in Data East's cap (Which is certainly a plus given that they are the company that produces the abomination known as Bad Dudes). What Heracles 2 does is basically take the game engine behind Dragon Warrior 2, improve the graphics, add a dash of Greek Mythology and mix it all up. Sure, maybe the geography isn't quite right (Athens and Minoa, on the same landmass? Where's Crete?), and maybe some of the mythology is a bit off... but hey, it's a game. It doesn't have to be real. If I wanted it to be that real I'd read an atlas and check out the Mythology section of the library. What it is, is FUNand that's what counts.

Translation Description:

Toma did an excellent job with this one. The font is really nifty-looking, and the script is well-written. So, um, play it, and hurray!

Goal! Two is the sequel to Goal!. It is a football/soccer game for one or two players and changed the top-down perspective from the first game to an angled overhead point of view with a scrolling screen. Play modes include a single-player "Super Cup" tournament and several single-game options, including two players against the CPU.

Eight additional teams have been added, increasing the roster to 24, but some club teams have been taken out. The game modes include Exhibition Match and Super Cup (tournament). The 2-on-2 Shootout mode from the previous game has been removed. A new ability allows the player to choose 11 players from a squad of 15, with different characteristics.

The clock ticks down. The roar of the crowd rises in a deafening chant of "U-S-A! U-S-A!" Suddenly, your winger breaks free, and spots the open man in the middle. Pass... shot... GOAL!

It's America's favorite new sport, soon to become your favorite new home video game, thanks to Jaleco! Because GOAL! brings soccer to life like you've never seen it. You play with a full team of 11 players, each one rated in 7 different skill categories. You can match them against a team controlled by the computer or another player. You can even team up with a friend and match your combined skills against the best computer team. So if you want soccer at its best, tune in to the undisputed champion of home soccer software: GOAL!

Gameplay:

The game has four modes: World Cup, Tournament, Shoot Competition, and Vs. Mode. The object of the game is the same as in real football; one team must score more goals than the other to win.

In World Cup mode, players must choose one of sixteen international football teams and compete to advance to the finals. The teams are: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Uruguay, United States, and the USSR. 

In Tournament mode, players must choose one of eight American teams and compete in a standard single elimination tournament. 

In Shoot Competition mode, players must choose one of three characters and try to score as many shots out of five as possible. 

In Vs. Mode, two human players face off against each other. 

When playing World Cup or Tournament mode with two players, the players can either play on the same team or against each other.

The earth is besieged by Godzilla and monsters, and is in a critical situation. Who will be the ultimate winner, human wisdom or the instincts of the monsters? A highly challenging yet simple simulation game to play!

Just choose the commands from the "pop-up" menu and all operations can be done easily. Concentrate on your battle strategy and destroy all the enemy monsters on the earth. Popular monsters are up against the newest "smart" weapons! As the commander of the Allied Defense Forces, you place those controversial smart weapons on the map. Fire and attack as you see fit. There are even some monsters that come to the aid of the Allied Defense Forces!

Monsters:

Godzilla: The titular and most common monster, and one of the most powerful. If Godzilla seeks out an H-Bomb, he will end the game. 

Baragon: A tunneling creature, special ability is to dig underground and become invisible, but he can be detected by a radar car. 

Rodan: A flying, highly mobile monster. Rodan can heal if he is over a volcano. Also, he will be weak if he's on the ground. 

Hedorah: A monster made of polluted slime. In water he is invincible and almost always, heal. 

King Ghidorah: Three-headed space dragon, possibly the most powerful monster. 

Mothra: A moth-styled monster, also appears in larva form. Initially an enemy, but in later missions becomes a friendly unit if the player finds its egg. 

Oodako: A giant octopus. Only appears in the ocean, never moves from its location, and is the weakest monster in the game. 

UFO: A UFO. Fires beams that can initially be reflected with the Super X2's laser, but in later missions is so powerful that it punches right through.

In 2XXX A.D. when the orbits of Pluto and Neptune exchange their positions, the earth receives a declaration of war from an unknown planet. The invaders from Planet X attack the earth as part of their plan to conquer the entire universe using a legion of space monsters.

The earth sends Godzilla, king of the monsters on the earth, and Mothra, to defend itself. Godzilla advances from battle stages called Ring Fields provided in interplanetary space to battle that legion of space monsters controlled by Planet X. Godzilla must battle its way from one Ring Field to another, and finally defeat Ghidora at Planet X to defend the earth. For the sake of the future of the earth, Godzilla's fierce battle now begins....
--from the NES Godzilla instruction manual

Gameplay:

GMoM features two playable characters, Godzilla and Mothra. The player uses both monsters in turn by selecting the desired creature on a virtual gameboard, representative of the planet it is on, and moving it like a chess piece. Each space is a hexagon that represents playable, side-scrolling levels.

Monsters:

Godzilla: One of the playable characters. He can attack with his claws, feet, tail, or atomic breath. He's slow but powerful. By the game's end, Godzilla's life bar and energy bar are equal to those of MechaGodzilla and King Ghidorah. In the American version of the game, Godzilla can move by two hexagonal spaces per turn, but could only move by one space in the original Japanese version. 

Mothra: The other playable monster. She can fire small 'pellet' shaped energy balls from her eyes and spread poison from her wings. She can fly around and move quickly, but is quite weak. Mothra, on the hexagonal movement screen could move four spaces in the American version of the game, and two in the Japanese version. 

Gezora: A monster from Space Amoeba never featured in the Godzilla series. He's a giant cuttlefish with weak offense and defense. His only method of attack is to slap his opponent with a forward projecting tentacle 

Moguera: the mechanical beast who first appeared in the Mysterians and the design of which is used in the game. He fires heat beams from his eyes and tends to retreat a lot. 

Varan: This monster only made one small cameo in the series, but he had his own movie, Varan the Unbelievable. Varan is a melee fighter who punches, kicks, and has a powerful tackle attack. 

Hedorah: The first enemy monster original to the series to show up in the game, the Smog Monster launches globules of condensed smog and attacks with his tentacle-hands. In addition to his final form, a sprite of Hedorah's flying form is shown in the ending of the game, though it does not appear elsewhere (at least not in the North American release). 

Baragon: This one also only made a small cameo. He is too short to hit easily, but he attacks with fire beams and a jumping horn attack. Baragon has moments of random silliness in the game, often taking time out from the fight to turn and look directly at the player and smile, as if mocking the person controlling his opponent and effectively breaking the fourth wall. 

Gigan: Another actual Godzilla-series fiend. His eye can fire lasers, and he has a rotating buzzsaw in his chest. When activated, the blades extend to cause damage. This is a different means of use for the weapon than in the three films Gigan has thus far appeared in. Gigan has a unique animation in the game. Certain blows to Gigan's lower body will cause him to bend over as it he had been struck in the groin. 

Mechagodzilla: He has mostly the same physical attacks as Godzilla, a powerful optic blast, and a large amount of life compared to most other monsters. He and King Ghidorah and Godzilla will end the game with exactly the same levels of life and energy by the time players reach the final stage in the game. Mechagodzilla first appears on Pluto (Pluto was before Neptune when the game was made, Pluto's orbit takes it inside Neptune's orbit at two points), and then appears on Neptune and Planet X. 

King Ghidorah: A large and powerful beast from many of the series' movies. He fires lightning beams (instead of his normal gravity beams) and attacks with what the game manual refers to as 'neck punches' (in reality he is essentially slamming his heads into the heroic monsters and may or may not be biting as well, since there are no real animations for his mouths, unlike Godzilla, Varan, Gigan, MechaGodzilla, and Baragon. Ghidorah is the final opponent in the game and unlike the other monsters, never moves from his position at the enemy base, forcing players to travel the length of the Planet X game board to fight him. he is extremely powerful, having the same amount of power and life as Godzilla and MechaGodzilla by the end of the game and is a serious threat to both of the player monsters, as he likes to corner opponents on the left side of the screen and attack relentlessly, making defeating him very difficult even for experienced players of the game. 

Matangos, Dogoras, and Gohtens appear in the Hyperspace hexes.

Gold Medal Challenge '92 was a 1992 video game by Capcom. It was an Olympic sports game loosely based on the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. It heavily relied on button mashing style games. This game is also notable for its capability to have 8 human competitors to compete in the Olympiad concurrently against each other (although only 2 at a time).

Nintendo GOLF lets you choose your clubs, change your stance, control your swings - even select the angle of impact! You'll view the hole from both close up and far away, judge the changing conditions of the green, and measure the wind velocity.

But watch out! When the wind changes, so does the flight of your ball. With Nintendo's state-of-the-art graphics and realistic game play, you'll really believe you're on the fairways. So play Nintendo GOLF, because there's not a video golf game on par with it anywhere!

He's Golgo 13, the legendary agent who's never failed on a mission. Now, he's facing his toughest challenge: to recover a stolen vial of "Cassandra G," the deadliest weapon in the history of biological warfare.

But he can't do it without your help. Join forces with Golgo 13 on an action-packed odyssey to recapture Cassandra G before it is unleashed on the human race. Whether he succeeds or not is up to you - and every second counts!

Nintendo Censorship:

What is lesser known about the US release of the game is that DREK "empire" is actually the resurrected Nazi regime - Nintendo removed all Nazi references. The final boss, Smirk, is supposed to be a cyborg version of Adolf Hitler. The removal of all Nazi/Hitler references can be likened to NES game Top Secret: Hitler no Fukkatsu (Bionic Commando in the US).

Although Nintendo of America attempted to remove all Nazi references, some escaped censor. For example, a file retrieved by Togo during a base infiltration in Greece retains a swastika on it, which is visible in the player's inventory area.

It should be noted that Nintendo required that Golgo had his profession changed to spy rather than assassin.

Sexual Themes, Violence and Smoking:

Golgo 13 is one of the first Nintendo games to feature sex, drug use and graphic violence, an unusual release because at the time, Nintendo of America had strict content guidelines preventing the release of such content on its systems. Although the depictions were either implied or limited by the 8 bit technology of the NES, the content is mild when compared to modern video games, and was not controversial at the time of its release.

In the maze levels featured in the game, as well as one "sniper mode" mission in East Berlin, enemies are seen briefly bleeding from the head when killed. While the depiction is fairly tame due to the limited technology, most NES games at this time did not feature blood.

In the beginning of the mission in Greece, if the player walks to the right several paces and then walks back to the beginning of the level, a pack of cigarettes is seen on the ground - Golgo 13 is seen smoking if the player walks over the cigarettes, and his health is restored.

Throughout his lengthy mission, Golgo 13 encounters many female operatives who not only offer intelligence, but also themselves. The actual depiction of sexual consummation takes the shape of two small and primitive shaped silhouettes briefly coming together and voyeuristically viewed from a distant, wide-angle shot of hotel room window. In a strangely comedic twist, the player's energy is restored in the morning.

In the sequel, The Mafat Conspiracy, scenes are even more 'graphic' taking into consideration the technology of the time.

Welcome to Slime City

They're back! Kookie old Ma Fratelli and her slime-ball sons have returned to wreak havoc in your neighborhood. And this time they've not only kid- napped your Goonie buddies, but your good friend, Annie the Mermaid, as well. What a bunch of low lifes, this Fratelli Gang.

Now it's up to you, the last Goonie left, to save the day. But it won't be easy. You'll have to be a quick thinker and a fast tracker to pull off this mission - you'll have to be a regular Super Goonie to succeed! So good luck, and good riddance to Ma, her boys, and all the scuzzy cohorts awaiting your adventure into the Fratelli zone.

--From the NES Goonies 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

This game is meant as a sequel to the movie, The Goonies. Mikey is the main hero of The Goonies movies who, in this game, must save the other Goonies from the Fratelli family. You also have to save Annie the Mermaid. Can you do it?!

Directions:

You basically go back and forth on a board collecting power-ups and meeting weirdo characters such as Fishman and Konamiman. You also face some easy and tough villains! You have weapons such as a yo-yo, a slingshot, a boomerang, and bombs! Collect armor like the helmet and vests. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use weapon
Start Button: Show map and menu
Select Button: Pause/Unpause

Hints:

All items and Goonies

Here I go yet again with another game released in Japan for the Famicom, but yet not in America or elsewhere. This one is a really disappointing mistake when one considers the popularity of the film in this country. Why it was not released, I really don't know, but it wasn't and the only way you may come across it is if you're lucky enough to find a Supervision cartridge somewhere. This game is normally stock on the 52-in-1. At any rate, allow me to now go ahead with the brief review.

Gameplay:

Any of you that are familiar with Goonies II (and you should be), will feel right at home with this game and will see how the second upgrades the original. Unlike the sequel, this game focuses more on action and does not involve collecting items to get to different locations. You run straight though the levels looking for items, yes, but not in the same way.

Levels are straightforward. You run around, defeat enemies (staying away from the Fratellis), collect bombs, blow up doors, and get what's inside. There are also secret items hidden around (like diamonds) that you normally jump to locate, but other than that it is pretty simple. When you blow up the various doors you will either find a Goonie, a key, slingshot, or a life potion. You need to find all the Goonies and all three keys on every level to advance. Once you have done this the music will change briefly, and you can go to the exit. This is normally easy to find, as it will have some sort of impassable barrier that you can't get buy unless you've found everything. Beat all the levels and beat the game, really simple. Fans of games like Kid Icarus will enjoy this, but play even for the history value so you can see why Goonies II is Goonies II.

Control:

Really simple, the control pad does the obvious, as do Start and Select. ''A'' is for jump, and ''B'' is for kick or shoot (slingshot bullets). You can also jump and then kick, but that's all. To use bombs, duck and press ''B.'' You can only store one bomb at a time, so remember this. Bottom line, it's very easy to get used to and the controls are not awkward in the slightest, you'll have no problem with them.

    <desc>Mikhail Gorbachev, born March 2, 1931, was the last leader of the Soviet Union, serving from 1985 until its collapse in 1991. This game makes a joke that his master plan is actually to take over Japan and that he is going to do this by running a big oil pipeline from his oil fields in Russia to Japan.

The goal of the game is to complete a certain number of pipes from the blue liquid on the right side of the screen to the empty pipes on left. Some stages have less empty pipes and some have less water pipes from the right. Each level contains 9 stages. Each stage goes faster than the previous stage until you finish the level. In level 1 you have to make 2 pipes. In level 2, you have to make 3 pipes.

Two Russian children are the people who are building the pipeline. To make the pipes, you use tiles made out of groups of 2 pipe segments that the boy drops from the top. The segments contain straight pipe segments and 90 degree angle pipe segments

Translation Description:

I did this quick little translation to get me into the mood to work on translations again. harmony7 suggested the humorous subtitle. It's Compile's previous attempt to Puyo Puyo to make a Tetris clone, in terms of gameplay. As you've probably never heard of this one, it's obviously not as good. But, it is worth playing if you like these types of games.

It's just you now... you're alone... no one to turn to for help. Sure, the odds are against you, but this is when you can really show your stuff. You've got your Nintendo Zapper in your hand and a pretty good supply of paint pellets. Don't waste any, 'cause you'll need them all! Your opponents are all around and they're good shots. Whether you're in the dense green woods, the steamy urban ghetto, or the snow covered winter forest, there's only one thing on your mind... survival. Register a hit on an enemy player and mark him with a paint splot. Watch out though, because in this game they shoot back and the only way to be safe is to shoot first and shoot straight.

    <desc>The original game is Oishinbo c. 1989 by Shinsei , T. Kariya, A Hanasaki, Shogakukan, and U. Company licensed for Famicom / Nintendo. This title translates as "Gourmet," graphic and text adventure game based on the popular manga comic book series "Oishinbo." This IPS translation patch was created so that you can play this game in English on a eight bit NES emulator.

Who knew a game about food could be interesting? Before you can even say kawahagi(filefish) or fugu (blowfish), you too can become an enthusiast of the culinary arts of Japan. You won't have to watch Iron Chef to know the difference between foie gras and ankimo (monkfish liver). Follow the exploits of Shiro Yamaoka with the help of intern Yuko Kurita to find the best entr?e for the Tozai Publishing 100th Anniversary banquet. Enjoy this translation which has been lightly enhanced for playability (no MSG!)

Gradius starts off by showing us what can be done with the genre. We're able to pick which weapons you'd like by selecting a weapon path. For instance, the level three weapon could either be a laser or a ripple depending on what path you chose. The laser is more condensed, doing more damage per target while the ripple hits a larger area for less damage. Same goes for bombs and the direction in which our gun shoots. There are bombs that drop straight down and other bombs that spread across the screen. Leveling up your weapons comes at the price of systematically collecting ruby balls encapsulated in a metal exterior.

Further down the road on the weapon path are small, red balls that we can choose called "Options." Options allow for us to have double the fire power and are very effective when we start stacking them on top of each other (I.E two or three of them at once.) Finally, the path ends on a mysterious note with a "?." The question mark denotes the force field will allow for us to take more damage from flying projectiles. Now that we know what each type of weapon does, we're able to progress into the game.

In the beginning level, walls of torrid lava explode from burning stars and begin jumping across the screen in an attempt to weed-out careless gamers. Crimson meteorites bombard us from the deepest reaches of space while we try to press further in the level. Suddenly the screen turns black and an enormous bird appears from the darkness. "A Boss' we say to ourselves as this screeching monstrosity flies onto the screen daunting all forth comers.

Only to our dismay will this 'boss' go down in a matter of seconds. This is Gradius' weak point: the bosses are horrible facile and anticlimactic when compared to the rest of the game. Konami knew this too, or they surely wouldn't have pressed us against a brutal gauntlet of simple bosses. These disappointments rear their ugly heads at the end of every level. Traversing deep within the belly of the beast for almost ten minutes leads us to nothing more than a brain who fires dozens of floating bubbles and that's it. Bosses are suppose to be the hallmark of the shooter genre. Konami clearly forgot to do their homework.

The people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them.

Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.

Gradius was one of the first really popular space shooters. It was a revolutionary new type of game which ended up spawning many others. While not as fun as some of its sequels, Gradius still manages to pack a punch.

The graphics are amazing for the time. On it's own it looks like a very well-done Nintendo game. But more astoundingly is the fact that it's an arcade-perfect port. Your ship is small, but quite detailed. Some weapons are your ship's size or smaller. But, the bosses are also huge. In some cases, they can take up nearly half of the screen! Ranging from giant space stations to huge space monsters, to floating Easter Heads (?), the graphics are great. Not to mention some of the better backgrounds.

The story seems to be nonexistent. It's pretty typical otherwise. You, a small little space ship, must save the world from destruction and face impossible odds. You know how it goes. But then again, this is a space shooter. How many do we know of that actually tries to incorporate a story anyway?

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: Use Power Up
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Warp Ahead
Destroy the boss of the level within five seconds to warp to the level two levels! For example, this would take you from level 1 to level 3.
Super Ship
Pause during a game and enter the Konami code (UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A START) and you will have all equipment. Only works once per game.

Secret Message
Hold B + A while turning the power on or resetting to get the following message:

KONAMI ONE

Whitebeard the wizard has lost his powerful magic scrolls. He asks his good friend Waldo to search the Realms of Enchantment to find them. Well, you know our favorite world traveler just can't resist a call to adventure, so it's off to the magic lands!

Now it's your turn to help Waldo in his thrilling quest across areas filled with giants, castles, dragons, crazy monks, monsters and much more! Find alarm clocks that give you a little extra time, Bonus Points that add to your score, and even Waldo's canine buddy who will take you on a magic carpet ride! All the fun and wild cartoons are here for Waldo lovers everywhere!

Gameplay:

In each stage the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. The game has three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and expert. The difference between the difficulties is the time given for each level (and "expert" has no clock refills to give you extra time).

The pictures are slightly animated images of Waldo scenes, the player has to scroll along the long picture to survey the scape while searching for Waldo and other objects. The directional buttons control a magnifying glass and is used in order to "find" objects. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each level and by finding him the player gets to play a small bonus game to collect points while controlling Woof on a flying carpet.

This golf game comes with pre-designed golf courses in locales such as the U.S.A., Japan, England, Scotland, Germany, Spain, France, Australia, and Hawaii. There is also an opportunity for the player to design their own golf course. The game features variable weather conditions like showers, downpours, wind, and sunshine. The game allows for both strokeplay and matchplay. It also allows for three difficulty levels: novice, amateur, and professional. Practice mode lets the player train on the putting green or on a practice hole.

Gameplay consists of aiming the golf ball and then swinging the chosen golf club. Swinging is done by a meter which measures the power of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices. Putting is done with an overhead view on the green with the meter being used to measure the amount of power that is put on a putt.

Long ago, in a distant galaxy, an alien race sent a huge world - called Naju - hurtling toward Earth, loaded with a cargo of mysterious life forms.

During the long journey, these creatures have multiplied and become increasingly evil - and now Naju teems with evil. However, deep within this complex globe are self-destruct mechanisms that can be activated to destroy it before it reaches Earth.

Now, you must battle your way deep within Naju's labyrinths to destroy the alien world. You are the guardian of Earth and your saga will become The Guardian Legend

The Labryinth: The external maze on the surface of Naju consists of passages and rooms.

The Dungeon: Inside Naju, there are mysterious corridors created by the huge, evil life forms.

--From the NES Guardian Legend instruction manual.

Overview:

Once upon a time there was a space station called Naju. Naju was invaded by a hostile alien race a sent reeling towards earth. During the trip to earth the hostiles have multiplied and converted the Najus to their evil ways. Now, the space station is nearing earth and it is up to you to infiltrate it and find the self-destruct mechanisms inside. You play a robot capable of transforming into a fighter jet. The world expects you to live up to the name, "Guardian Legend."

The graphics in this game were very well rendered, and the sound wasn't bad either. This was a highly underrated game. I'm sure you've never heard of it, so when you get a chance, check it out.

Directions:

I really liked how this game mixed an overhead shooter with an adventure game. I didn't play it too long, but I liked what I saw. It seems as though you will spend a lot of your time in the labyrinths of the space station. It doesn't take long to blast your way through the flying scenes. The inside of the space station is where you have to a lot of exploring and problem solving. It's got something for everyone.

A tropical island (specified as Cuba in the Japanese original) is being oppressed by a dictator, but fortunately one or two brave US soldiers (Ernesto "Che" Guevara in the Japanese version) are on hand to restore justice. March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style.

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.

Ex-FBI Agent turned detective, Mr. Stevenson, receives a ransom Note. His only daughter, Jennifer, has been kidnapped. Armed with only a Zapper and a keen eye, you must help him collect the five Black Panther Diamonds, hidden all around the world, to gain the release of Jennifer.

--From the NES Gumshoe instruction manual.

Overview:

STEVENSON,

I'VE GOT YOU'RE DAUGHTER.
BRING THE 5 "BLACK PANTHER"
DIAMONDS TO ME WITHIN 24
HOURS OR ELSE! COME ALONE.

P.S. DON'T CALL ME...
I'LL CALL YOU
KING DOM
--story from the game intro to Gumshoe

Directions:

Gumshoe's controls are quite simple. Shoot the Gumshoe to make him jump. Shoot him repeatedly and he can fly through the air.

Shoot enemies and dangerous objects to destroy them. Sometimes items pop out of destroyed enemies. If you grab a potion you'll become Pink and be able to take one hit without dieing.

Shootable objects flash a white border whenever you fire.

You must collect all the diamonds, or you won't be able to enter the last level. 

Controls:

Just point and shoot!

Hints:

Continue
When the game over screen appears, fire a shot. You will be able to restart the game at the last phase (ala Super Mario Bros. continue code)

The most happening place in the universe is the trendy, upscale solar system of IOTA Synthetica, part of the Galactic Federation of artificial stars. It's as far from dirty old Earth as can be... But don't sign up to go yet!

A strange cosmic energy field with a major attitude has engulfed the system, and the most outrageous things are happening. Ordinary inanimate objects are coming to life - harmless little animals are becoming rabid giants - and the freaked-out residents are under attack! The only Galactic Commander who can handle this ordeal is the eccentric renegade called Gun-Nac.

He can oust this aura that's threatening the destruction of comfortable artificial life as we know it. But where in the universe is he? He could be as far away as Earth, searching for a new Game Pak. Commander Gun-Nac, if you read this, call H.Q., A.S.A.P., O.K.? We N.E.E.D. you!

Gameplay:

You assume the role of commander Gun-Nac. You fight a host of enemies from your space ship, in which you battle your way through 8 separate levels. The ship can be upgraded to a larger ship by acquiring a "wing" for your plane, which allows the player to sustain two enemy hits rather than one, and allows the player to upgrade his weapons farther than his standard ship would allow.

The game contains 5 primary weapons, as well as 4 types of secondary bombs. The primary weapons range from a standard gun to a flamethrower, to a type of guided boomerang, have unlimited ammunition, and are obtained by collecting circles with numbers that correspond to one of the 5 different weapons. The secondary bombs work on a similar principle. They are obtained by collecting similar circles with corresponding letters within them. The bombs however, are limited in supply to however many you can collect. In addition, the primary weapons can be upgraded by collecting multiple "Power P's" that float through the stage.

Both the weapons and bombs can be progressively upgraded throughout the game. When a player has acquired a particular type of weapon, say for instance a type 1, then the player can upgrade his weapon level by collecting more than one of the same circle in a row. Each time another matching circle is collected, the weapon is upgraded, up to five times.

The players bombs can also be upgraded using the same method, but by upgrading the bombs, another element is added to the game. When a bomb is upgraded, the bomb becomes twice as powerful, but also consumes twice as much ammunition. This forces the player to chose not only the appropriate weapon, but whether or not he would like to upgrade the weapons power, collect or avoid weapon upgrades, or collect more bombs regardless of their type.

The upgrades can be purchased in the shop in between levels with money collected throughout the levels, can be found randomly floating through the level, or can released by destroying objects or enemies during game play.

Direct from the arcade, this vertical scrolling shoot-em-up stars a heroic cowboy who comes to save the town of Hicksville from the Wingate Gang.

Directions:

Definitely one of my favorites from the olden days, you just get to run around the screen shooting the heck out of everything in sight! Thank goodness for the machine gun, automatic fire sure saves wear on the thumb.

Kill lots of bad guys for money. Shoot barrels to get power-ups.

You can buy cool weapons from certain helpful citizens, then use the inventory screen to equip them (you'll need to pick up some ammo first). The shotgun shoots a wide spread of destruction and can hold 120 shots. The machine gun lays down a continuous stream of hot lead while you hold down the button and can carry 400 rounds. The Magnum fires huge explosive rounds, but can only hold 100. The Smart Bomb wipes out all your enemies if you get hit, but you can only carry one at a time. Be careful, if you get killed with a special weapon equipped, you lose it.

You can buy ammo, wanted posters, and horses from another friendly type. Wanted posters allow you to meet the boss, otherwise each level will scroll through indefinitely. Horses keep you alive, they take three hits before they are shot out from under you. Other power-up items include boots which help you move faster and rifles which improve the range of your guns (you can have four of each), blue pinwheels to give you a short time of invulnerability, red pinwheels which give you an extra life, and POW which kills all enemies onscreen except bosses. 

Controls:

A Button: Shoot Right
B Button: Shoot Left
A and B: Shoot Straight Ahead
Start Button: Start/Pause Game
Select Button: Inventory Screen

Hints:

Machine Gun Cheat
To start with a machine gun and 300 ammo, at the title screen press A, A, A, A, Select, Select, Select, Select, Right, Right, Start.

Gyrodine is basic vertical shooter based on Taito's arcade game with the same name. You pilot a helicopter and have to shoot as many enemies you can. You will fight against enemy helicopters, bunkers, tanks and fighter jets above different terrains like water, desserts and military camps. There is no background story and there are no levels.

Professor Hector and his assistant, Professor Vector, navigate side-scrolling platform levels with the help of their creation, R.O.B. Their lives are threatened by dynamite and hungry little lizards called Smicks, and Professor Hector's sleep-walking tendencies get him in trouble as well.

Gameplay:

As the Professor character moves through the levels, R.O.B. must aid navigation by raising and lowering red and blue gates. When a Gyro depresses the red pedestal, red gates are lowered. When a gyro depresses the blue pedestal, blue gates are lowered. The action on the screen never stops, so, while operating R.O.B., the on-screen character continues to be vulnerable.

Game Modes:
 
Game A (1 or 2 players)

In this mode, the player controls both R.O.B. and a Professor character, switching on the fly. Professor Hector (Player 1) and Professor Vector (Player 2) must collect all of the bundles of dynamite in each of 40 successive levels. When the player presses start: the screen turns blue, the Professor looks outward from the screen toward R.O.B., and the next button pressed issues one command to R.O.B.every command to R.O.B. must be preceded by a press of the Start button. Wandering Smicks are a threat, but are harmless when eating the turnips found throughout the phases, which the professor may pick up and move at will. A Smick crushed in a gate is worth 500 points. Bundles of dynamite are worth 100 points. Seconds left on the clock after each level are worth 100 points. Five extra lives are supplied.

Game B (1 player)

In this mode, Professor Hector is sleepwalking, and the player controls only R.O.B. Commands need not be preceded by the Start button, as R.O.B. is controlled directly. The Professor starts at the left edge of the screen, and walks slowly toward the right side of the screen. If he hits a gate, he'll just continue to walk straight into it until it moves out of his way. The player must use R.O.B. to move the gates, allowing the Professor to reach the right side of the screen. Smicks are present in this mode, but they mostly confine themselves to dead ends. There are 25 phases in this mode. Three extra lives are supplied.

Test 

Serves only to confirm that the R.O.B. can receive signals via the television. Pressing select sends a signal that should cause his red LED to light up.

Direct 

In this mode, no game is played: commands are simply sent directly to R.O.B. First-time players or players who just want to operate R.O.B. without playing Gyromite can use this mode to deliver R.O.B.'s commands. Pressing up or down on the directional pad causes the arms to move up and down. Left and right make the arms swivel counter-clockwise and clockwise. The A button opens the big penal arms, and the B button closes them.

The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.

    <desc>I found a whole treasure trove of cool China pirate games including names like Final Fantasy VII, Chrono Trigger, Harvest Moon, Diablo and a Zelda game among about 50 others that I couldn't make the names out!

Man was I excited to try them out.

But then....

iNES Mapper 163 struck down my hopes of ever seeing these played on XPORT's Madmab Edition on the Box!!!!!!!! 

One game did work though....

The Hacker!

Title screen is pretty awesome.  It looks like you're going to play Neo from The Matrix. (Why does he have a pony tail though?)

The game pretty much blows and doesn't respond well to your controls, but put the controller down for a minute and there are some impressive animations your character does while waiting for you to move.

All in all.... skip it.


NOTE:  If you do decide to give this one a try it may take a few times getting it loading.  Sometimes it just kicks you back out to the menu.

In the peaceful town of Carpentersville, some workers known as The Rusty Nailers decide to bulldoze a house that belongs to Harry. Harry is certainly not happy with this, and goes on a rampage, destroying workers that get in his way. As Harry, you can destroy workers in one of two ways: you can smash them when one of them gets near them, or you can pound the ground, and by doing this, you will send shockwaves in both directions.

There are four environments in which Harry needs to get through: construction sites, sewer, ship, and the mansion where Harry meets the leader who ordered the demolition of his house. At the end of each environment, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next environment. In between these, there are bonus stages in which you have to destroy a number of enemies before time runs out.

    <name>Happily Ever After starring Snow White</name>

    <image/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
At the turn of the 1990s an all new animated film based on the Snow White fairytale was set to hit the cinemas alongside its very own video game tie in. Happily Ever After, as it was known, unfortunately hit all kinds of issues in production, which in turn had a knock on effect with its Nintendo NES outing. Eventually hitting the theatres in 1993, the movie was a complete flop and understandably its video game debut was somewhat lost to time - until now.

Given the film's later arrival it's safe to assume that the publishers behind this upcoming tie-in were reluctant to risk releasing a game on the quickly aging Nintendo NES with new hardware just around the corner. In the end Happily Ever After was retold as a Super Nintendo game and released exclusively in North America the following year. This 16-bit platformer, however, was not created by the original Japanese team behind the Nintendo NES version, SOFEL.

Although being featured in several magazines such as Nintendo Power in the run up to the movie's release, the original Happily Ever After video game remained unreleased and unheard of for many gamers even today. Luckily for us though, the video game preservation blog NintendoPlayer recently posted an all new article on the game after having received a generous donation of the game's ROM from a reader known as Sean McGee.

While you'd expect a game based on a children's movie to be an educational affair, Happily Ever After on the Nintendo NES is a surprisingly challenging platformer for all ages. Featuring somewhat Castlevania styled combat, nicely detailed environments and your stereotypical 8-bit soundtrack, you'd be wrong to write off this unreleased title too quickly.

Offering a full and exclusive write up on both the Happily Ever After NES prototype and the troubles surrounding the film, NintendoPlayer have made a ROM of the cancelled game available for all to download. Capable of running on flash cartridges such as the Everdrive N8 and RetroUSB PowerPak (and of course emulators too) those interested in sampling this lost tale can finally do so.

Those international superstars of basketball, the Harlem Globetrotters, are here! Now you can play with 1, 2, or 3 friends, or against computer-selected opponents, and perform the antics made famous over the past 65 years by the irrepressible Clown Princes of Basketball.

Choose to play as a Harlem Globetrotter or face off against them. In either case, you'll combine awesome basketball skills with high hilarity. It's unpredictable! It's unequaled! It's an action-packed entertainment treat for "kids" of all ages!

Hints:

Special Pass: Pressing Select with a direction button will create a behind the back pass which is quicker than the normal pass. It seems to get interecpted by the computer more often though.

Slam Dunk: When on a clean break if you are running and you press B to take a shot, and you happen to be at the correct distance from the net, your player will make a slam dunk that sends the crowd in cheers.

Piggy Back Slam: Unknown at the moment. I'm trying to figure this out. If you have any info please email me and I'll put it in a FAQ update.

Pull Down the Referee's Pants: During a jump ball if you press B or A at the correct time right before he throws up the ball, your player will pull down the referee's pants, and get the ball automatically.

Trip the Referee: When a free throw has been called, the players will run down to the key area, and the ref will run by, a well timed B button will send him to the floor.

Ball on Elastic: Happens only when your taking a free throw. Unknown to me at the moment. See Piggy back slam.

Remember Tetris? The way those cubes kept coming at you? That was tricky enough, but what if they were half a dozen different hats instead? Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time.

All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don't, you'll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!

The impossible and unthinkable has happened. Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site. It's up to you to infiltrate the installation and eliminate the leader of the terrorist army. It won't be easy. Powerful tanks, treacherous waterways and the bridges are all part of enemy territory now.

The only weapon you'll be able to defeat the terrorists with is HEAVY BARRELL - but it's been dismantled and is in pieces inside the installation itself. Once you've battled your way inside, you must find the keys and reassemble the weapon. Brute force alone won't defeat the terrorists. This isn't a job for just anyone. That's why you are here!

Hints:

Continue Game
Select a 2-Player game, and when you begin playing, let the 2nd player die. Continue playing with Player 1 and when Player 1 loses his last life, play the game with controller #2!

Don't let the first mountain fool you, its slopes are rather similar and uninspired, but keep in mind this is the beginners' hill. The other mountains are vastly different with slopes containing half-pipes, huge gaps, cliffs, lakes, chateaus and even highways.

Learning how to pass each obstacle will keep you busy for quite a while. The variety of levels is one of this game's shining aspects. My only complaint here is that you must do specific tricks in a certain order on the half-pipes or you lose a life.

Hints:

Begin with 99 Lives
Hold Left, A, B and press Start on the title screen.
Level Select
Hold Left, A, B and press Start on the title screen, then press Right + A when you see the mountain on the screen

    <desc>People say that this is a lot like Mappy, but I've never played Mappy. But Mappy can't be as elite as Hello Kitty. Well anyway, your job is to water all the pots in the level until a happy lil fruit sprouts. Then you go to the next level. I know, it sounds terribly complicated. But the charm of all Sanrio games lies in their complexity. All kidding aside, not only can you water plants (press Down) but you can smack all the enemies that try to stop you (press B). They're only stunned though, which makes things tricky! In any case, the game kicks ass. Whether the Sanrio part adds to it or causes it, it kicks ass. It's a nice simple game to play when you're bored, and you end up playing for hours. So Play It.

Translation Description:

All that needed doing here was the title screen and some miscellaneous graphics. Needless to say, it didn't take long, Um, let's just leave it at that.

    <desc>Hello Kitty World defies explanation, as evidenced by my trying to fit this in a category. Is it action? Adventure? Platform? You don't know, do you? Admit it! The gameplay's hard to explain; you can tell from the pics that it doesn't try to be badass, but it still is. The premise is simple enough; you just float around. Really. That's it. You can even try and get the balloons if you want. It's a good idea too, since it makes the game more interesting. But you don't have to. It even has BOSSES, and you can jump on their heads and stuff. There's not much else to say about the game.. Just that everyone needs to go play! Okay that's all.

Translation Description:

A ton of people worked on this game. InVerse did most of the hacking stuff I think, and basically all of the distribution stuff. See, InVerse wasn't always bad!

    <desc>This is supposedly based on some kind of anime show in Japan. I've never seen it before, but you're sure I'm going to now, after seeing all the oddball characters in this game. As you can see, it's a nice little shooter game. Well it's not great, but it's decent enough. It's really slow though, so don't expect to get totally overwhelmed like in R-Type or something, like that's a bad thing. You're lucky if you see two enemies on the screen at the same time! But still, it's a neat game. My roommate and I both agree that the Professor is its saving grace. He is just too damned cool!

Translation Description:

This new patch version 1.01 by Dragoon-X translates a lot more stuff, giving this a true 100% completion mark. There's still some weird color changes in the text sometimes, though they were there in the original rom. Why didn't the programmers mess with that? Oh well.

    <desc>David Bowie once sang "you've gotta have a scheme/you've gotta have plan/for the world of today/for tomorrow's man". But David Bowie has said a lot of strange things, so let's not mix him up in this review.

Hirake Ponkikki features a variety of annoying games, which if thought out well could have turned out fun like Mario Party. Instead, it's just a variety of annoying games for the lowest common denominator rehashed again and again, and it smacks of developers stuck with a licence and no good idea to go with it. When you start the game, you find yourself on a map with a set of levels. The first level is an annoying forced-scrolling platformer, in which you pick up easily-accessible fruits and dodge animals that walk threateningly at you at a medium pace. It's a good game to play if you've suffered a terrible hand accident and want something unchallenging to play while you recover.

The next game, your guy's little friend hides in one of many cups and shifts the cups around. You have to guess which cup your guy's little friend is in. The only case in which someone could lose at this game is if they have the attention span of a doughnut, or if they were too busy writing a snotty review to watch the cups.

After that is a familiar rock-paper-scissors game, which is probably fun for avid fans of rock-paper-scissors whose friends are all sick of being bugged to play it. Gape in awe as the game scores your ability to sit through a game of chance. Amazingly, you don't actually have to press any buttons for this one. Presumably this is a measure for players who aren't quite confident in their ability to play videogames. I got a better score sitting in front of the screen drinking Coke than I did trying to play the game.

Everybody wins at Hirake Ponkikki.

I started Hirake Ponkikki in the knowledge it was a kid's game, but when I played the next mini-game, I lost all hope for the slightest pang of entertainment or challenge. If kids old enough to be playing NES are in any way challenged by a game where you have to match up shapes, then it's a miracle they managed to figure out how to hold the control pad and press buttons.

I have no desire to describe the following game, because it's even stupider than the last game and I'm running low on bile and vitriol.

Once you clear the gauntlet of stupid, you can stop by a rather underwhelmed-looking mountain and enjoy a picnic cutscene, which really makes all the time you've wasted on the game worth it.

Then you can cross the bridge, and there's a fresh gauntlet of rehashed stupid waiting for you on the other side. If by this point you feel bored and don't really want to put in the effort  that's okay. You can clear stages with 0 points, and your little guy will still be so pleased that he "won".

Translation Description:

Oh boy, a complete translation. The translation does feel a bit odd in places, be it intentional mispellings for space (Moutain?) or the use of the word "Notice" instead of "Score" or something on the score screen, but chances are by that point in the game you'll be too busy rolling on the floor clutching your head and weeping to notice.

    <desc>One of the unique things about emulation is that it sometimes allows you to play not only games that are very rare, but also games that were never released at all. When a game is close to completion, prototypes are sent to the console licenser (and more recently, the ESRB) to review for any possible problems that would render the game in an unreleasable state. Sometimes these prototypes are of games that never actually saw the light of day for one reason or another.

Once in a great while, one of these prototypes is discovered in someone's attic or some other musty place, and it gets sold on eBay to a collector. Some of these collectors refuse to dump the prototype ROM onto disk because it would damage the cartridge, while others either don't have a problem with it or take money in exchange for dumping rights. One of the games that went through this long and winding path is the NES port of Hit the Ice.

    <desc>
Test your skills, using the Zapper, in Hogan's Alley. There are three quick- draw games to choose from: First, practice making split second identification of the gangsters in a line-up. Next, move into the streets where enemy targets can pop up from anywhere, then show 'em your stuff in the Trick Shoot, a rapid fire round for only the toughest G-men.

--From the NES Hogan's Alley instruction manual.

Overview:

Shoot the bad guys. Don't shoot the good guys. Yah.

There's not much story to this game. You're some sort of G-Man, meaning a federal agent of some description. Your task is to prove that you're the best shooting G-Man in the G-Squad.

Directions:

There are three modes of play in Hogan's Alley. The first is like a simple carnie game. Three targets at a time come out, one or two are gangsters and the others are innocents. Within the time limit for each round, you must take out the criminals.

You get points for each bad guy you hit, and you get charged with a miss for each innocent you hit and for each baddie you fail to get before time runs out. Ten misses and it's Game Over, otherwise you could go on forever.

The second game is the old classic cop training course, the 'alley' of Hogan's Alley. The same targets appear, but now they come from doors, windows, behind fences, etc. Which begs the question, why do we train cops to draw and fire against a criminal who pops up already aiming a gun at them? Anyway, same rules for hits and misses, but there may be more than three targets on screen at once, and they aren't all lined up nice and neat for you.

The third game is 'Trickshooting' in which your job is to shoot cans instead of bad guys. The can flies upward when you hit it, and your goal is to coax it into the slots at the left, without letting it fall to the ground. The points for each slot are shown, but you also get 100 points for landing on the small platform near the floor. It looks like this would be harder to do and thus worth more, I don't know what they were thinking.

Controls:

You can use your mouse as a Zapper for this game, as long as you are not in full-screen mode.
Select Button: Choose game mode
Start Button: Start Game

Hints:

Keep Firing
You don't get charged with a miss for shots you take that don't hit anything, so if you miss the bad guy keep shooting until time runs out.

Originality in video games is a rare occurrence indeed.

For the most part, games tend to add upon an existing idea; meat around the bone as we often hear. In fact, many great ''classics'' are little more than improved versions of already existing games. Why, one could argue that video games have not significantly evolved all that much in the last 20 years or so (as far as the basic logic of the game goes)...

There are times when a game truly breaks new grounds by putting forth a new paradigm - a proverbial epistemological rupture in the world of gaming.

Sadly, the Fist of the North Star series falls quite far from that tree...

Given the notorious reputation of the first installment, the very idea of reviewing it's sequel might make me seem like a masochist. Rest assured, Toei made significant improvements over their, shall we say, mediocre previous offering so that this game (although not the best side scrolling action game of all time by a longshot) is a much less taxing experience. In fact, it is a very MANLY experience indeed !

Let us be clear and structured then and explore...

The never-existing story

Obviously this game will give you no clue as to your motivation (other than being amused at the idea of making heads explode) for even pursuing this apparently desperate journey. Besides the name of the stage boss, you're given little information on everything and anything.

Now, understand that fans of the FotNS anime and manga (bless their little hearts) often find more enjoyment in the over the top violence than in the slightly confusing yet completely silly story. Still, having some idea of what you're doing would be nice...

The manual, however, does insert a small blurb to explain everything. Apparently, you're out to ''free your people'' from the clutches of some evil tyrant named Shula, Emperor Heaven. So you embark upon a journey into this Empire and reduce an army of clones into quivering masses of intestines, facing one dangerous boss after another before meeting the fabled Emperor Heaven.

A fan of the series informed me that the manual (and possibly the game itself) managed to make quite a few mistakes with the story. Seems the last boss you face is NOT Emperor Heaven, no matter what the game and its manual say. There are other cases, but I'm not going to delve into this controversy. Know that I'm as shocked as you are faithful reader - someone should warn Toei right this minute ! Fools they be, how dare they deprive us of the glorious (and exact) details of this MANLY story ? I feel an urge to use some...

This is the first in the series.  The US "Fist of the North Star" is actually a sequel to this game.

It's time to go Hollywood! Hollywood Squares, that is! It's tic-tac-toe with a twist - get your X's and O's by figuring out whether a "star" is giving a correct answer or making one up. And keep in mind that they don't always tell the truth! Consider the question, then agree or disagree with our electronic celebrities and the big bucks will be yours if you're right.

Test your knowledge and intuition. Is the "star" in the center square giving you a straight answer? Is that ridiculous response really right? Only you can decide. Competition is keen and excitement runs high when you play the fast-moving Nintendo version of this hit television game show. It's fun for everyone!

    <desc>This is an action/adventure sidescroller. Indeed a classic style, and the NES was pretty hot on sidescrollers, and this game proves that!

You're some long-haired guy stiffed into a white suit who can fire blasts of holy power from your hands! Isn't that cool? It would be cooler if your holy blasts had unlimited range, by the way.

Well, you can use some magic too. It costs you ( of course ) some MP to use them. You start with only a ''Double Fire'' kind of spell; it fires two blasts of holy power at once, and these can cross the whole screen. You get more magic from beating the bosses at the end of each level, whose effects range from a very useful ''Blizzard'' spell, that not only freezes up enemies but also turns lava into ice, to a ferocious ''Thunder spell that kills everything on the screen!

There are also nifty magic like a power bracelet which lets you break some blocks with your holy blasts, magical boots which makes you jump higher and a cape which allows you to spend half MPs on your spells.

You can also turn into a dragon in some areas in the later levels!

The levels are somewhat short, but nicely done overall. There's a whole bunch of ORIGINAL enemies - thank goodness there are no palette-swapped enemies in the whole game! Great point.

My only complaint on the gameplay is that the game is one player ONLY.

STORY

Ahh! I dunno the story of this game. There's NO introduction screen, and I bought the game without a manual - even if I had the manual, it would be in Japanese so I wouldn't understand a thing - and there seems to be NOTHING on the net about this game so...

GRAPHICS

The visuals on this game are good, although they could be a lot better. Some backgrounds may look a little bland - they could've been more colorful. And your dragon form could be a whole lot better. But most areas look just fine. The enemies and bosses look good, and so do you in your white outfit.

SOUNDS

I really liked them music from this game, and I'm sure you'll too. Awesome tunes will accompany you through the whole game, and boy do they fit the game... I really loved the boss music you'll just have to play the game to see what I'm talking about!

And the sound effects are also awesome, very crisp and clean.

Gym rats, beware! HOOPS takes you out to the asphault, where basketball is a half-court game of fast hands, faster moves and slam-jam-thank-you-Sam dunks! The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer.

You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!

After you're done thinking, you'll probably think it sounds a lot like Hotman. Basically, I just described the whole thing, and there's not much else to say. You just go around getting keys, so you can advance to the next stage. Sounds simple? Of course not! All in all it's a pretty fun game, worth a try at least once, even though I can't get past the second level. I really really suck.

Translation Description:

I don't think much needed to be translated here. On another note, isn't the new title screen sweet? InVerse did some seriously great work here. Hurray.

Eddie Hawkins, a.k.a. The Hudson Hawk, has the reputation of being the best cat burglar in the world, but he's decided to go straight.

Unfortunately, Darwin and Minerva Mayflower have other plans. They are rebuilding Leonardo da Vinci's Alchemy Project, a machine that can make gold! Good for them but disastrous for the world's economy. They need Hawk's help, and they'll hurt his best friend unless he gives it to them.

The Mayflowers order Hawk to steal two priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci. One is located in Rutherford's the heavily guarded auction house. The other rests in the vaults of the Vatican! Quite a challenge...even for the Hawk!

We need you to help the Hawk first, to save his friend, and second, because if Hawk can find where the gold machine is, maybe he can steal its key component and save the entire world from financial ruin...!

Jeannie Jungle has been captured by aliens! She's stranded somewhere on one of eight islands and you, as the somewhat heroic Master Higgins, must find her. But be careful - each island is guarded by an enormous creature that's very hungry!

Fortunately, you have a little help. There are five kinds of friendly dinosaurs waiting to give you a lift. They're stuck in eggs that you'll need to crack open!

Hidden eggs are scattered all over the islands. By finding and breaking them open, you might get a bonus, or even a secret way to the next island! Just don't eat the eggplant...

So hop on one of your dinosaur pals, and ride your way to Jeannie's rescue!

--From the NES Adventure Island 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Adventure Island 3 is much like Adventure Island 2 in the realms of graphics and gameplay. They are almost identical, the only real difference is the looks. The only real reason to play this game is to say that you have played the whole series.

Directions:

From the word go keep moving. You will lose life no mater what, so be sure to eat as much food as you can to ensure you will beat Adventure Island 3.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Fire/Use Weapon
Start Button: Pause Game
D-Pad: Move

Well, that Evil Witch Doctor refuses to give up! Princess Leilani may be safe, but her sister, Tina, has just been nabbed.

And this time you've got real trouble. Because not one, but EIGHT perilous islands stand between you and your honey. Get set to battle dinosaurs, survive avalanches and out fight the Evil Doctor's nastiest ghouls.

It'll be tough, that's for sure. So just remember sweet Tina, and how grateful she'll be when you come to her rescue!

--From the NES Adventure Island 2 instruction manual.

Overview:
The saga continues in Adventure Island 2. This game is not that much different from the first in the way of game play and graphics. Now the levels and extras in this game are far superior to the first Adventure Island. New cooler weapons, more levels, bonus stages, warp zones, and secret rooms are what you will find in this very cool game. Good luck, and have fun playing Adventure Island 2.

Directions:

Traditional side-scrolling action! Grab items such as fruit, milk, meat, and fairies! If you grab an eggplant, it will drain your energy, so stay away from it. If using skateboards, your speed will increase! While you're riding it, it will turn into a dinosaur!

Controls:

A Button: Throw weapon
B Button: Jump
Start Button: Confirm selections, pause/unpause
Select Button: Select START or CONTINUE

Hints:

Level Select
Wait until Higgins is hit by the coconut on the title screen. Then Press Right, Left, Right, Left, A, B, A, B.

Continue game play

The Evil Witch Doctor has kidnapped Princess Leilani from Master Higgins and taken her to Adventure Island in the South Pacific. It is your mission to help Master Higgins and save Princess Leilani, but it's not going to be easy. On the island, there are forests, mountains, caves, many enemy characters, and traps waiting for you. Can Master Higgins save Princess Leilani from the Evil Witch Doctor?

--From the NES Adventure Island instruction manual.

Overview:

Adventure Island is one of the first games that comes to mind when I think back to video games of my childhood. The graphics were not that great, but the color palette was well chosen. The sprites looked cartoony, but the backgrounds were nice. The gameplay is pure platformer enjoyment. The only variation is the part where you find a skateboard and ride it. Be careful though, because you can't stop, you can only slow down or speed up while riding it. The music is upbeat and pleasant, and the sounds are cute.

Adventure Island was the start of a great series, and this game was one of the hardest. I would say that anyone who has not played Adventure Island should give it a try, as well as its later installments.

Directions:

The moment the level starts MOVE IT! You constantly lose health, so you have to keep picking up fruit to restore your life. Of course, enemies are all over the place, so you have to watch your step. Find hidden eggs by jumping around in random spots, and sometimes they'll just appear.

Inside eggs are items that can help you, like the hatchet, fireballs, or a skateboard for faster movement. While on the skateboard, you can't stop, but you can slow down or speed up, and if you hit an enemy you'll just fall off the board rather than lose life. The hatchet is your weapon that you can throw at enemies. The fireballs are also thrown at your enemies, but they will go farther and cause more damage. Both the hatchet and the fireballs come with infinite ammo.

There is a vase you can find in each level that will double your bonus points awarded. Milk will refill your life bar. A ring will give you 2000 points. A baby Higgins doll will give you an extra life; these are rare and hard to find, so be sure to grab them up as soon as you see them. Honey Girl the fairy is trapped in some eggs, and when released will fly above your head for a short time making you invincible. The more enemies you kill by running into them while you are invincible, the more points you will get. Eggplant is Master Higgins' most hated food, if you open an egg with one inside, it will hover over you, draining your life till you have only two or three hits left, or you finish the stage.

A key will make a platform appear that you can catch, and it will take you to a bonus stage where each fruit is worth 500 points. A flower will double the point value of all food, except for the bonus stage fruit. A NES controller can only be obtained by killing a coyote from behind, and is worth 2000 points. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use weapon,Hold to run
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Infinite Continues
Before the end of the first level, you have to break a special egg. It's on the left edge of the piece of land the G sign is on, close to the platform. Jump around until it appears. Break it and grab the Hudson Bee inside. Now, whenever you die you can simply hold right and press Start to continue from the level where you died. 

Get to the world you like!
When you are at the main menu, you can put in a code that let you teleport to any other world (1-8).&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;ABAB Teleport to another world.

See the next boss ahead of time
When you defeat the first boss, pause the game as the first boss leaves the screen. You'll be able to see the next boss.

    <desc>I'm sure most people have played at least one game in the Hudson's Adventure Island series, what with its countless NES and Gameboy games. And because of this, most people will not play this game. Why? Well hell, Adventure Island sucks! You just walk forward the whole time! You jump over various things, and that's about it. Fortunately, this version of Adventure Island is actually good. In fact, it's really really good, which makes me wonder why it never was released here. Anyway, instead of merely going straight the whole time, facing nothing more serious than a rock or a slightly steep incline, Adventure Island 4 is laid out in a very non-linear fashion. You could call it a cutesy Metroid or Symphony of the Night, but I wouldn't recommend it. Oh, and the fruit? Those useless things that you did your damnedest to catch every single one of, although they did nothing more than raise your score slightly? They actually serve a purpose here! Yeah, it's cool!

For every eight fruits you get, you regain a heart's worth of health. It ain't much, but you don't get hit a whole lot so it all works out. Anyway, it's a great game that I order you all to play.

I really need to find a better way to end these things.

Translation Description:

Again, Demi does a great job translating this game, fortunately leaving out the "yaya" stuff that's been in some of his earlier work. And the title screen is super sweet, even though I took the pic in NESticle and the colors are all weird. Now go thank him right now for allowing you to play this gem! Right now goddammit!

The Soviet Union has created the ultimate first strike weapon. It is November 12, 1984, four months before Mikhail Gorbachev comes to power. The Soviets have built the RED OCTOBER, a Typhoon Class nuclear submarine which utilizes an experimental propulsion system. This new "caterpillar" drive renders the submarine virtually invisible to sonar. Fully loaded with nuclear missiles, the RED OCTOBER is an unprecedented war machine.

You are Captain Marko Ramius. Your superiors have ordered you to put the RED OCTOBER through its trial run of tests and naval exercises today. But you have other plans. You intend to defect and to lead the submarine and its crew to the safety of a U.S. port.

The Soviets will not allow this superior technology to fall into the hands of the Americans. Once the Kremlin realizes your plan to escape, they will send the entire Red Fleet to track down and destroy the RED OCTOBER. You must evade or destroy all enemies and navigate a course to the U.S. shore.

When Hydlide was released for the Famicom, it was actually given the name Hydlide Special to denote certain enhancements that this version contained over the original. Magic was only introduced to the series in Hydlide 2, but was retrofitted for use in the Famicom version of the original Hydlide. As a result, it plays only a minor role in the game. Hydlide is rather small, and can easily be beaten in only a couple of hours if one knows exactly where to go.

However, players of more modern RPGs will find the experience less than enjoyable for a few reasons. The game's very short tune plays repeatedly without change to many players' annoyance. The combat system takes some getting used-to, and the player's defense rarely ever improves. And last, but not least, the task of leveling up can be quite repetitive, and requires a lot of patience. While Hydlide was celebrated as an evolution in the Role Playing Genre in Japan, it was simply seen as a poor imitator in America.

In the kingdom of Fairyland, three magic jewels were enshrined in the palace to maintain peace in the kingdom. One day, an evil man broke into the palace and stole one of the three magic jewels. Without the third jewel, the two remaining jewels lost their magic sparkle. The magic spell that sealed the power of Boralis, the most vicious demon in the kingdom, was broken. During the turmoil which followed, the last two jewels were stolen. Boralis cast a special magic on Princess Ann, turning her into three fairies, and hid her somewhere in the kingdom. He then let loose a horde of monsters across the land and became the ruler of the kingdom.

Finally, the young knight Jim stood up and took action to restore peace in the kingdom. He bravely made his way into the wilderness in full armour to fight the monsters...

--From the NES Hydlide instruction manual.

Overview:

Once there was a kingdom called Fairyland. In Fairyland, there were three magic jewels enshrined in the palace that were put there to keep peace in the kingdom. All was well until an evil man snuck into the palace and stole one of the jewels. When he did, the other two jewels lost their "magic sparkle." There was a demon (Boralis) trapped by the sparkle of the jewels, so he was released when the evil man took one. After that there was much turmoil, in which the last two jewels were stolen as well. Boralis took over the world by taking Princess Ann, turning her into three fairies, and hiding them somewhere in the kingdom. At this point, he let loose a horde of monsters across the land. After a while, the young knight Jim, stood up to him so he could restore peace to the land.

This game has gotten a bad rap throughout the years. I think it was good idea, despite its semi-corny storyline. It was probably one of the worst RPG's on NES, but that doesn't make it a horrible game. The graphics weren't that bad, although the sound did leave a lot to be desired. Hydlide tried to be an awesome game but in the end I think it just came out an O.K. game.

It's only you and an ice hammer as you make your way to the top of the mountain! If you can break through 8 levels of treacherous arctic ice, you'll reach the top of the mountain. But watch out - the Nitpicker, condors and Polar Bears don't want you up there. And they've got a bag of tricks that will block your rise to the top. There are 32 challenging peaks to scale - face them alone or with a friend.

--From the NES Ice Climber instruction manual.

Overview:

Two ice climbers, Nana and Popo have heard of magical vegetables on the mountain tops. So they went off in search of them, while fighting off Yetis, birds, and whatnot.

Directions:

Fight monsters and break blocks with mallets to get to the top, and collect vegetables to gain bonus points. Play with another person for a better playing experience.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use mallet
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Choose One or Two Players

Hints:

Ice hockey is hard hitting, fast-action competition. Each team tries to put the puck into its opponent's goal. A game consists of three periods, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins. When the score is tied at the end of the three periods, the game is decided with penalty shots. If the score is still tied following the penalty shots, the game goes into over- time without goalkeepers.

--From the NES Ice Hockey instruction manual.

Overview:

You can choose from 6 international teams: U.S.A., Sweden, Poland, Canada, Russia, and "TCH". The forms of players come in thin (fast), medium (average), and fat (slow). The object of this game is to get more goals than your opponent. The game will seem frustrating at times, but with practice, you'll get better! Change players on the game screen with A and B before the ref shows up!

Directions:

Play one of the greatest sports of all time, in this game of ice-skating, puck-hitting action! 

Controls:

A Button: Pass the puck
B Button: Shoot puck
Start Button: Pause/Unpause

Hints:

Non-Stop Puck and No goalies!
On the title screen, hold down the A and B buttons on controllers 1 and 2, then press start on controller 1, now you'll have a puck that never stops moving, and no goalies at the nets.

It is the end of the 20th century. A worldwide economic recession wreaks havoc with the nation and the planet. The impending threat of anarchy has given rise to a secret vice organization called 'Crime Ghost.' Dangerously poised to take over the world with its diabolic strategy, 'Crime Ghost' has infiltrated every country simultaneously. There is one President who has initiated a plan to wipe out the association, but now his home has been attacked and his daughter Elise abducted. A letter has arrived demanding that he resign his powerful position within a number of days, or else his beautiful Elise will be executed in a most unpleasant manner. The letter is signed 'Faust, the notorious mastermind of Crime Ghost. The president knows to whom he must turn. The President has summoned two men known as Paul and Vince, the incredible Ikari Warriors. Now, YOU become Paul and Vince. You must go to the enemy hideout, rescue the lovely Elise, fight Crime Ghost, and destroy them all.

To do this, you will use your undersea scuba tactics; your guerrilla fighting power with machine guns and grenades; and your own brute strength, together with your superior Martial Arts skills, performing kicks, round-house kicks, jump kicks, punches, and more. Ikari Warriors, save the world from chaos! Now!

--From the NES Ikari Warriors 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Save the president's daughter from the evil organization that has kidnapped her. Not much of a plot, but there it is. These games weren't about that, just an excuse to kill everything in sight.

Ikari Warriors 3 was not that bad of a game, unlike its predecessors. This edition had a good many improvements. The graphics were a great deal better. The backgrounds looked better and the characters were well drawn. Also, the controls were a little more responsive. Ikari Warriors 3 was probably the best Ikari Warriors of its time. If you like Ikari Warriors, you'll love this one! 

Directions:

One big improvement for the controls was the ability to jump. If you press A and B at the same time, you will perform a jump kick. This is very good for dodging enemy fire. The only thing I didn't like about the game was the fact that for most of the game you don't have any weapons. You only get weapons during a boss battle, and sometimes you can find them on the ground, but they are limited.

Controls:

A Button: Punch
B Button: Kick
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Menu

Hints:

Weapons
Be sure to use weapons wisely when you find them, for they are sparse.

When we last saw Paul and Vince, they had saved the Colonel and were about to head for home in a special plane given to them by the General.

But then, while in flight over the ocean, the sky suddenly blackens - the ocean begins to churn - and the plane goes spinning! A booming voice fills the cockpit: "Hear me, Warriors! Zang Zip, the War Dog, has enslaved the people of Earth. Only you can save us from his grip of evil!"

Caught in a time warp, hurled thousands of years into the future, Paul and Vince know they have no choice but to meet this impossible challenge head-on. After all, they are professionals... they are the Ikari Warriors!

Overview:

Like most Ikari Warriors titles, Ikari Warriors 2 was a pretty bad game. The graphics weren't very good, and the controls were unresponsive. There are some people that like these games, but I don't understand why. Ikari Warriors was pretty popular in the arcade, but it just wasn't ported very well to the Nintendo console. The Ikari Warriors series has done pretty well as a whole, I just didn't like the ones on the NES very much. If you are an Ikari Warriors fan, play Ikari Warriors 2, if not, then I wouldn't try this one. 

Directions:

Kill everything in sight to make it through the game.

Controls:

A Button: Grenade
B Button: Machine Gun
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Grenades
Use grenades all the time, they are free!

There was almost no story to this game. This is what the manual said:

Paul and Vince are warriors with secret orders to invade an enemy nation. Working together as a team, they must fight for survival against a relentless onslaught of enemies!

The only story I've come across that was worse was Bad Dudes. Besides the story, the game still sucked. I didn't like the game-play. You couldn't throw the grenades far enough and what's worse is that they didn't blow up big enough. You were better off just shooting your gun, it covered just as much ground. The coolest thing by far was getting in a tank. I think Ikari Warriors got better as their sequels came out, but this one was a bit of a flop.

Directions:

Invade and take over the enemy's territory, using your rifle and grenades. Be careful not to run out of ammo! 

There are various upgrades you can get for your rifle, but not for your grenades, unfortunately. This limits the usefulness of grenades, because you can shoot as far with your gun and the grenade doesn't cover a large area. Just use grenades for things you can't blow up with bullets.

The best part of this game is getting a tank, which you can find at various points in the game. Press A to climb in, then you can steer the tank around, aim the turret, and fire explosive rounds. Now, your tank ammo does have some good upgrades, improving both its range and blast radius. Just make sure you find plenty of gas cans, because for some bizarre reason, these tanks will explode when they run out of gas. 

Controls:

A Button: Throw grenade, enter tank
B Button: Shoot weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Choose 1 or 2 Players

Hints:

Level Select
Quickly press Up, Down, A(2), B, Left, Right, A, B, Up, A, Down, Right(2), Left, B, Up, Left, A, Right, B, Left, Right, A, Left, Up, A, Down, A, Right, Left, A, Start at the title screen. The phrase "Stage 1" will appear next to the airplane landing screen to confirm correct code entry. Press A or B to change the starting level.

Continue
After you lose all your lives, press A, B, B, A to continue the game.

On a fateful day in 20XX, the Earth's moon exploded into four large fragments and a multitude of meteors. Aliens from afar had succeeded in destroying the West's moon base. One after another, mankind's other minitary industrial space complexes were being lost. What mankind dreaded had come to pass. Scores of unidentified fighters were in the area. In addition. the moon's main computer, still intact after the explosion, had a stranged vegetation coiled around it. Their trademark evil exploits being a dead giveaway, invaders from the Boondoggle Galaxy had arrived to take over the Earth.

To counter these evil forces, leading scientists from all over the globe created the "OF-1" Fightership. Combat pilots depart the Earth to fend off the invaders and earn everlasting glory.

    <desc>God, I suck at this. I can't even beat the rollercoaster bit in stage 2 for chrissakes! But, um, yeah. This is sort of a Castlevania game, but it really isn't. It's a sidescroller featuring a cute midget version of Dracula as the main character. You go through levels throwing fireballs at stuff, and jumping over stuff, and, uh, stuff.

You can charge your shot by holding down the fire button (and the Kid gets this evil little grin on his face); this seems to be the only way I've found of getting Coins, which are needed to play the minigames. The only one I got to try was the "One Shot" game, which had a little Skeleton-T lookalike sticking out of a trash can, or something, but I didn't get to see what it was about because I didn't figure out the weapon-charging thing 'til I got to stage 2, and as I said earlier, I never made it past the rollercoaster. Doh. Also of note is that you can aim your fireball up by holding "up" on the gamepad. I didn't figure this out until about halfway through stage 1, and two of the three bats in the first hallway nearly killed me 'cuz I didn't know this. Doh, again &gt;_&lt;

I don't know what the plot behind this is, unfortunately, because there doesn't seem to be one in the stage-and-a-half that I played. Maybe something kicks in later, but as far as I can tell, the Kid got woken up and he's pissed at whatever woke him up, so he throws a temper tantrum and goes bonkers on anything that gets in his way. And falls off of rollercoasters. And gets thrown off of clouds by witches and buzzards. And dies a lot. Doh.

All in all, this is a pretty cool game, I just suck at it. FUN!

Also, please note that this game has some really nasty emulator issues, so refer to Kit's readme for the full story.

Translation Description:

Everything's done, whee! It's a pretty good translation, too, even if it does break the game in NNNesterJ :/ The Konami code works in version 1.03.

The morning sun heats the jagged peaks as you follow the forgotten road down to the valley floor. The bleached ruins of great columned temples and towering citadels rise from the grassy plain like the bones of some colossal beast. Surely this was the ancient city of Erinoch, destroyed by dragon's fire over 1000 years ago. Mordamir spoke often of this city...

Mordamir! Your teacher in the arts of wizardry. Surely he visited the fabled Labyrinth of Eternity buried beneath the ruins of Erinoch! Perhaps this is where you will once again come face to face with your long lost master...

--From the NES Immortal instruction manual.

Overview:

The Immortal is legendary for its profoundly-steep learning curve and practically-impossible difficulty. Indeed, some sections of the game seemingly required the player to die in order to progress.

There are also a number of 'one false move' style death traps, and it is even possible to die in the very first room of the game. It is also remembered for the copious amounts of violence it contains; there are over 30 death animations for the player character, involving a variety of traps and monsters.

Impossible Mission II is a direct sequel to Epyx's 1983 game Impossible Mission. The game follows directly from the same plot, with Elvin Atombender seeking revenge, and the player having to stop him. The overall game structure and basic gameplay is mostly similar, but there are a few differences and new features.

The game takes place in Elvin's fortress, which consists of nine towers. Each of the eight outer towers has a specific theme, such as computers, automobiles, furniture and so on. Each tower consists of several rooms connected by two verical corridors with elevators and two horizontal corridors leading to other towers. This time, the corridors leading between different towers are locked, and can only be unlocked by figuring out a numerical puzzle. The map and all of it's rooms are randomly generated every time the game is played.

As in the movie (and the more-famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary.

This makes for a five-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps for the second. The third comprises a combination of the Venetian catacombs and Castle Brunwald in Austria. The fourth level takes place upon a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders. The final stage requires Indy to recover the Grail itself, before his father succumbs to heart trauma, following a gunshot wound.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an action game released in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. After the 1984 film release, Atari Games released an arcade version of the movie in 1985. Nintendo of America sought to capitalize on both the success of its Nintendo Entertainment System and the Indiana Jones franchise by porting the game to its popular console, along with Atari's other arcade games like Road Runner and Klax, as well as third-party games like Ms. Pac-Man and Rolling Thunder. The resulting game differed somewhat from the arcade version, but kept the same underlying premise and style.

By December 1988, there were two versions of the game available, distributed by Tengen and Mindscape, although the software itself was identical. After a lawsuit, Tengen's unlicensed version was pulled from the shelves and Mindscape's became the standard. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom gives the player control of Indiana Jones as he makes his way through the temple in a series of twelve levels or "waves." In the final wave, the player must defeat the villain of the film, Mola Ram, on a rope bridge that recreates the final scene in the movie. The game was almost universally panned by both contemporary and modern critics and game players, chastised for its poor graphics and the overall difficulty of gameplay.

In this game the player controls protagonist Indiana Jones going through levels taken directly from the film, albeit with a shorten and simplified plot. The game begins in 1938 with Indy receiving a package from Venice, Italy that turns out to be his father's Grail Diary. At the same time he receives a telegram from Marcus Brody telling him the Cross of Coronado is on a ship off the Portuguese coast. The player is then presented with the choice of recovering the Cross of Coronado or going to Venice.

When the player goes to recover the Cross, they are on a ship and must defeat a certain number of Panama Hat's goons before fighting the boss himself. By recovering the cross Indy will receive a telegraph from Sallah who knows the location of the Holy Grail. Afterwards the player can head to Venice where they are presented with a sliding puzzle challenge. The player must complete the puzzle before the fire, traveling through the tunnel, engulfs the room. By solving the puzzle in time Indy receives a sketch showing the true holy grail. Another telegraph arrives from Sallah telling that Henry Jones, Sr. was taken captive by the Nazis is being held at Brunwald Castle and Marcus Brody has gone missing.

Saving Marcus takes place on top of a German tank in Iskenderun where Indy has to kill Nazis and Colonel Vogel before the tank plunges over a cliff. If the player fails, the Nazis steal the diary and Indy must travel to Berlin to recover it via a motorcycle riding sequence. At Brunwald Castle the player must navigate a convoluted maze to find Henry Jones Sr, although if caught they again must travel to Berlin to recover the diary.

At the Final level of the game, the player finds themselves at the Lost Temple. They must careful navigate the floor to spell out the word "Jehovah". If they stand on the same tile for too long it falls or if they take too long the torch goes out. Afterwards they reach the final sanctum containing the Knight and several grails. If the player has the sketch from Venice it will aid in identifying the correct grail. Choosing the correct Grail will show the ending.

The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.

The player takes on the role of a master-of-all-trades hero, who was apparently modeled on the pop hero Buckaroo Banzai. The player's objective is to fly a helicopter, land at enemy bases, and infiltrate compounds to stop the mad leader. The inflitration portion of the game bears a striking resemblance to Epyx's 1984 Impossible Mission.

HOWZAT!!? Your teammates let out a loud cry of appeal to the umpire. It seems like an eternity before he raises his arm to indicate the batsman is out. Out LBW for a duck! Your fast bowlers have been deadly accurate. Let's hope your batsmen can perform as well when it's your team's turn to bat. Warning! This is not a spectator sport. International Cricket puts you in total control of bowling, batting and fielding skills. Choose your team from the international line-up, select the best players for the day and may the best team win. International Cricket is a multi-player game that allows you to choose to play a single match or series of matches. Practice in the nets or go straight into the game. Whether you are batting or fielding, your skills will make the difference between winning and losing.

The Date: June 5, 1944. The United Forces are preparing for their final assault on the Normandy Coast. The Mission: Establish a beachhead, break through the front lines, and infiltrate and destroy enemy headquarters.

To spearhead the invasion, they have chosen Paul, from Command Unit 88 - a secret unit known as "Iron Snake." An experienced combat veteran with special forces training. Paul has been called a Man of Iron.

But to succeed in his mission, Paul will need the full firepower of the United Forces' mightiest fighting juggernaut: the Iron Tank!

The game is shown entirely from an overhead perspective, as in traditional top-down shooters. The player must collect weapon upgrades and operate various machines to combat the alien enemies. Various obstacles, such as pitfalls and land mines, must be avoided. There was a boss battle at the end of each level, and sometimes mid-level as well. The player's progress in the game could be saved using a password system. Between levels, images and text were sometimes displayed which showed Maverick's thoughts or reminiscence about his life.

Story:

The story takes place on a planet outside of Earth's galaxy called "Pan", which is suddenly attacked by a mysterious alien force. The aliens have the unique power to consume any living thing, as well as machines and buildings. Pan soon becomes overtaken by the alien force and the army of Pan begins losing all of its military power. The soldiers and people of Pan are told to evacuate the planet, however, a captain of the army, Max Maverick , refuses to leave. He instead suits for battle and faces the aliens alone, using a motorcycle and Hover-craft as his means of transportation. Max must stop the alien menace or face the destruction of his world.

Trivia:

A pirate version of the game called "Contra 8" exists. It has an altered title screen with a black-haired Bill Ryzer and a bit altered player sprite, so that it looks like a woman.

In the game, up to 3 players (4 in the NES version through use of either the NES Satellite or NES Four Score) compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. Good results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro boosters.

The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to 0. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' Sprint series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in most arcade-style racing games today.

Return to 'Nam

Infrared satellites soaring miles above Earth have spotted dozens of American prisoners of war still trapped on enemy soil.

Missing for years but never forgotten, these men must be brought home.

But America is in no position to risk an all-out invasion that could prompt retaliation. Instead, the only possible hope for their freedom is a small scale commando raid - code name JACKAL.

Immediately the President turns to the Green Berets and their combat-ready, tactical infiltrating "Jeep Squad". The Jeep Squad is comprised of twenty all- terrain, four-wheel drive, super-mobile attack jeeps, each equipped with one driver and one gunner. Only forty of the Green Berets' bravest and most cunning soldiers belong to this elite fighting force, and because of the secrecy of the mission, only a few of them qualify for the rescue attempt.

Needless to say, you've been chosen to be one of the few, the proud, the Jackals.

So work up your courage and polish up your guns, because it's time to save the life of each and every brave American POW.

And before you go, your country would just like to say, "Good luck, son. Don't come home alone."

--From the NES Jackal instruction manual.

Overview:

Driving your Jeep with machine guns blazing, rescue POW's from the enemy and destroy his fortress of evil. "You'll need a pocket full of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild Jackal!"

I have to say this is probably one of the best games for the NES platform, technically speaking. The graphics were truly excellent for the time, and the music and sound effects are great too.

Directions:

Jackal is one of the first games I can remember where your enemes have to actually attack you to hurt you. So your jeep can run over puny mortals that get in your way as long as they don't shoot you first.

You can ram enemy vehicles as well, but that's more of a kamikaze thing because it kills both of you. The attack system is very interesting: you have a machine gun that always fires forward and a grenade gun which always fires the direction your jeep is facing. This gives you some flexibility in your attack options and is great when there are many enemies on screen. Another interesting detail: you actually have to physically rescue the POWs in-game, it's not just some plot point. They are being held in various tents and barracks, which you have to blow up with a grenade to let them out. When you free them, you have to drive up to them and they all pile into your jeep. There are green POWs that just give you points, and there are flashing POWs or Officers who upgrade your weapon from Grenade to Missile and then increase the explosive damage of your Missiles. If your jeep is destroyed some of the POWs will survive and you can pick them up again, but Officers never make it, so you're back to Grenades. 

You have to actually carry the hostages to the end of the level to get full credit for rescuing them, but I think you get some points for picking them up the first time.

Jackal is a relatively short game for its genre, but it makes up for it in challenge and pure fun. There are a wide variety of enemies and bosses, different terrain and various obstacles to overcome. Don't worry, it won't seem short, and when you do finally defeat the final boss, Jackal loops back to Level 1, so the pursuit of fun and incredible High Scores never ends! 

Controls:

A Button:Fire Grenade or Missile
B Button: Fire Machine Gun
Start Button: Start/Pause Game
Select Button: Choose 1 or 2 Players

Hints:

2-Player Life Steal
In a two-player game, if one player runs out of lives while the other player still has extra lives left, the dead player can steal a life from his partner by pressing A and B simultaneously.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
The player controls Jackie Chan, the famous martial arts stuntmaster, and brawls against many nameless goons during his quest to rescue his sister. There are five levels in the game, each with a boss at the end.

Along the way, Jackie can encounter frogs carrying power-ups or bowls that restore health, which he can obtain by hitting the frog. These power-ups can allow him to do a special type of attack a certain number of times. Only one power-up may be carried. Jackie can also charge a special beam-like attack on his elbow by holding the B button and releasing it. This attack may be done five times. Most enemies Jackie defeats will drop green orbs. Collecting 30 of these orbs will replenish his life and his 5 charged shots.

If the player dies, all orbs and power-ups are lost and must be gained again. The player only has 1 life in the game, but may continue up to five times initially. Extra continues may be earned through the bonus stages.

Bonus Stages:

Occasionally, a bell may appear in certain areas of the levels, which will take Jackie to a bonus stage. The bell appears when the player stands at a certain place on a platform. These stages involve doing some task such as jumping on clouds or hitting fish dropping from a waterfall. The better Jackie does, the more points he earns and the better his rewards.

You'll run into a couple of bosses, too. Once in a while, you get bonus rounds, which you drop bombs on the jellyfish in the water by a jet.

Controls:

A Button: Shoot weapon
B Button: Shoot weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause

Hints:

Jellyfish
Jellyfish attack from the bottom of the screen, attacking a jellyfish once will kill him, resulting in 50 points.

It's been 41 years since Jeopardy first showed its face on the millions of television screens, from the army base to the autistic research center, to the gym to the home at night. It's been a great show, but the 3rd Jeopardy game made for the NES really doesn't have an impact.

First-off, the first Jeopardy game for the NES used the engine this one uses, so it's not much of a change of scenery. The only thing that really changed, was that the podiums were more of a teal-like color, the questions and answers were different, and the opening animation was different as well, just like in the Wheel of Fortune Family Edition. If this game had been made with the Super Jeopardy engine, it might have looked much better.

In my personal opinion, this game was certainly not worth buying unless you didn't have the original NES Jeopardy, or you did but you knew every answer and question the minute you saw it. But then, if you wanted the full NES collection, this would have to be there. But if you want to try it, go ahead, it's right here.

Directions:

Play the best game of Jeopardy possible, by asking questions to the answers given. 

Controls:

Control pad Up: Ring In
A Button: Pick categories and letters
B Button: Pick letters and categories
Start Button: Exit menu and start game

Hints:

To Challenge Yourself
Computers too hard for you? You can turn them off when the option that says "Play against computer" comes up. Just move it to "N" and you're good to go.

Welcome to Jeopardy. Junior edition.

Jeopardy Junior is played the same way as normal Jeopardy, but the clues are very easy to work out. It's perfect for kids who are 8 years old and up, because they know so much of this stuff already. The categories have obvious names, so that kids won't be messed up trying to figure out what the category is about. For example, there might be a category about food. In normal Jeopardy, the category might be called "Let's Eat". In Junior, the category is "Food". It's a simple system and it works quite well. 

Directions:

The object of Jeopardy is to give the question to an answer. Really simple. Anyone who's seen Jeopardy will know how the game is played.

Controls:

Control pad "Up": Ring In
A Button: Choose letter or number
B Button: Choose letter or number
Start Button: Exit start menu and enter game
Select Button: Nothing 

Hints:

Easy way to get points/money
First you'll need the internet (that's obvious, because you need the internet to use Console Classix) while you find an answer you don't know, go to a search engine and look up information on the answer you are on. It might take a while, but you can rack up lots of money doing it.

It was the famous game-show that shocked the world when it made its return in 1984 - What is Jeopardy? Correct!

Jeopardy is a game-show based on not answering a question, but rather questioning an answer. Your mind will be tested, your brain will be challenged, and you will be in Jeopardy!

Directions:

The object of Jeopardy is to question answers on a board with 6 categories with clues that range from $100-$500 in the first round, then $200-$1000 in the second round. It's not as easy as it sounds.

The scoring is dead simple.

If you can get a correct response, you win the dollar amount selected and get to choose the next answer. However, if you don't get a correct response, you lose your money, but it doesn't necessarily mean you lose your turn. If one of your opponents can place a correct response, they win the money and choice of the next answer.

There are 3 Daily Doubles throughout the game: one in the first round (Jeopardy), two in the second round (Double Jeopardy). If you are in control of the board and get a Daily Double, you get to wager an amount not to exceed the total you have. If you're below Zero (We've all been there) you can wager a maximum of 500 in the first round, 1000 in the second. If you get a correct response, you win the money. If you don't, you lose the amount you wagered.

In Final Jeopardy, the round after Double Jeopardy, contestants are given a category and they must wager an amount not exceeding the total they have and whoever has the most money at the end wins. 

Controls:

Control pad Up: Ring In
A Button: Pick letters and numbers
B Button: Pick letters and numbers
Start Button: Start game after main menu

Hints:

Winning the Final Jeopardy round
There's a simple strategy called "Doing the math." Firsthand, you need a calculator. Next, (now this is just an example) if you've got 7000, and your nearest opponent has 3000, use the calculator, to times their score by 2, which will be 6000, in this case. Then, minus 6000 from 7000. You'll have 1000. Now, minus one from 1000. You'll have 999. Now wager that and win the game, because there's no way for him to win, even if you get the answer wrong and he gets it right.

LINE-OF-SCRIMMAGE REALISM THAT PUTS YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME!

John Elway's QUARTERBACK is the home video game you've been waiting for. So real you can see the game like a quarterback does, from the line of scrimmage. You call the plays, you throw the passes, run the ball, and make the tackles.

It's third down and a long four yards to the first down that will stop the clock. No time-outs left. The weak side linebacker is lined up inside his defensive end. They're coming! You check-off the play at the line of scrimmage and call for a quick pass to the tight end. He breaks it for a T.D. !

Named for the quarterback who twice won the AFC Player of the Year Award, this is the game made for every kid or grownup kid who ever wanted to play the game as well as John Elway.

"I hope you enjoy playing my QUARTERBACK game as much as I do." -John Elway

The time is the year 0373 in the new space age calendar. The earth's population is exploding so rapidly that people are seeking exodus to an outer space paradise. People everywhere are eager to develop space colonies and emigrate to them.

Jay McCray is no exception. He is preparing for his journey to the new space colony #428 in the Silius Solar System. He decided to move to the colony because his father, an astute scientist, was instrumental in the space colony development. Jay had always been proud of his father and wanted to be like him, even more so now, becuase his father was appointed leader of the SSS colony development.

Jay's dream is to be on a space colony development team. Unfortunately, his dream will not come true. A devastating explosion rocked the SSS colony and destroyed everything, including all project data and the research team. Any further development of the colony would be impossible.

Because Jay's father was killed in the explosion, Jay would never know what really happened. He is determined to take over for his father, but without his father's records, research is at a standstill.

While searching his father's room, Jay finds a floppy disk. When he puts it in the computer, he realizes, it contains a complete plan of the SSS colony development. The disk also includes a letter from his father which reads, "Terrorists are plotting to destroy the colony development. If anything happens to me, you must complete the project."

"Father knew this would hapen," Jay said to himself, "but, now that I have his plans, I can finish his work." As Jay worked on the project, he realized the terrorists were still out there and even more determined to destroy the SSS colony plan.

Jay then vows, "I have no choice but to fight the terrorists to defend the colony development and to avenge my father's death."

    <desc>Joust More is a hack of the old NES game Balloon Fight. This ROM hack takes place in the distant future when supplies of fossil fuels have been rendered extinct and people need balloons to travel from place to place. When Grimlick first played the game, it surprised him how similar the gameplay was to Joust. It was a pretty simple process to switch the graphics to the ones that are in the NES Joust game using the Tile Layer program.

The gameplay is the same as Joust, the player press the button to flap his wings and he has to be above the enemy to destroy him. And as in Joust, dont get too close to the lava pit or the Troll of the Lava Pits will grab the player. The parts of the game that are different are the ability to get hit twice by an enemy before dying. Also, after being hit by the player, the enemy buzzards try to protect the eggs as they float down to the surface. The player must hit the buzzard again to get it to drop the egg into the lava. When the egg hits the lava, it will get enveloped in a lava bubble and float up to the sky where the player can grab it and get extra points.

The player controls a knight armed with a lance, mounted on either an ostrich (player 1) or a stork (player 2), who battles waves of computer-controlled enemy knights mounted on giant buzzards. These knights have three different speed and agility levels. The game screen is static; its only features are five platforms hanging in mid-air (some wrapping around the screen), the ground, and a pit of lava beneath.

The simplicity of its controls are a factor in the game's wide appeal. A joystick moves left and right, and a "Flap" button flaps the mount's wings once. Pressing "Flap" in rapid succession will produce a gain in altitude until simulated gravity drags the mount downward.

Gameplay:

Each wave begins with enemy knights appearing on the screen at one of four "spawn points". The three types of knights, from weakest to toughest, are: Bounder (red, 500 points), Hunter (white, 750 points), and Shadow Lord (blue, 1,000 points). To destroy a knight and collect its point value, the player must collide with the knight while the player's lance is vertically higher than the knight's. If the player's lance is vertically lower, he or she loses a life and is awarded 50 points.

After destroying a knight, an egg will fall to the ground. The player must touch the egg to destroy it before the egg hatches to produce another, more powerful knight. This hatchling is harmless and may also be destroyed by touch prior to the knight mounting a new buzzard. The award for destroying eggs and hatchlings progresses with each one collected, from 250 to 1,000 points in 250-point increments. This progression starts anew upon the death of the player or the beginning of another wave. Players are further rewarded with 500 bobegins with enemy knights appearing on the screen at one of four "spawn points". 

A wave is cleared when the player destroys all enemy knights and eggs. Survival Waves reward a player who avoids death during the round with 3,000 bonus points. If too much time has elapsed during a wave, a pterodactyl will appear from one side of the screen and fly around until it either collides and kills the player, the player clears the wave, or the player destroys it by hitting the pterodactyl directly in the mouth with his lance, earning 1,000 points.

Two players can play Joust simultaneously, and each player earns points for destroying enemy knights as well as his human opponent (2,000 points). Cooperative play is possible by agreement, but accidental kills through collision remain possible. Completion of Team Waves award 3,000 bonus points each to players who successfully avoid killing one another. Gladiator Waves encourage players to kill each other by similarly offering 3,000 bonus points to the first player to do so.

During the first two waves flooring at the bottom of the screen covers a lava pit, which is uncovered on the third wave as the floor burns away. On the fourth and subsequent waves, a troll inhabits the lava pit; if any player or enemy knight flies too close to the lava, the troll's hand will emerge and tug the mount down toward the lava. Players can escape the troll's grip by repeatedly pressing the "Flap" button.

As waves progress, some platforms disappear, to be rejuvenated for "Egg Waves".

Every fifth wave is an "Egg Wave," which begins with a full screen of platforms (any that have disappeared are redrawn) already populated with eggs. These eggs hatch after a period of time, although it is possible for a player to destroy all eggs before any have hatched.

Programming bugs:

One flaw in the program's design, later touted by producers as a "hidden feature", gives players a strategic advantage. Two platforms are situated on the right side of the screen so that one slightly overhangs the other. If a player flies his or her mount so that its belly skims the lower platform such that its legs do not extend, the bird will then "belly flop" across the platform and illogically "squeeze" through the point where the two platforms meet, shooting out below the upper platform. Skilled players took advantage of this flaw to suddenly appear and land by surprise on an enemy knight or competing player. Game creator John Newcomer stated in interviews that this design flaw was so popular it was intentionally retained as a permanent feature of the game.

Early ROM revisions of the [arcade version of the] game presented a situation which a player could periodically exploit to accumulate an indefinite number of points with low risk. The player could maneuver an enemy knight too close to the lava, such that the lava troll would grip it, but not low enough that the troll would succeed in pulling it in, and not high enough that the enemy knight could escape. By doing so, the knight could not attack the player and the wave would never end. The player could then stand in the middle of the central platform to safely face oncoming pterodactyls, striking them in the mouth merely by standing still. Pterodactyls would appear at an increasing rate from different sides of the screen to be killed repeatedly, scoring large amounts of points toward extra lives. Arcade operators were not too pleased to see players exploit this bug.

    <desc>For some reason, I had always thought TMNT Tournament Fighters was the only one-on-one fighting game for the Nes (unless you count the tournament mode of Karate Kid). BUT I THOUGHT WRONG. Not only is there another fighter for the Nes, but unlike TMNT Tournament Fighters, this one doesn't suck. Proof that Joy Mech Fighter doesn't suck? Well, for starters, after playing TMNT TF for five minutes, I thought that little gray cartridge would make an excellent substitute for a clay pidgeon. I had no such sentiments after playing Joy Mech Fighter.

Anyway, I imagine you've played a fighting game before, so I'll spare you the details of what the gameplay is like, because its like every single other fighter. What sets it apart is the concept of the game. You start with one robot fighter, and as you play through the game, each robot you beat becomes a new playable character. It's like Megaman meets Street Fighter. And the graphics totally kick ass for an nes game. You've gotta check this one out, it's bound to keep you entertained for awhile.

Umm, the translation is complete, and looks really cool! Oh, and the title screen rocks! Yeah!

The player controls Mowgli, a feral young boy who has been raised by wolves. Mowgli must leave his home in the jungle and go back to the human village because Shere Khan, a tiger, is now hunting him. Mowgli must fight jungle wildlife and ultimately Shere Khan himself to reach his village. During the journey he meets Bagheera, Baloo, King Louie, the hypnotist snake Kaa, as well as Shere Khan.

Gameplay:

The player controls a young Mowgli through various side-scrolling levels in a similar mold of Pitfall. The Mowgli character must shoot or avoid enemies and negotiate platformed levels and enemies by running, jumping, climbing vines and using the various weapons and powerups available during the game. Mowgli starts the game with a banana projectile, but may collect invincibility masks, coconuts, double banana shots , and boomerang bananas during the game.

Levels are completed by collecting a sufficient number of gems, then finding a specific character placed in the level. The player scores points by obtaining gems along with having fruits and other items that contribute to the player's in-game score.

Levels:

This information is drawn from the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version. While the NES/SNES titles differ in stage layout, the story arc is identical. Stages are divided into chapters which, sequentially, comprise the plot. Each chapter opens with a description of the story at that point and the objective of the stage; some stages are completed by defeating a boss, while others have 'friendly' characters which the player is required to find after collecting sufficient gems.

The player has seven minutes to complete each level. Depending on difficulty, the number of gems the player must collect to progress is either eight (easy), ten (medium), or twelve (hard), of a total of fifteen gems spread throughout the level.

Music:

The soundtrack features tunes from the Disney cartoon that it is based on, including the popular "Bare Necessities."

Trivia:

This was one of the last third party games released for the NES.

    <desc>Just Breed is unlike any strategy RPG I've played, which, considering the amount of strategy RPGs I've played, is not really saying that much! You know in most strategy RPGs you're dumped into a predetermined setting, and there's a bunch of monsters around, and you're given a goal of some kind (like DEFEAT THE MONSTERS! or PROTECT THE PRINCESS!), and when you win you're all yay, and you go on to the next predetermined setting.

See, though, in Just Breed you can run around towns and talk to people and stuff. It's JUST LIKE A REGULAR RPG! Amazing! But! When you go outside and into the overworld, it goes into a strategy RPG setting, where you move a set number of squares, and attack enemies in a straight line from you, and such. Once the enemies are all defeated, you can run around on the world map to your little heart's content. Very nifty.

Your group is divided up by generals, and each general has people that follow him or her. One of the things I really like about Just Breed is that experience is distributed evenly throughout each group, and not individually like usual. Yay, no more of that constant character-juggling so no one ends up weaker than the rest! This is a huge deal to me.

So, as far as the very short list of strategy RPGs that Spinner 8 enjoys, Just Breed can be easily added to the above list, omigosh what a weird sentence.

Translation Description:

If you downloaded an earlier patch from somewhere else, be sure to get the new one that fixes a menu crash later in the game.

So this translation is awesome. Bongo's hacking work is second to none, and Shih Tzu's script is a joy to behold. If you have a problem with this translation, then you are a prick and no one likes you.

Players adopt the persona of Colonel Scott O'Connor, a military agent who has transferred his brain into raw binary code in order to combat a rogue program in the Main Defense Computer. When Colonel Scott O'Connor enters the system, his body forms the self-image of his ancestors which were Kabuki actors.

Gameplay:

The field is generally side-scrolling, with a single room with a boss at the end of each level.

Players use their long hair and chip based weaponry to attack enemies inside the computer.

Upon beating the game, a sound test menu is active with a two-frame animation of Scott under his Kabuki guise, bowing. He also states a message to watch for him in his next game, which never came to be.

Plot:

In the far future, a virus has appeared in the Main Defense Computer of the planet Earth. The origin and nature of the virus is unknown. Scott O'Connor volunteers to undergo an experimental transfer technology that converts his brain into raw binary code. He takes on the image of a Kabuki dancer, since the computer recognizes his grandfather as one. The virus in the virtual world takes on properties of an actual virus-it leaves behind debris, mutant creatures, and parastite enivironments of a biological nature. At the final level, it is revealed that the virus is of alien origin, having been picked up by a lost Hyperion probe launched to a neighboring planet. O'Conner stops it before the virus can order the Hyperion to fire its laser weapons and destroy the human population.

Trivia:

This game has gained a peculiar currency in popular culture, with oblique references in the TV show Lost, as well as the film Garden State.

In the background of the first person shooter, Soldier of Fortune, a character is briefly seen playing the game.

Similarly, the hairstyle sported by the main playable character enjoyed a small amount of popularity in fashionable districts of Tokyo during the early nineties.

    <desc>Kanshakudama Nage Kantarou no Toukaido Gojusan Tsugi (try saying THAT three times fast) is the story of Kantaro, a guy with a ton of bombs, who's taking a trip across the Toukaido, the road between Edo and Kyoto. He wants to see his love, Momoko, but is she waiting for her?

For some reason, he finds himself assaulted by ninjas, swordsmen with baskets on their heads, and guys with guns (yeah, what the hell?) so he has to use his very own bombs to defeat them. Some are easy, but others require certain tactics which are difficult to perform, especially because of the way that Kantaro attacks. (It's not fun.)

This is a very fun platformer despite all its shortcomings (which aren't really shortcomings but more of the result of the genre still being perfected), and it can entertain you a lot if you can get past the troublesome control.

Translation Description:

The translation's pretty well done, especially considering the small amount of space that KingMike had to work with. Basically the messages between levels and other system messages were translated, as were some graphics in the game that indicate scoring and progress. It must've been a pain in the butt having to do all that with an 8-8 square, lemme tell you that.

    <name>Karate Champ</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Karate Champ is a 1984 arcade game developed by Technos Japan Corporation for Data East. It is one of the first fighting games and has been believed to be the first to use today's common side-perspective. However, Heavyweight Champ, released in Japan by Sega, used the same perspective and predates Karate Champ by eight years.

Overview:

The player assumes the role of a Karate competitor and fights against another player or the computer. Using two joysticks, players can execute a number of moves.

Gameplay consists of a two dimensional fight between Karate characters wearing white and red gi, followed by various bonus rounds for the successful player. This pattern repeats itself in the next, more challenging round set against a new background. Unlike most later fighter-type games, there are no health bar or hit points. A hit successfully landed ends the round and earns the player or his opponent either one point or half point (along with a numeric score for the top ten but this has no effect on winning a match per se). The first to two points is the winner. The game also featured some early speech synthesis, in which the judge would call out such phrases as "Fight!" or "Winner!" It's also spoken in japanese in the Japanese version.

Player vs. Player Edition:

Karate Champ led to the creation of a direct sequel titled Karate Champ  Player vs Player which was also released in 1984. It was released in Japan as Taisen Karate Do: Bish?jo Seishun Hen, which roughly translates "Competitive Karate Road: Young Pretty Girl Edition"). Both versions are very similar in the sense that they use the same hardware, have the same sprites and title screen, and the gameplay is essentially the same although the computer AI is greatly improved along with control and hit detection. Whereas the original game started with the first level taking place at a dojo and all the following levels taking place at a tournament stadium, Player vs Player has the characters fighting it out over girls at locations around the world.

Ports and Release Information:

Karate Champ was ported to the Apple II, Commodore 64 and the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Apple II and Commodore 64 ports were both developed by Berkeley Softworks. The NES version was developed in-house by Data East in the United States and released in 1986. This port was later released in Japan for the Famicom Disk System on July 22, 1988, but never made it to the cartridge-based Famicom.

An emulation of the arcade version was released by Hamster for the PlayStation 2 as part of their Ore-tachi Gesen Zoku lineup.

The game is seen briefly in the movie Bloodsport starring Jean Claude Van Damme.

The evil Akuma has destroyed your homeland, killed many of your friends and kidnapped your Princess Mariko. Fortunately, you are skilled in Martial Arts, so your inevitable quest to reach Akuma's palace has a chance of success.

The game is viewed from the side and features a succession of increasingly-difficult opponents. All the standard karate kicks and punches are available to both you and your foes. The game's design was serious and realistic, and the game featured lots of cutscenes to develop the story.

Think you can handle a real Martial Arts challenge? Then how about guiding DANIEL SAN through the series of hazards, obstacles and challenges that stand in his path? But don't think that just being able to fight will get you through. This time its not enough to just punch, kick, and jump...this time your total Martial Arts training will be put to the test. Your discipline and inner control could be what saves your life. You must prove that you are capable of thinking, reasoning, and reacting. Catching a fly with your chopsticks, or splitting blocks of ice with your bare hand is just as important as fighting face to face with your enemy.

This challenge will take you to the Karate Tournament in L.A., the back roads of Okinawa and many strange areas beyond. Always keep your mind clear and remember all that you've been taught and maybe...just maybe. .. you'll make it.

--From the NES Karate Kid, The instruction manual.

Overview:

You are Daniel, a Teenage boy who decided to take up karate so you could defend yourself from the bullies that beat you up on the first day of school in a new town. You took your lessons from an old Japanese man named Mr. Miyagi, an expert in the field of karate. He's brought you to a tournament, where you must fight your way through. Once the tournament is done, you begin your adventure in Okinawa. Can you beat up all the bad guys and make your way to the end?

This game is best played with strategy, not cheapness. Try to figure out ways to combine your moves like a true karate kid. If you try to take your opponent down cheaply, he'll just use strategy to get you. It'll take time, but you'll come out swinging after long times of trying. The game has a pretty good arsenal of sounds, the music should be on a SNES (it's good, in other words) and you get your fix of NES martial arts action.

Directions:

You have 3 chances, an awesome karate outfit, a tight muscle shirt and sweatpants to start with. As you go along, you beat up other red suited guys for no apparent reason and pick up letters that bring your health up. You're playing along like in the movie, The Karate Kid and The Karate Kid Part II. And you've got lots to do. You can even train with that axe that Mr. Miyagi trains you with (it's in one of the screenshots) That's exactly what you should expect from this game. The accuracy it has to the movie. Most video games, even today, don't have accuracy to the films they're based on.

Karnov's full name is Jinborov Karnovski. He was originally based on a middle-ages legend, Karnov the Firespitter. According to the myth, Scottish villagers would call forth Karnov to chase gypsies from the area. The legend stated that Karnov would use his fire breath to burn gypsy wagons and eat their babies as food.

Karnov attracted an unusual amount of interest in Bulgaria during the Cold War, where it was one of the few games that the authorities allowed (presumably due to Karnov's Russian heritage). The popularity of Karnov took some rather bizarre turns in late 80's Bulgarian culture - at one point, a rotund Bulgarian even had a low budget cooking show entitled "Cooking With Karnov!" Karnov, although popularly illustrated as an Eastern European or a Slav, is actually from the Far East of the former Soviet Union as shown on the original arcade flyer and again in 'Karnov's Revenge'.

Karnov later became Data East's mascot, and was reintroduced in many other Data East games, including Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja in which he played a boss in the first level. Karnov later appeared in 1994 in another one of his own games for the Neo-Geo hardware called Karnov's Revenge. This game, also known as Fighter's History Dynamite, is not a sequel to the original Karnov, but to Fighter's History, a competitive one-on-one fighter in which Karnov was the final boss.

Gameplay:

The game puts the bulging muscled, fire-breathing, ex-circus strongman east-Russian hero on a quest through 9 different levels to search for treasures. However, between him and the treasures were several horrendous monsters, including sword wielding monks, jinn, foot hopping giant fish and ostrich-riding skeleton warriors.

Players can make Karnov walk, jump and shoot his way through these levels and find special items that will help him on his way. He also can collect red orbs with which he can upgrade up to 3 fireballs at a time. Each level contains a variety of strange enemies, such as gargoyles, rock creatures, and strong men, which Karnov must destroy or avoid. When he reaches the end of a level he usually has to face one or more powerful enemies which he must defeat to beat the level and receive a new piece of a treasure map. At the end of the game he must face a powerful boss often called "The Wizard" and collect the treasure.

Special Items:
 
In each level Karnov can collect a variety of items along the way, which can be chosen right away or only at certain times. 
The items Karnov can use at any time are:

Jump Boots - Allow Karnov to run faster and jump much higher temporarily. 
Bomb - Destroys enemies and some floors and walls which can lead to hidden areas. 
Ladder - Used to reach high places. 
Boomerang - Powerful throwing weapon that destroys most enemies in one hit and can be retrieved after being thrown. 
Super Fireball - 30 fireballs that destroy most enemies in one hit. 

The items that are activated in special zones of levels are:

Wings - Allow Karnov to fly for a limited amount of time. 
Scuba Helmet - Is used only in the fifth level (sea). Allows Karnov to swim faster in water. 
Mask - It will flash and a noise will sound where it can be used to receive a cache of hidden items. 
Trolley - Karnov can ride through and destroy ground enemies. 

Misc Items:

Red Orb - Increase the firepower of Karnov, letting him spit more than one fireball at a time, with a maximum of three. 
Letter K - Although not really a special item, if Karnov collects 50 of these, he will earn an extra life. 

Ports:

This game was later ported to numerous home consoles, such as the NES, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Tiger Electronics handheld and others.


Famicom/NES Version Differences:

Karnov was released for the Famicom on December 18, 1987 in Japan, and a year later on its North American equivalent, the NES, in 1988. Although it plays very similarly to the original arcade game there are some noticeable differences:

Karnov takes 2 hits to die instead of just one. After being hit once he will turn a blue color in which he has one hit left or can gain an extra hit back by grabbing a blue fireball orb. 

The Super Fireball is replaced with the Spike Bomb which destroys every enemy on screen. The Trolley item is replaced with the Shield which is used to reflect an enemies fireballs. 

Levels 4 and 8 are completely different from the arcade levels. 

The final boss is no longer the Wizard, but a giant three-headed dragon by the name of Ryu. Both fights, however, take place in similar rooms. 

Both the Famicom and NES versions are also slightly different from each other. The Famicom provides a story throughout the entire game, complete with images. The NES game does not have such a feature. The Famicom game is also considerably more difficult since it does not allow the player to continue after all lives are lost. The NES game, however, provides unlimited continues. The NES game also allowed Karnov to be killed when both the A and B buttons were pressed on the second controller.

Pop Culture:

Robby Roadsteamer wrote a song called "Kathy Sucks At Karnov" for his 2008 release "This Album Syncs Up To Toejam And Earl" 

In 2005 Galaxy454 Productions released the 30 minute film KARNOV based on the post-video game adventures of Jinborov Karnovski. Karnov the movie.

In a stranger vein, Karnov appeared as the protagonist of Something Awful's Dance Dance Revolution parody, Dance Dance Karnov. 

In March and June 2006, Karnov once again appeared as the subject of Something Awful updates. "The Karnov Playsets" (1 and 2) included short clips featuring Karnov in a variety of surreal and nonsensical settings.

He has also spawned a "Religion" with "services" being held at thechurchofkarnov.com.

    <desc>I remember enjoying the Kart Fighter rom on the net since I first saw it many years prior. The game itself is not too great, if you've played any of the Street Fighter clones on NES then you've played this game.

Something enjoyable about Kart Fighter is that the characters are from Super Mario Bros. If you've played Super Smash Bros. or Super Smash Bros. Melee, you would probably agree with me that Kart Fighter is a close cousin.

I always get a good chuckle our of the graphics. Parts of the game look "ripped" from Nintendo's Super Mario Kart game; other backgrounds look like they were swiped from Little Nemo: Dream Master. The characters themselves...absolutly weird. When Luigi fights, he looks like he is on drugs. Princess Peach is dressed in a short skirt, I guess she's showing off her sexy legs? Some of the other characters look quite humerous as well.

    <desc>Okay, here's a weird one. Kart Fighter is an unlicensed "pirate original" fighting game for the Famicom which features characters from Super Mario Kart beating the holy hell out of each other, Street Fighter style. Sound like Super Smash Bros? It shouldn't. This game predates Nintendo's own take on the genre by several years, and in fact could be cited as a source of inspiration for the creation of Smash Bros. Well, okay, maybe not. But still.

Anyway, Kart Fighter is...well, it's actually really good, surprisingly. Some would go as far to say that it's the best one-on-one fighting game on the NES, though its only serious competition is Joy Mech Fight, TMNT Tournament Fighters, and all that unplayable pirated crap like those "ports" of The King of Fighters, Mortal Kombat, and the dreaded Cony versions of Street Fighter.

Among its bootlegged peers, though, Kart Fighter reigns supreme. The game positively reeks of effort - all character sprites are original and unique to this game, and are large, colorful, and well-animated. The gameplay isn't perfect, but it's at least existent, which is more than you can say for any other pirated fighting game ever made for the NES. It's actually playable, for chrissake. PLAYABLE! Heavens!

It's not an excellent game by any means, but its mere concept and the decent amount of quirk contained within (dig the game's inexplicably capable and hot interpretation of Princess Peach) make Kart Fighter very much worth playing. If only for a few minutes.

And yes, the game has a two-player mode. Press left or right on controller 2 at the character select screen to enable it. Have a fun!

Description:

This isn't so much a translation as it is an "improvement" patch. The original game contained a whole bunch of weird (and possibly intentional) spelling errors in the character names, which apparently bugged DvD enough to make him want to fix things up. This patch fixes all the character names you see both during the game and on the high score table, and also makes a few small graphical changes, to further enhance your Kart Fighter experience.

Shame he couldn't do anything about the game's crippling flickering problem, though. Oh well, that's what FCE Ultra's "allow more than 8 sprites per scanline" option is for. You'll definitely want to enable that for this game, kids.

    <desc>This is one helluva a neat platform game. You (yes, YOU) are the great and mighty Kero Kero Keroppi. You see, one day, all the people of Donut Pond were playing the game, when from the monsters inside the game took over Donut Pond. How sad. So Keroppi alleviates everyone's fears and sets out to kick some monster ass.

The game is your standard-issue Nes platformer. You jump around from platform to platform, and kill various enemies by jumping on them in the time-honored platform tradition started by Super Mario Bros. You can also kill stuff by shooting at them. "With what," you ask? Why, with musical notes (and, if you get enough power ups, with Keroppi's very mighty name). The interesting thing with this game is that instead of confronting you with a boss that acts just like all the other enemies in the games (except the bosses take three jumps to kill instead of one), you are confronted with a boss that challenges you to one of a variety of mini-games.

On top of all that, the graphics are ruley. (BTW, if you like these games, check out the Wagyan Land games. Exactly the same thing, except instead of Keroppi, you control a Gon/Godzilla looking thing).

Translation Description:

Again, the translation is complete, and I have nothing to say here. Um, Sanrio is cool.

    <desc>Another Sanrio game. And believe it or not, it kicks ass! In this one, Keroppi's girlfriend Keroleen has been kidnapped (why?), and Keroppi goes off to save her. Sound familiar? Well, first you have to solve a bunch of puzzles before you can get there. Still sound familiar? Well it's not, dammit. You're not restricted to one type of puzzle either.. You have the odd lilypad jump-around-and-make-the-platforms-change-position game, and the platform game where they change color, and the underground staircase thing, and the extremely easy game where you just walk to the exit. It manages to stay interesting for quite a while, and is very fun to play. So, um, try it out.

The kingdom of Lowrel is attacked and burned by the evil witch Belzed's troops of monsters. In the attack, the king and the queen are slain, and their only child, princess Silphee is kidnapped. The king's guards were all killed, except for the powerful knight, Macren. He and his younger brother, Thonolan, an aspiring martial artist, take off on a long journey to defeat Belzed. They start their long struggle in the witches' forest outside the kingdom of Lowrel. As the fight against the evil forces of Belzed commences, Macren is slain by a skeleton soldier.

Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.

Let us go back to the distant past to an age when the Gods and Man lived together in harmony. There was once a kingdom called "Angel Land." This kingdom was ruled by two beautiful goddesses, Palutena who administered light and Medusa who ruled darkness.

Palutena lived in the Palace in the Sky and administered light so that man could live in happiness. And bathed in this light man grew food and lived in peace.

However, Medusa the goddess of darkness was different. Medusa hated mankind. She took great pleasure in drying up the crops that man took great pains to grow and in turning people into stone statues.

In her anger Palutena changed Medusa into an ugly monster and banished her to the deep, dark Underworld. For being changed into this ugly monster and forced to live in the Underworld, Medusa promised to take over the Palace in the Sky where Palutena lived. So great was Medusa's anger that she joined forces with the monsters and evil spirits of the Underworld and Medusa's army soon began to surpass Palutena's army in strength.

Soon a war between Palutena and Medusa began. Medusa led a surprise attack on Palutena's army which could barely fend off the attack. Palutena's army suffered major losses and was heavily defeated in the final battle. What's more, Medusa's army took the Three Sacred Treasures - the Mirror Shield, the Arrow of Light, and the Wings of Pegasus - away from them. Almost all of the warriors in Palutena's army were turned into stone statues and Palutena herself was imprisoned deep in the Palace in the Sky.

The peaceful realm of Angel Land came to be inhabited by foul and terrible monsters and was turned into a land of darkness ruled by the wicked Medusa. Locked in the depths of the Palace in the Sky, Palutena's strength was drained to its last.

As a last resort, she sought the help of the angel youth Pit who was being held prisoner locked in a deep dungeon in the Underworld. Pit was a valiant warrior who used to be in charge of Palutena's personal bodyguards.

Armed with a boy and arrow brought to him through Palutena's magical strength, Pit attempted an escape from the Underworld. The guard at this time was low in number as Medusa's army had advanced to the Palace in the Sky. Pit succeeded in his escape and set out on his long adventure to rescue Palutena. Yet to defeat Medusa he had to get the Three Sacred Treasures.

Will Pit be able to restore Palutena's light and return it to Angel Land? Only you can answer that question.

--From the NES Kid Icarus instruction manual.

Overview:

I thought this was one of the best stories Nintendo came up with on the NES. This platformer was a lot of fun to play. While I would classify this game as a platformer, it has a few RPG elements, like the ability to gain experience. You had to "buy" your strength upgrades rather than your character just growing though. I liked how you could go into one side of the screen and come out the other. I also liked how you could shoot straight up if you needed to. The music and sounds were enjoyable, but not great. I really like the graphics, though. They were well drawn. The monsters and your character were well rendered, although the backgrounds left a little to be desired sometimes. All in all, I think Kid Icarus was one of the best games Nintendo put out on the NES.

Directions:

Save your world from the evil Medusa by rescuing the goddess of light, Palutena. Fight your way through three levels with a boss at the end of each one, and a fourth level that contains the final boss.

Each of the first three levels are divided into four stages, while the fourth is just the boss fight. The bosses are: Twinbellows, Hewdraw, Pandora, and Medusa.

You gain levels by collecting experience points. You will gain a level at 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; and 200,000. The top level will be five. Each time you gain a level, you will gain hit points. There are also rooms where you can get better weapons and increased strength. The weapons are a shield, a sacred bow, and fire arrows.

Hearts are the currency in this game. A small heart is worth one, a half of a big heart is worth five, and a big heart is worth ten. A harp will turn all the enemies into mallets for a short time. Mallets are used to free centurions in the palace stages. They will help you fight the boss in that palace. A credit card will allow you to buy something and pay for it later. You buy the item, then your heart balance will stay at zero until you've collected enough to pay for the item. An angel's feather will allow you to fly instead of fall off a cliff. A glass of the water of life will return seven hit points instantly, while a bottle will restore the hit points when your life reaches zero. A barrel will allow you to carry up to eight bottles. Maps can be found in the fortresses and are visible on the pause screen. A torch can be bought in the fortress stores. It will show your position on the map. A pencil will show you which rooms you've already been to by turning them green.

Kid Klown in Night Mayor World (sometimes shortened to Kid Klown) is a platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in April, 1993. It was developed and published by Kemco. In Japan, it is known as Mickey Mouse III: Dream Balloon.

Kid Klown was originally a Mickey Mouse game in Japan. Released as part of the mostly Game Boy Mickey Mouse series, Mickey Mouse III: Dream Balloon was released in September 1992 by Kemco in Japan for the Famicom. Due to copyright issues, it was changed to Kid Klown in Night Mayor World for its US release.

Other games in the series include Kid Klown in Crazy Chase for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance, the Japan-exclusive Kid Klown in Crazy Chase 2: Love Love Hani Soudatsusen for PlayStation, and The Bombing Islands for the PlayStation.

Story:

Kid Klown and his family are on their way to perform in a circus when they meet the magician Night Mayor. He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Gameplay:

The player character, Kid Klown, carries balloons with which he can attack, jump higher, or float. There are seven (including the introduction level) different-themed levels throughout the game, and at every end of the level is a bonus stage where he can collect extra lives and extra energy.

The Kingdom of Voldam was probably the most peaceful and prosperous country on earth. At least it seemed so; but then the seeds of a single but worrisome problem began to spring up in the kingdom. Then one day, quite unexpectedly, King Voldam the Fifth failed to appear before the people of the kingdom. The people could not see their king because an incurable disease had fallen upon him and kept him confined to his bed.

There was only one way King Voldam could rid himself of this disease. He would have to collect the seven herbs of mysterious curative powers from a part of the neighboring but far-reaching Empire of Draxer. Moreover, it had to be done within three days.

To make matters worse, it was said that there were treacherous traps hidden throughout the area. Ferocious monsters, lying in wait for their victims, were everywhere. As the king's health worsened, the people of the kingdom grew anxious and dispirited.

It was at this time that a strange object from the skies made an abrupt landing. Had the Draxer Empire at long last launched an attack!!? In the midst of this confusion, an extraordinary boy from a far away country flew through the broad skies. The strange object, it seemed, was not of Draxerian origin. This boy, wearing what appeared to be dark glasses, was running and jumping from one place to another at fantastic speeds.

Word spread through the Kingdom of Voldam that the Grand Chamberlain, lord of all the king's vassals, had invited this "Kid Kool" to the palace. Once there, King Voldam and the Grand Chamberlain implored Kid Kool to set out for the evil Draxer Empire on their behalf !!

    <name>Kid Niki: Radical Ninja</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
One day in Feudal Japan, Kid Niki, the most radical of ninjas, is training at his Ninja School. Suddenly, a passing bird is stuck down by an arrow and lands at Niki's feet. Attached is a note explaining that Niki's girlfriend, Princess Margo, has been kidnapped by the evil Stone Wizard. With the cry of "Will help you!" Niki bursts through the wall of his school and sets off on his quest to save Margo.

Gameplay:

Kid Niki is armed with the Spinning Sword, which according to the game's manual, "has been passed down from generation to generation from the School of Chirin."

In addition to the spinning sword, Kid Niki can gain extra offensive power by collecting Bells. The Golden Bell allows him to launch a projectile every time Kid Niki spins his sword, and the Silver Bell creates a spinning force field around him. Both of these power-ups last for a limited amount of time.

The game is divided up into seven rounds, with a boss character at the end of each one. These bosses are:

Round 1: Death Breath 
Round 2: Spike 
Round 3: Horned Witch 
Round 4: Green Grub 
Round 5: Mad Monk 
Round 6: Samurai Guard 
Round 7: Stone Wizard 

Sequels and Cameos:

In Japan, two sequels appeared for the Famicom. The first was Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2: Karakuri Land in 1991, and the second was Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 in 1993. Each of the three NES/Famicom titles feature radically different character designs.

There was also a Game Boy sequel called Ganso!! Yanchamaru in 1991. This portable sequel is a unique game and not a port of one of the existing Kid Niki/Yancha Maru titles.

Kid Niki makes a cameo appearance in Irem's NES game, Kickle Cubicle. To see Kid Niki, hold down the A button on Controller 2, and then turn on the game. Continue holding A until the title screen appears, and Kid Niki will appear. This trick also works on the Famicom version of Kickle Cubicle.

History:

Lead developer Ren Kamuchi based the Kid-Niki character on a neighborhood child who would chase his car when the developer returned home from work. Kamuhci incorporated the child's rat tail haircut into the lead character.

The concept for the 'mocking bird' enemy is based upon the classic American novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Developer Data East attempted to secure rights for a video game version of the novel in the late 1980s, but failed. The use of the mocking bird in Kid Niki was an overt attempt to antagonize Harper Lee, the author of To Kill A Mockingbird.

Shortly after the arcade release of Kid Niki, four Japanese youths were arrested for attacking tourists. According to witnesses, the youths chased the tourists while rapidly spinning swords in the style of Kid Niki.

    <desc>Hey, this game ain't so bad! In terms of the series, it beats the hell out of part 2, but it can't quite live up to the standard set by the arcadey genius of the original Kid Niki (FU! FU! FUUUUUU!). Few games ever actually HAVE lived up to this standard, however, so you can't really hold Kid Niki 3 accountable for such a failure. I guess.

Even if you've never played a Kid Niki game before, though, you should still check this one out; at first, it appears to be your average multiscrolling collect-the-keys-and-hit-stuff platformer, but there's a surprising (for an NES game) amount of gameplay variety to be found here. Aside from running around, jumping, and bonking stuff with your bonking stick, you can also slide, charge up for a spin attack, and hang off of walls and ledges, among other such feats. The control's a little floaty, and the game itself seems to suffer from...like, some weird constant jerky glitchiness (Kid Niki 3 appears to be programmed by the same people who did all those terrible early NES arcade ports like Ghosts'n Goblins and Athena, if that's any indication), but other than that, it's a colorful, happy little gem of a game. You play now!

Translation Description:

Everything's translated, including all text and graphics. Well, except for the note in the intro, but I don't think anyone's going to be confused as to what TASUKETE means (hint: your first guess is totally correct). This patch also gets bonus cool points for staying true to the original Kid Niki's bizarrely-translated wackiness. WILL HELP YOU!

    <desc>Basically, here's your typical side-scroller. You have a really cool weapon which can go in all four directions, and you break bells for nifty power-ups and stuff. Other than that, well, there's really not much else to say about the game. Anyway, despite what some people say about Kid Niki 2, it's a pretty cool game, so give it a try if you're bored or something.

Translation Description:

This is a completed English translation including the ending which was broken in previous versions.

    <desc>Translation Description:

Konami made two games based on the American movie, King Kong Lives, released as King Kong 2 in Japan.

The first one, "KING KONG 2: ikari no MEGATON PUNCH" for the Famicom, is what we have translated. It's just an action game.

The second one, "KING KONG 2: yomigaeru densetsu", released for the MSX has been translated for a while now. It is an action RPG.

This translation started out as simply a title screen graphics hack, but then I discovered 2 things:

- it was based on an American movie called King Kong Lives (so we had to change the title screen more than we were originally going to)
- there WAS some japanese text in the ROM. We determined that it was special text that only came up only during the ending credits if you hold the correct buttons down. So now, it needed to be translated for a complete patch.

This patch translates the title screen and the 24 different ending phrases.

They must first set out solo and build their individual fighting abilities. Once they each have advanced skills, these courageous warriors will come together to seek out and save the princess. You must help them reach their goal as you are now part of the team that will fight to free the princess from her imprisonment.

Keep your wits about you, plan your strategy and set off on an exciting adventure!

--From the NES King's Knight instruction manual.

Overview:

Beach bums move into Beverly Hills

Back in the '50's (just before Frankie and Annette hit the scene) beach volleyball was uncomplicated. No audiences. No publicity. No prizes. No babes. The guys were just kings of their own little sand castles.

Today, the game has outgrown its Southern California britches. Pro beach volleyball has fans in places as diverse as San Diego, Honolulu, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney. Prize money can go as high as $100,000 for a tournament. If these guys still have a beach bum image, it's a gold-tinted one.

Of course, one thing is still the same in this modern-day sport of kings. And that's motivation. It's all about being King of the Beach, where the royal garb is a golden tan and the queen is dressed in a leopard-skinned bikini!

--From the NES Kings of the Beach instruction manual.

Overview:

Kings of the Beach is a pretty fun volleyball game. The graphics look good. The sprites are well drawn, and so are the backgrounds. There isn't much of a story, it's just you trying to be the best volleyball team you can be. The gameplay is fun because you can play against a friend or go for the gold against the computer. The controls are kinda slow, but they are simple. The only thing I found difficult was spiking the ball. You use both of the buttons, and you have to time them just right with a set from your partner. The sounds were decent. The music is good because there isn't too much of it, and the sound effects were pretty realistic for a NES game. Overall, a fun game to play.

Directions:

Play against other teams in 2-on-2 beach volleyball. You must beat all challengers, in order to be crowned as King of the Beach. Or, you can battle your friends in two-player mode. You can also practice by choosing a game mode named after the aspect of the game you want to practice: bump, set, or spike.

When serving, you have two options. You can press A to throw the ball, and then press A again to jump-serve it. Or, you can just press A and B at the same time and serve the ball without jumping. The latter is much easier to perform, but it will be much easier for your opponents to field.

Most of the time you won't have to move the player you're controlling too much, he will move to where the ball is landing on his own. The only time he won't is when it's too far away. If you press A to hit the ball, you will bump the ball. If you press B, you will set the ball. After your teammate sets the ball, you can spike it by pressing A and B when the ball is on it's way down. Your timing will determine how hard the spike is. You can also press the directional pad in the direction you want the spike to go. 

Controls:

A Button: Bump
B Button: Set
A and B Button: Spike/Block
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: N/A

Hints:

Stage 5
To get to stage five, put in the code Australia Sundevil.

THE QUEST THUS FAR...

Long ago, in the kingdom of Daventry, there were three magical treasures that kept the kingdom strong and prosperous: A magic mirror that foretold the future, an enchanted shield with the power to overthrow any invaders, and a treasure chest that was never empty. These treasures were taken from Daventry by deception and stealth, and without them Daventry grew poor and weak and King Edward, once a stout-hearted and vigorous ruler, had become powerless and sickly. Edward had no heir, and everyone feared the chaos that would result upon his death.

King Edward asked his bravest knight, Sir Graham, to embark upon a quest to recover the three treasures. Graham's quest was successful, and as his reward, King Edward named Sir Graham his heir and granted him the throne of Daventry.

King Graham was a wise and kindly monarch, and with his great wisdom and the return of the three treasures, Daventry prospered once again. But Graham knew that he must soon marry and establish his own royal line with an heir to the throne. He searched far and wide, but no maiden in the kingdom possessed the qualities he sought in a queen.

One day King Graham saw in his magic mirror a vision of a lovely young woman held prisoner in a crystal tower. The mirror told him that her name was Valanice, a girl both beautiful and good, who had been stolen from her home and taken to a far land. Graham vowed to find her and set her free. After a long journey with many trials, he did, and asked her to be his queen.

In time, Queen Valanice and King Graham became the parents of twins, a son and a daughter. Life in Daventry was peaceful and good - for a time.

In a land far away lived an evil and powerful wizard named Manannan. It was his wont to kidnap infant boys and raise them to be his slaves, eliminating each in turn before he was full-grown and could pose a threat to the wizard's dominance. His most recent vassal, a boy he called Gwydion, was, however, unusually bright and perceptive. He mastered several of Manannan's spells and cast one against him which turned Manannan into a cat. With that, Gwydion was free!

After a time, Gwydion's travels brought him to Daventry, not the lovely and peaceful Daventry of days gone by, but a land devastated by a terrible affliction. The kingdom had fallen victim to the ravages of a dreadful three-headed dragon, which had burned the land all around and drove many people away from the town.

Gwydion was able to use his newly found powers to destroy the dragon and rescue the intended victim from its lair. He was taken before the King and Queen and rewarded in such a way as he never could have imagined in his life as Manannan's slave.

In later years, King Graham's health began to fail, and the royal physicians were powerless to help him. Only a magical fruit from the faraway land of Tamir could bring about a cure and restore the health of Daventry's monarch. Graham's daughter, Princess Rosella, set off in pursuit of this healing magic for her father. On her journey, she performed many brave deeds, and had many great adventures.

With the King's health fully restored, and his family together once more, it was a happy and fulfilled Graham who set out for a walk in the forest one spring day almost a year since Rosella had returned from Tamir. The kingdom was peaceful and prosperous again, and the people were content. Birds were singing in the trees. It seemed an auspicious sign.

As Graham was contemplating his good fortune, a sharp wind blew into the wood from the east, whirling up sticks and leaves into his path, and startling the birds into silence. The air grew suddenly colder. It seemed an unexpected storm was approaching. Graham began to walk back to the castle, his joyful mood broken by a dark foreboding.

When he reached the top of the gentle rise overlooking his home, he was horrified to see only empty space where the royal castle of Daventry had stood only minutes before. Cold fear gripped his heart. Where was his family? What had happened to them?

"Whoo-hoo... whoo-hoo." An owl hooted behind him, but Graham scarcely heard it over the pounding of his heart. "I can tell you what happened," came a voice behind him, and Graham spun around to confront a large owl in a blue vest and spectacles. "I know what happened to your castle. I saw it all," said the owl.

Journey into the magical world of on a mission to find the missing castle and the royal family of Daventry.

--From the NES King's Quest V instruction manual.

Overview:

One day King Graham was walking around, taking it easy and thinking about things. When he arrived back to his castle, he was shocked to find only an empty space where the castle used to be. Graham's family and castle had been taken captive by the evil wizard Mordack.

With the help of the wizard Crispin and Cedric the owl, Graham sets out on another adventure to find his family and rescue them from the evil Mordack.

Directions:

"King's Quest V is an adventure role-playing game in which you control 

all the movement and actions of the main character, King Graham. You will spend a lot of time in the game traveling to interesting - and sometimes dangerous - places. You'll look for useful items to help you reach your goal. You will also talk to people to get information and clues. On the screen in front of you will be Graham and his sidekick, the wise owl Cedric." (instruction booklet)

To perform actions such as talking to people, looking at things, and picking up and using items you will use an icon bar that will display at the top of the screen. 

Controls:

A Button: Perform specific action
B Button: Pick between look, talk, and action icons.
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Make icon bar appear. Press the control pad left or right to cycle through all the icons.

Hints:

Getting what you need from the desert
WARNING: You may not want to read this if you want to play through this game and solve everything by yourself. This will just tell you what you need from the desert and how to get it but not what you need to do with the items afterwards.

Start at the fortune tellers wagon and go left until you reach some water with a big temple in the background. Hide before you drink the water until the horseman enters and leaves the temple. Drink some water then go down, down, down, left. Then drink some more water from the oasis and go right two screens. You will be at some remains of a dead guy. Pick up the boot and head back to the oasis for water. From there go down, down, left. You should be at some tents. Go in the one to the right and pick up the staff in the back. Be careful not to wake up the guy, and do not forget to get more water from the jug before you leave again. Then backtrack to the temple. Go up to it and use the staff to knock on the door. (You have to see the horseman go in and out of the temple before you can do this.) Then pick up the gold coin and magic lamp from the inside of the temple. You will use these both later. Exit the desert back from where you came. Do not forget some water before you journey back or you might not make it.

A crisis in Dream Land!

Light years away, .......
... on a tiny star not visible from Earth, is the magical, peaceful place known as Dream Land. The beings that inhabit this wondrous world live in a blissful existence that centers on eating, sleeping and playing. An example of their care-free customs include the traditional after-lunch feast nap. After they awaken from their nap, the Dream Landers discuss their dreams and fervently hope that each other's fondest wishes come true.

One day, a young Dream Lander named Kirby awoke from his after-lunch nap feeling terrible. "What happened?" he wondered to himself. "I didn't have any dreams during my lunch nap!" After talking to some of his friends, he found that the problem was much more serious than he had thought, for they had not experienced any dreams either! "Something must have happened to the Dream Spring!" they exclaimed in unison.

Legends told that the Dream Spring was created by a magical artifact known as the Star Rod. The sparkling star on the tip of this scepter was an actual fragment of a star that had landed in Dream Land in the distant past. The Star Rod now provided energy to the Dream Spring and served as the very symbol of Dream Land.

Kirby, the roly-poly hero of Dream Land, boldly announced his intention to investigate the Dream Spring and find the cause of all the trouble.
Upon reaching the Dream Spring, who did he find but King Dedede, bathing in its magical waters! In the past (see Kirby's Dream Land for Game Boy(r)), King Dedede had caused mischief in Dream Land by stealing all the Dream Landers' food and Sparkling Stars. Now, in the middle of the Dream Spring, in place of the Star Rod, sat Dedede, covered with bubble bath.

"What have you done with the Star Rod?!"

"Oh, that old thing," Dedede said nonchalantly. "I broke it into seven pieces and gave each piece to one of my friends..."

Before hearing any more of what Dedede had to say, Kirby set off on the long trek to gather the pieces of the Star Rod and return them to the Dream Spring. Hopefully, he could return the sparkly to the Dream Spring so that the people of Dream Land could again enjoy their happy midday naps."

--From the NES Kirby's Adventure instruction manual.

TIKI'S TREK

Like all Kiwi birds, you are happy and fun-loving; even your name, Tiki, means happiness. You and your Kiwi friends live in a land called New Zealand, and today something awful has happened. Wally Walrus, your bad-smelling, bad- tempered enemy has swooped in on his balloon and carried off all your friends. Worst of all, he snatched your girlfriend, Phee-Phee. Thanks to your fast reflexes you, and only you, escaped the Walrus. But by now he's had time to sell your friends to zoos all over New Zealand. The only one who can set them free is you, so armed with your trusty bow and arrow you set forth. You will have to fight your way through five worlds, and each world has four levels. Wally, that fiend, has sent out hundreds of his evil friends to try to stop you - they lurk behind walls and trees, they drop in on hot air balloons, and they lie awaiting you in the water down below. But if you explore secret rooms, you'll find magical gifts and awesome weapons. Somewhere you'll meet the dreaded Ice Whale - try looking him in the mouth! And most important of all, be on the watch for the Warp Zones. You seek your Phee-Phee, but must face all dangers to find her.

Sofel takes life simulation into the future with Klashball, for the NES. In a stadium hundreds of years from now, techno-gladiators do battle, combining contact with speed and finesse. Two five-man teams go for it, each fighting to deliver a three-kilo metallic energy sphere into the opponents goal zone. Teams challenge each other in a surreal arena that utilizes devices such as a warp tunnel, ball launcher, and magnetically charged bounce domes. Klashball features a complete league system. There are 11 rowdy teams, each with unique skills, strengths, and weaknesses. After each match the central computer analyzes the outcome and records the stats. Play against the computer or klash it out with a friend. If you're ready, take a trip into the 23rd century with Klashball. A game so real, it's in your face!

No matter how tough it gets, the hardest part is pulling yourself away from this fun, fast, and totally addictive game!

Your life as Michael Knight actually began with the death of Michael Long. You were once a young top detective. But while trying to chase down a gang of international criminals, you were tragically gunned down. It was then, with the aid of Wilton Knight, president and founder of the Knight Foundation, that you were miraculously revived. Your face was altered with plastic surgery. You were adopted into the powerful Knight family. And your name was changed to Michael Knight. 'Take over my dream and fight the evil forces in this world,' were the last words of your mentor, Wilton Knight. And now, with KITT-the most sophisticated vehicle ever assembled-your challenge is to do just that!

Knight Rider was a great TV show in the eighties. I loved it when I was a kid. All my friends loved it too. This game gives you the chance to become the Knight Rider in order to fight the evil forces in this world.

--From the NES Night Rider instruction manual.

Directions:

While the show did very well and was very entertaining, the game fell short, unfortunately. It used the same game engine as Rad Racer, it even had some of the same glitches. This was the only thing that was good about the game. The sounds and controls sucked. It was hard to maneuver around the vehicles that you weren't supposed to destroy, and you had to hold up the whole time to keep your foot on the gas. While holding up, it's kinda hard to steer to the left and right. This game was a pretty cool concept gone bad. If you are a big fan of Knight Rider, this game may hold some interest for you, but other than that......

    <desc>Saint Seiya franchise is probably one of the most well known (and long-playing) both in Japan and in the West, containing several manga tomes, animations and games. This one is the end of the so called "Gold Cloths Period" in Seiya's timeline and as I can guess - this is also continuation of the obscure RPG game released on NES a bit earlier.

    <desc>Umm, this is an RPG, I guess? It's hard to tell, really. The game here is the French version of the Japanese Saint Seiya game. It's also very confusing, since it seems to follow the anime's plotline exactly, which means anyone who doesn't already KNOW the plotline is totally lost. It's got crappy platform elements, where you punch people, and then it's got the menu-based combat, where you charge up various stats, or something, based on how much cosmos you have, which I have no idea how to replenish. So yeah this game is weird.

Translation Description:

The translation is also very weird, though you have to admit the font rocks. A lot of stuff doesn't make any sense, mostly because the game's so confusing, but also because the game gives no indication of who is speaking at any one time, which is a LOT more frustrating than you may think. This may be the game's fault though, or maybe different characters have different distinguishing dialects, or hell I dunno. In short, it ain't pretty, but it's in English and the font rocks.

Here they come. And there they go. They just keep coming, you gotta make 'em go away. When you signed on as an intergalactic immigration officer you figured it was an easy way to make some money. You were wrong. Transporting wave after wave of weird wild life from all over the universe is anything but easy. You gotta line 'em up to move 'em out. Up and down, left and right, or diagonally you gotta make the clumps of critters move out faster than they move in. If the room fills to capacity, that's it, the entire system will be shut down. One of the most exciting games of the year, it's more fun than a barrel full of creatures!

In 1999, the Krion Empire robot battalion descended upon the earth, and brought the planet to the brink of destruction. The Krion Empire demanded the immediate and unconditional surrender of the world. When planet Earth refused, the Krion Empire started a massive general attack.

The Krion Empire set up large bases at points all over the world from which they sent out their robots. The robot hordes attacked indiscriminately. Their power overwhelmed even the most advanced armaments of the world. Nearly everyone believed the world would soon be ruled by the Krion Empire.

But now...........

--From the NES Krion Conquest, The instruction manual.

Overview:

The Krion Empire, which is full of robots, have invaded Earth and demand a surrender. But Earth gets nearly destroyed for not forfeiting. So now, a witch by the name of Francesca will use her magic cane to fight the empire and save the world!

Directions:

This game plays like Mega Man. You use your weapons to kill off the robot armies. But there are also a few differences. You get a whole bunch of powers at the beginning, and you get to fire at other directions, which makes easy for above and below combat.

You have 6 different powers: Normal, Fire, Freeze, Ball, Shield, and Broom. With some of your attacks, you can hold down the fire button to make the shot more powerful! 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: No use

Hints:

Broom Power
Don't forget that the broom power allows you to fly.

Everybody's favorite alcoholic clown from the hit animated TV show THE SIMPSONS makes his way to the NES with KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE. It's infested with purple rats and Krusty needs your help to exterminate the little vermin. While Bart and Homer man the rat traps, it's up to you to herd them into the traps, where they'll be taken care of.

Of course, the rats have friends that will stop at nothing to make sure you are unsuccessful snakes, aliens, and flying pigs will all be out to get you, so you'd better be smart and fast if you're going to survive. You've got Krusty's custard pies at your disposal, and while they may not taste good, they do make excellent weapons! Head into the Fun House and get rid of those nasty rats in KRUSTY'S FUN HOUSE.

Upon returning to their homeland after weeks of martial... More arts training, good friends and Kung Fu masters Jacky and Lee find the land in a shadow of gloom, the inhabitants in sorrow. While they were out on their training session, monsters had invaded their land, kidnapping Princess Min-Min and stealing the land's ten treasures.

Hiding the ten treasures throughout eight castles and holding Princess Min-Min in the furthest of them, these monsters are a force too terrible for any of the citizens to take on. The citizens plead with Jacky and Lee to rescue Princess Min-Min and retrieve the treasures so that happiness may be restored to the land. Thus, the friends begin their quest and enter the first of eight perilous castles.

From an overhead perspective, Jacky and Lee will have to trek through each castle, each of which contains four danger-filled one-screen rooms, while fending off the attacks of a large variety of foes. Bazooka-firing soldiers trying to get their sights on them, Coffin Men that will shut them in and hold them for their pals, slithering snakes, soldiers in a number of varieties, and the very large and invulnerable Bison Commandos, among many others are waiting for our Kung Fu heroes. And only after they've destroyed a set amount of these foes, may they progress to the next room of the castle.

    <desc>This is the sequel to Kung-Fu, the oldskool game we all know and love. Except now, you're not a guy that has to save his girlfriend... In this game, you're a police officer that goes and fights crime using kung-fu!

Which makes no sense if you take into account part one's story.

Visually, the game's pretty good. There are little cutscenes between levels where you get messages via a communications unit, either from your friends or someone else *cough*. You fight on top of a subway, on a flying airplane, a mansion, a ship... oh, and you also fight a gorilla. Not since Bad Street Brawler had a game dared to put you against one. And this time it doesn't suck!

Except of course that Circus level boss. Oh sure, you can drain my entire life in three seconds, and my punches don't hit you? Bastard.

Translation Description:

As I said above, this is the sequel to Kung Fu. This game was considered unhackable until occluded hairdo and parasyte proved otherwise.

All the text is translated and a nifty title screen ripped from part one was inserted for all you retro-freaks. There are some issues with some of the grammar in the dialogue [see screenshot #2 for an example] but there are no real spelling errors, and it just adds to the 80's cheese. Thumbs up for such a great job!

In this side-scrolling adventure, you are Kung Fu Master Thomas. Your goal is to punch and kick your way through the ranks of the enemy martial arts gang, to rescue your girlfriend Sylvia from the mysterious Mr X.

Directions:

This is one of the first and remained one of the best games of its type for the NES platform. It doesn't have the wide variety of moves that we're used to in recent games, and, okay, the plot's a little thin, but still this game is a whole lotta fun, which is what it's really all about.

In two-player mode you take turns to see who can get the highest score. Mode A might be considered as "Easy" and Mode B as "Hard" since it comes with a lot more enemies who are also smarter and stronger. The only thing I might have wished for was a mode in which two players could cooperate, but alas, Thomas has to do this on his own.

There are lots of different enemies, so try to use jumping or crouching moves as well as regular punches and kicks to see what is most effective in each situation. Punches generally give more points because they have shorter range.

Finally, after you defeat Mr X and rescue Sylvia, the whole thing starts over again. Why does Thomas keep letting his girlfriend get kidnapped? Too much time in the Dojo, says I. 

Controls:

A Button: Punch
B Button: Kick
Up: Jump
Down: Crouch
Start Button: Start/Pause Game
Select Button: Choose Game Type

Hints:

Extra Points
Defeat the Twelfth enemy on each level using a jump kick to gain 5,000 points instead of the regular score for that enemy.

Alternate Ending
Beat the game twice in a row to see a different version of the ending sequence.

Fight Sylvia
If you beat the game 50 times, you can fight Sylvia instead of Mr X in the final challenge.

    <desc>Like almost everything Technos has ever made, Kunio Kun Soccer is a tribute to violence. It's a sequel to World Cup Soccer, which is the American bastardization of another Kunio game.

Along with all the normal violence you'd come to expect from a Kunio sports game (namely, the ability to beat up other players to gain possession of the ball), this game offers some other interesting features. You have some weather effects, which make things more difficult by adding stuff like wind gusts and lightning strikes (which fry anyone who happens to be standing in a puddle). ALl the weather effects seem to tax the NES, however  thanks to good old slowdown. YOu also get to strategize, and tell the other players what to do, though most oftne they'll ignore you and run in circles and pass the ball to absolutely no one.

It's an alright game, but there's probably much more soccer fun to be had elsewhere.

Translation Description:

Well, as far as everybody knows, there is no Japanese left in this game. It's definitely playable, all the menus and such are in english and readable. However, the nitpicky-ness in me must point out the non-menu stuff sounds kind of odd, and there are plenty abbreviations which seem to be the result of a lack of screen real estate. Given that fixing all that would require major-league reprogramming, you can't totally knock PentarouZero for it. In short  it's playable.

~Version 1.2 adds some fixes and such~

    <desc>I don't know why GameFAQs refers to the game as "Reverence". I mean sure, you could think that if it were written out in katakana, but the name's right there. Maybe it's different on the cover box or something.

Well, if you guessed that Labyrinth is based on the Jennifer Connelly movie of the same name, then you guessed rightly. I've never seen the movie, and I can't understand the game, so I can't tell you much about it, except that you're in a Labyrinth, and that Jennifer Connelly is hot and sexy.

You pretty much just run around and shoot things that randomly pop up and attack you, and you can pick up various items. What's neat is you don't have a life meter; whenever you get hit you lose time. When your timer goes to zero, it's Game Over. Fortunately you can pick up little clocks to increase your time left, or you can buy time from people. Pretty interesting. What's not as cool is the fact that whenever your character gets hit, he flashes so that he doesn't get hit again for a second. But during that time, you can't move at all. So it's very easy to just sit there and get pummeled by this guy, and you can't even so much as run away from the fellow. It's not so bad, cause you can still shoot when you're immobile.

The problem is those faeries! When they can fly over obstacles and move wherever they want at random and you can only shoot in eight cardinal directions... Well, it gets pretty goddamn annoying. And do they always have to come in packs of three or more? Also, a manual would be nice for this game. I'm picking up hearts and necklaces and books and such, why? What do they do? It is a mystery.

Translation Description:

This patch is now currently offered here at RHDN. This patch was previously only available at the Suicidal Translations page. Unfortunately, Suicidal Translations has died, and the author, Inverse, is unreachable for potentially several years due to a personal situation.

At this point and time, the translation group, this project, and the author are defunct. We are offering this patch under the assumption that Inverse would have wanted his work preserved.

This patch was considered Beta and may have bugs and/or not be fully complete. It was not a final patch release.

A summer offensive in the year 1999. Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six "G" vertical climb in a heartbeat.

From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!

You are Jack Slater, an action movie hero, who takes on the ax maniac "The Ripper", who is holding a school under siege, and Benedict, a villain who wants to use Danny's ticket to bring terror to the real world. The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets

The Last Ninja contains a blend of exploration, puzzle solving and combat. The object of the game is to journey to the palace of the evil Shogun Kunitoki to destroy him and retrieve the sacred scrolls. As the player progresses, Kunitoki's henchmen become more challenging as they learn the ways of the ninja. The interface consists of the opponents' energy and collected inventory (on the right) and player's health (on the bottom).

The world is viewed in an isometric perspective allowing the player character to move in eight directions. Movements are relative to the direction Armakuni is facing but restricted to predefined paths (the scenery being inaccessible). Composure and precision must be used when navigating and jumping (using a somersault) around obstacles, traps and fatal features of the terrain. By approaching and kneeling at certain landmarks, such as shrines to Buddha and water fountains, an indication of what to collect next is revealed. These items are often hidden in trees or bushes and flash shortly after entering a new screen.

Ostensibly based on the 1984 movie, The Last Starfighter is... More actually a port of the 1985 Commodore 64 game Uridium. Apart from the title screen, soundtrack and the abbreviated names of characters on the high score list, it has no real connection to the movie. The C64 version is well regarded, but this port is bland and lifeless, with simplistic graphics and a hard-to-navigate ship. Running into obstacles is all too common, as the flat, top-down perspective makes it difficult to determine the height and placement of objects.

A long, long time ago a woodcutter's family lived in a small woods. One day, inside their house, the grandmother was talking to her grandchildren. "Long, long ago there was an evil dragon that was terrifying the people. A wizard came from the north country, captured the dragon, and put it deep in the ground. See the picture on the wall? The wizard is your grandfather."

Just as the grandmother pointed at the picture, their pet dog "Pochi" came in with a shiny, pointed object. It was a scale from the dragon! Mother and Father both felt the dragon was about to revive. So they started to get ready to go to the dungeon. Their mission was to destroy it. The kids cried, "There's no way that you can ever beat the dragon!" Father smiled and said, "Don't worry, there is a DragonSlayer."

"DragonSlayer" is a magical sword - the only weapon that can destroy the dragon. However, it is protected by four hidden crowns. The kids said, "We can help you find the crowns if it's OK with you." "Sure, if we can all help each other, we will be able to defeat the dragon," the Father replied.

Where are the four crowns? Can the Drasle family destroy the dragon? Now the adventure begins.

--From the NES Legacy of the Wizard instruction manual.

Overview:

Legacy of the wizard was a very good game. There was a good story and the difficulty level was pretty high. It took a long time to figure out. The graphics in this game were pretty good for the time. The controls left a little something to be desired due to the lack of responsiveness. Overall this was a great game that every classic gamer should try at least once. 

Directions:

Use every member of the Drasle family to destroy the dragon that was once captured by their ancestor. There were a lot of possibilities, considering that there were things to do that you had to have a certain family member to do.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Start/Menu
Select Button: Select/Choose Item

Hints:

Sound Test
Move the pointer to the painting on the wall in the house at the start of the game. Press A on controller 2 to hear various game music.

Overview:

In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.

Controls:

A Button: Input letter on Register Screen, Use Sword
B Button: Backspace on Reg Screen, Use selected item
Start Button: Items Menu
Select Button: Select game file, Pause

Hints:

Save game
Press Start on Controller #1 to bring up the pause menu. On Controller #2, press Up and A, then a screen with the options 'Continue, Save, Retry' will show up.

Second Quest
To start your game in the second quest, enter your name as "ZELDA".

Can you help guide a pack of hopeless animals away from death? Based on the classic puzzle game, this one's full of mindbenders, brainteasers, and fast action. Your job is to identify each animal's special talent and use it to help save the others. For example, one lemming might be good at blocking, while another might be a particularly gifted builder.

Full of original gaming ideas, perhaps this title's best feature is its Self-Destruct button, which causes each lemming to explode. Where else are you going to find that?, Can you help guide a pack of hopeless animals away from death? Based on the classic puzzle game, this one's full of mindbenders, brainteasers, and fast action. Your job is to identify each animal's special talent and use it to help save the others. For example, one lemming might be good at blocking, while another might be a particularly gifted builder. Full of original gaming ideas, perhaps this title's best feature is its Self-Destruct button, which causes each lemming to explode. Where else are you going to find that?

Bonjour. Now's your chance to rewrite history as one of the most legendary Emperors the world has ever known Napoleon Bonaparte. In L'EMPEREUR, the French Revolution has just ended, and now the people are in search of a worthy leader. It's time to prove your worthiness on the battlefield.

Take control of the Grand Army and lead an offensive against the rest of Europe as you seek to lead your French countrymen to dominance over the continent and eventually the world! While you're in charge on the battlefield, you'll also have to make important economic, social, and political decisions on the home front that will affect how your people look at you. Will you be able to lead France to world domination, or will you suffer the same fate as the real Napoleon Bonaparte?

THE BIRTH OF ZELOS COULD MEAN THE DEATH OF ZILLIONS

In a remote quadrant of the universe there was hatched a hideous creature. His proud parents, Ma &amp; Pa Deltoid, named their only son Zelos, which in alien lingo means "one mean son of a gun."

As Zelos grew into an adult space monster, his appetite turned ravenous, his temper became ruthless, and his name proved an understatement. It didn't take long for Zelos to leave the nest and go out on his own, devouring everything in sight, including three galaxies, four hundred planets, two trillion life forms and a side order of stars.

Then your innocent galaxy appeared on Zelos's menu, and he chowed on an entree of roast Gradius, with the planit Latis for dessert. Now, the only chance these civilizations have of escaping from his digestive tract lies with you and your starfighting partner.

But your odds look pretty grim, for Zelos is full of floating armada terror zones, which are cities that have become a part of Zelos after being eaten. Each of these zones is loaded with tremendous firepower and unbelievable destructive suprises. You'll also find that Zelos's heart and soul are positioned safely behind his traitor fleet.

That means you'll have to devastate the six Terror Zones and pblast away their grotesque mayor before reaching Zelos's main artery and putting an end to his eating binge.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Disney Interactive really outdid themselves with this much loved classic game, and really helped the NES go out with a positive shine once this game was added to it's library.

Story:

Exactly like the movie. You play as Simba, a young lion prince who is destined to become king of the Pridelands. However, Simba's father is brutally murdered by his evil uncle, whom forces Simba into exile. It's up to you to help the cub grow into a king and regain his throne (okay, so it sounds kind of corny, but it does follow the movie to a tee).

Graphics:

The graphics are pretty much your standard NES type, but it often appears in some levels that the objects are more textured and detailed than you would expect. Most of the characters and scenery in the game are very small compared to what's in the game on other systems--but remember, this IS the NES, it doesn't exactly have the capacity for more detail. Some of the characters are very hard to distinguish and the concentration it takes to figure out what's what can distract you away from the game itself from time to time. This really isn't a huge flaw since there aren't many enemies on the screen at one time, but it can be a little frustrating. Despite it's flaws, it seems the NES is really pushed to its utmost limits with this game.

Gameplay:

Almost perfect. You perform the same moves in this game as you do in the SNES, Genesis, etc. versions (and the layout of the game is almost the same too). You can jump, snarl, and pounce on enemies. Once Simba is older, you can roar, slash, and maul your enemies among other moves. The downside to this section is that the movement can lag a little on occasions, causing the controls to become sluggish. It is understandable for this game to have a bit of slowdown, although it doesn't happen very often. The controls are a dream too, every action is easy to maneuver and they really allow you to feel like you're in total control (which is, of course, a good thing).

    <desc>This is a fun little puzzle game. Basically, you are a ghost, and you run around with a rope. Basically, you have to use the rope to encircle blocks that have apples or power ups in the middle. The power ups do many things, the most useful of which is to make the ghost's rope longer so you can encircle more blocks at one time. Couldn't tell you what guy said, "Hm... ropes... ghosts... apples... Let's make a game!" What I can tell you is that guy, whoever and wherever he is, is a genious, because it's fun.

You get your choice of 16 teams to play, eight domestic teams and eight foreign teams from Asia and Europe. In One-Player mode you play the computer in an international tournament. For Two Players, you each have a squad in the tourney. All games are seven innings long.

To help you pick a team, Power Analysis screen enables you to see how teams rate on hitting, pitching, overall defense, and running. When you're up to bat you can move around in the box, control your swing, and bunt. Pitcher's have a choice of fastball and changeup, and curving the ball left and right.

On defense, all players can dive for balls or jump up to snare line drives. A great defensive plus here is the ability to move players into pre-set defensive shifts, for example, to defend against pull hitters or bunts

BUBBLE TROUBLE

Flounder, Sebastian, and Scuttle have bad news. The Evil Witch Ursula is taking over the whole ocean! To save her friends, Ariel gives up her human form, and her prince, Eric, to rush back to the foamy depths of the sea. She must stop Ursula!

But the sea has changed. Ferocious fish prowl through coral reefs. Scary ghosts and eerie eels haunt the sunken ship. Sharks and spineballs lurk, and horrible halibut fish hide in the sand, waiting to turn Ariel into fish food.

But Ariel has tricks of her own. Her bubbles snare the finny fields and put them in a trance. Now they're harmless! Ariel can also knock out critters with magic shells, and find sunken treasures that make her faster and stronger.

But every ocean has its special guard. At the end of each maze, frightful creatures try to end Ariel's adventures. When she finally reaches Ursula's gloomy undersea lair, Ariel must destroy the huge witch whose evil powers control the sea.

The player controls a stick figure, collecting all the gold in the level, and avoiding robots trying to catch the player. The levels feature a multi-story brick platform motif, with ladders and hand-to-hand bars suspended in the air offering multiple ways to travel within the level. The player can dig holes into the brick floors and temporarily trap the robots.

The player may safely walk on top of a robot trapped in a hole. Over time the turf regenerates. If a hole is filled before a robot escapes, it is consumed and immediately respawns at a random place at the top of the level. The player's character can fall from an unlimited height without being injured, but cannot jump, so it is possible for the player to become trapped in a pit and have to abort the character life (the game starts with five lives; each level passed earns an extra life). Certain parts of turf are trapdoors through which the player and robots will fall.

The player's character finishes each level by collecting all the boxes available in that level and traveling to the top of the screen.

The main focus in on the playing board where random pieces of different shapes are presented to the player. The player must then try to make loops out of them. Once a loop is completed, all pieces involved disappear.

There exist three different play modes, two of which can be played with two players. The third mode of play starts with a loop already created and then takes away random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in after they show up.

Lot lot is a puzzle game. The goal of the game is of extreme simplicity. Manipulate the balls in such a way till they fall into the pits and generating points.

The game has five pits: Out, 0 points, 10 points, 30 points and 50 points.

Each level starts by giving you a target score that you'll have to reach before you continue to the next level.

The screen is divided into sixteen sections. The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen.

On the screen you will find two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one but with a slight delay and it stops at the same position as the first one.

The arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the balls to the empty section move your first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section. If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly.

Now you have to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will generating points by getting them to the pits that generate points.

In the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the red line with it's razor sharp claws. The balls will disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and you loose a life.

And the music has a sad creppy tone to it. So if your craving for a challenge, help Luigi end this nightmare?



This hack to me is very special to me cause it was insipred by Mikachu's Mario Panic 4. Luigi from SMAS SMB is the star. And this hack is yup...challenging, don't go insane &amp; don't complain about the difficulty of the hack, it'll make you strong if you finish it. ;) 

Game A and Game B? WTF?

There's two versions of Luigi's Chronicles, Game A is the regular hack that plays like Super Mario Bros. Game B makes the enemies act different and you get a new power up, there are two endings in this hack. The Good ending and the Real ending. Enjoy Luigi's Chronicles everyone.

In this pool game, you get to play pool on the moon, hence the name, Lunar Pool. This game is a lot of fun, and was one of the first pool games on the NES, so if you like pool, give Lunar Pool a try!

Directions:

The goal in this game is to knock the balls into the holes. You need to hit them with the cue-ball. On the moon, you can decide what you want the friction on the pool table to be. Be sure not to put it too low, or it will be super hard not to scratch. There is also a plethora of different pool tables on the moon. They come in all shapes and sizes. The object in the one-player game is to make all the balls on the table in the least amount of shots possible. You get more points for each ball as you make them in a row.

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: N/A

Hints:

    <desc>This is a very early example of the old truism that games based on licensed properties are by default Bad. It applies here with crappy movie licenses just as it applies to crappy Japanese games with anime licenses (hi Banpresto).

The story is a continuation of Castle of Cagliostro: Clarisse is (again) kidnapped, and everyone races to the rescue. You can choose which of three characters you want to control: Lupin shoots short distances, Jigen shoots long distances, and Goemon uses his badass close-range sword. I'm sure there are other differences, but they don't apply to the first level, and none of you will pass the first level anyways.

For starters, this is one of the cheapest games ever. It's an early game, so the jump physics might be excused, but enemies that suddenly appear in front of you in the middle of a long jump that you can't actually see the end of, well, whose bright idea was that? The jumps in the first level are a pain anyways; you have to actually run down the roof to gain the momentum you need to get to the next roof. If you try to keep running at that point, you'll instantly run into an enemy that suddenly appeared directly in front of you.

Toss in the one-hit-kills-you-instantly gimmick, and you've got tons of fun for everyone! Man, I loves me some Lupin, but I defy you to play this game without savestates. It's a pain, man.

Translation Description:

Obviously, not much needed doing, which makes it all the more confusing that at least two people have attempted this translation before. I hear there are still some bugs in this patch, but I didn't see anything. Course, I didn't play very far.

Mach Rider takes place in the year 2112, and planet Earth has been invaded by evil forces known as Quadrunners. The player controls Mach Rider, who travels from sector to sector on a motorcycle, searching for survivors and destroying the enemies in his path.

The game's controls are somewhat more complex than other games at its time. The left and right directions on the Control Pad steer Mach Rider and the A button accelerates. The B button fires Mach Rider's machine gun which can be used to destroy enemies and obstacles on the road. The up and down buttons are used to change gears. Mach Rider's bike has four gears and travels at an immense speed in top gear.

In each round, points can be scored by destroying enemies and certain obstacles with the machine gun. The number of points scored for destroying enemies and obstacles are determined by the power of the enemy destroyed and the type of obstacle destroyed. If the player "BLOCKS" an enemy by knocking it into a hazard on the track, they obtain more points, and this also replenishes Mach Rider's bullets.

    <desc>Madara is an... interesting little oldschool RPG. The plot follows Madara, who was found floating in a river with a fair number of his body parts chopped off. Mechanical replacements are forged, and on his 15th birthday he is sent off to recover his real body and real strength to depose the evil Emperor Miroku and save the Fuduraku continent from the ever-advancing forces of the Moki armies. It's a fairly simple plot, but it's not without its twists. It's also a fairly difficult game, especially towards the end. Don't expect an easy ride on this one!

Sporting an incredible soundtrack (especially for an NES game) Madara's battle system finds its characters acting, for the most part, autonomously. You can intervene and give orders at any time, though. It's fairly intuitive once you get used to it. The patch is out, so go play!

    <desc>
Mad Max is based on the film Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. The object is to survive life after the end of the world by battling survivalists and collecting valuable food, water, gasoline, and money in order to continue racing into the desert wasteland that lies beyond.

The player begins the game in Max's Pursuit Special (his famous car featured in the movie series). As the player drives through the non-linear stage (referred to as a Road War), they encounter enemy vehicles, roadblocks, and dynamite-hurling bunkers. The player is given a very limited supply of dynamite to be used on these threats by throwing it directly at them. In each level, a small, run-down service station can be found, offering goods such as fuel and dynamite, as well as auto repair services in exchange for food and water.

Scattered throughout the levels are abandoned mines, marked by a small shed. By driving into the shed, Max will leave his vehicle and enter the mine. While inside the mine, Max may explore the area in a pseudo-3D environment. Food, water, fuel, and ammunition may be found inside the mines. Enemy survivalists are also present inside the mine, and will protect the items found within, however Max is armed with a shotgun, which also has limited ammo. Additional ammo may be found inside the mine.

The main goal of each level is to enter the arena and battle the enemy gangs. The player must gather enough food and water to trade at the service station for an Arena Pass. Once the pass is obtained, the player must find the Arena, which appears as a large cave. Once inside the arena, the player must be the last vehicle to survive the demolition derby inside. Enemy vehicles drive around the arena and attempt to push the player, as well as each other, off of the road into the abyss below. In addition, several areas of the floor open up at random, leaving vehicles to fall into the pitfall. Once all enemy vehicles are destroyed, the player advances to the next Road War level of the game.

After the third and final arena battle, you will engage in a one-on-one crossbow battle with the final boss of the game. The crossbow and ammo are both collected within the mines on the third Road War level.|

March, 1990

As part of America's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI or "Star Wars") an experimental satellite, SK2, was recently launched into earth orbit. For some unknown reason the satellite has apparently fallen out of orbit and crashed into the Alps. A few days ago, threatening letters were simultaneously received in Washington and the Kremlin. The author of these letters signed in the name of the Mafat Revolutionary Group. At first, however, the existence of this group could not be verified.

Subsequently, terrorists demanded that the American government provide them with the submarine, Los Angeles, a ship carrying missiles with nuclear war- heads. Furthermore, they demanded that the Soviets turn over their research on the military application of electromagnetic waves.

The group is reported to have stated "Unless our demands are met, the satel- lites of the United States and the Soviet Union will fall!"

The disappearance of the SK2 is testimony to the group's power to follow through on its threats.

Confusion and tension has led both the American and Soviet governments to accuse each other of an insidious plot. Pressure between East and West is once again on the rise.

Meanwhile, Washington has ordered the CIA to investigate the so-called Mafat Revolutionary Group. It now appears that Mafat does indeed exist. However, its aims, leadership, and base of operations are unknown. The CIA also reports that Dr. Barrows, the brains behind the satellite capture technology also disappeared several years ago in England, is rumored to be under confinement somewhere in Paris.

As The Mafat Conspiracy is about to unfold, we know that the CIA has delivered an urgent request to Golgo 13, the ace sharpshooter. The directive apparently asks Golgo 13 to:

(1) Eliminate the leader of the Mafat Revolutionary Group.
(2) Destroy the Satellite Capture System.
(3) Bring back Dr. Barrows alive.

As we begin, Golgo 13 has accepted the CIA directive, and has left for Paris.

    <desc>The first thing you will say (besides "hey, that Doropie chick is a hottie") is "God damn, this game is a lot like Megaman". Well, that's because it is. A lot. Especially in the "run and jump and shoot at things" department. There are some notable differences of course, the biggest being the fact that Megaman was never this difficult. In the Megaman games you could, say, regain your health sometimes. And if you died, you wouldn't start over at the beginning of the level, every freakin' time. And you have different weapons at the outset of the game, though all you'll use are the bouncy ball and Rush. Err not Rush, I mean the broom. Haha, how silly of me.

Anyway, this game is too hard to be fun. Fortunately, emulators typically come equipped with savestates.

Oh! This game was released as The Krion Conquest here in the States, but it had a lot of stuff cut.

Translated Description:

Here you go. Magical Doropie, Translated and unedited, unlike that Krion Conquest localization. See more about that in the Readme, It's interesting stuff. Other than that, download the patch and enjoy.

Long ago in a land far, far away there lived the peaceful people of Merlwood. Merlwood was a small but beautiful country with tall mountain ranges, deep forests, and a large lake filled with fish. The people of Merlwood had all that anyone could want: good food, good friends, and great surroundings. At this time, there were powerful wizards and magicians throughout the land. THe art of magic had been refined until all aspects of life were in some way related to magic. The magicians controlled all of Merlwood's major activities, keeping everything in order, without adversely affecting anyone's lifestyle.

Then the inevitable happened: one of the most powerful magicians decided that he was tired of always helping the people. He figured that with a little help, he could easily rule over them, and become the richest, most powerful wizard in all the known land. His name was Abadon.

Abadon used his power to conjure up all sorts of evil beasts, then he went deep into the eastern mountains and built a massive castle. After this was completed, he sent his evil followers out into the countryside, with their first mission being to destory all of the most powerful wizards of the land. Because Merlwood was such a peaceful land, he accomplished this with unbelieveable ease, destroying all of the most powerful wizards, and converting most of the minor magicians.

While all of this was going on in the east, Paul, a young apprentice Magician from Serenna, a small village on the western border of Merlwood, was preparing to depart on his Magician's trek. In order to become a Magician, an apprentice must first travel to the distant corners of the land to learn all of the secrets from the ancient masters. Just as Paul was preparing to depart on his quest, word of Abadon's treachery came to Serenna. There are no wizards left to fight the evil Abadon. The only hope left seems to lie in you, Paul, a simple teenage Apprentice - out to defeat the most powerful Magician in all Merlwood!

Good luck - your mission will be long and difficult, filled with epic battles and magic spells. Along the way, you will meet many friends who can teach you spells, and give you scrolls. There is only one real hope to defeat Abadon: the ancient Ultimate Potion.

Legends say that if the four vials of the elements can be brought together, the ultimate potion will be formed. This is your only hope, Paul: search out the vials of Earth, Air Fire, and Water, form them into the Ultimate Potion, and confront Abadon!!!

Magic Jewelry

Introduction

With Magic Jewelry, Hwang Shinwei created (and RCM published, even without the license from Nintendo) one of the Tetris-inspired puzzle games that possess a high probability for addiction. It is basically the same variation as the better known Columns games that came out e.g. for the Sega Master System, however it was only ever released for the Famicom in Japan and never found its way (officially) to the US or Europe.

The game has (at least part of) its name from the fact that the building blocks consist of differently colored jewels. The 'magic' part possibly is there only for fanciness. ;-)

Story - NA/10

As far I know there is no story to this game, but who needs on in a puzzle game? So umh... on to the next point.

Gameplay - 7/10

The game concept is quite simple. Similar to the genre reference Tetris, blocks are falling down from the top of the screen in a 'quantized' movement, with the play screen being 6 units wide and 13 units high. Each of these blocks consists of three elements in the form of jewels on top of each other. These jewels have different colors (also their form is different, but the color is more easily recognizable). As the player, you can move the blocks sideways and switch the order of the jewels. In order to prevent the screen from filling up and the blocks from reaching the top of the screen, you have to arrange the jewels such that they form rows of (at least) 3 of the same kind, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. This causes said row to disappear and the upper blocks to fall down and fill the free spots. With some luck or even better, careful planning, you can cause chain reactions that way that may clear half a screen and net you a lot of points.

After every 70 jewels that disappeared, a bonus block consisting of three x-symbols appears. This block makes all jewels of the one color disappear, on which it lands. With this, you advance one level and the speed of the falling blocks increases a bit. Thus, the further you get and the more jewels you make disappear, the more challenging the game becomes as you have less time to react and arrange your blocks.

Graphics - 4.5/10

The game is visually very colorful except for the basically black background. The blocks and jewels are mainly distinguished by their color, and this is well done. But further than that and the basic scores indications, there is only one background (or rather sideboard) theme. At least it doesn't interfere with the jewel colors, but nevertheless, that's quite disappointing. So in short, the graphics do their job, but nothing more.

Sound - 3/10

This is a bit of a two-edged sword. The tunes that were implemented as background music change with every new level you reach. And they actually are quite ok, e.g. one I recognized was 'Greensleeves'. HOWEVER, the sound quality is very bad. It is more like unclear beeping notes played one after another offending the ear. So I suggest turning off the sound completely while listening to some music on your stereo instead.

Replayability - 6.5/10

Given the case that you like the concept of the game, replayability is good, as it's of course always the same game. And you can always try to advance to further levels (with increasing speed) and try to beat your point record. However, if you'd like to train your skills at increased speed, you don't have to possibility to do so from a menu - you always have to start out slow.

The strongest point of criticism, however, is that there are no other modes to play. Once you've grown tired of the standard game, there's no further mode, no 2-player mode, no special formation or time attack mode or such, to motivate you.

Overall - 5/10

If you like the Tetris-inspired puzzle games, Magic Jewelry may be for you, too. However, if you already have the 'original' Columns, there's no need to even try out this game. Aside from the (admittedly addictive) basic concept, it offers no additional incentive such as e.g. more game modes, especially nice graphics or convincing music - it's too minimalistic in my opinion. There are better alternatives of the genre out there.

The player controls a player-named hero who is a descendant of the great magician Isfa, who unsuccessfully attempted to defend Arabia from the evil wizard Sabaron. As a result, the Hero's memories are erased, and his beloved, Princess Scheherazade, is captured. Isfa must travel across five worlds to rescue Scheherazade's three sisters, her father, and finally Scheherazade herself. Along the way, eleven NPCs join the party to fight against Sabaron. 

Gameplay:

The majority of play takes place on an overhead map where the player moves between screens, as in The Legend of Zelda. In each world, the player must complete a number of tasks and recruit the area's allies, traveling between two eras of the world using the Time Gate found on a particular screen. Landscapes are numerous and include the tree-lined overworld, towns, deserts, underwater areas, dimly lit dungeons, and palace labyrinths.

The player's primary weapons are a sword, used for powerful close-range attacks, and a rod, used for shooting missiles that travel the entire length of the screen. Magic spells and items are also available for defeating enemies and negotiating obstacles. The character has three classes, a Fighter who uses the currently-equipped sword but who always uses the weakest rod (regardless of what's equipped), a Magician who uses the currently-equipped rod but uses a dagger instead of a sword, and a Saint who can only attack with the weakest rod and a dagger but who is required for certain tasks (like gaining the NPC Pukin in Chapter 3). Changing into specific classes is often required for other quests as well. The player can change classes (for a fee) at a Mosque or by casting the Great Magic spell Moscom during an Alalart Solar Eclipse.

Each chapter concludes with a demonic boss that must be defeated with magic and the rod.

Localization: 

The original Japanese version of The Magic of Scherherazade is a significantly different game than it's American counterpart. Everything from the music, graphics and world maps are extremely different from what Western NES players are used to. The music is simplified and sounds more in line with compositions from 1st generation Famicom/NES games.

Officially licensed by Major League Baseball, the most immediately visible aspect of the game is that it features all twenty-six teams that existed in 1987. In addition, the lineups and the player numbers are accurate to the team rosters that year. Since the game did not have the endorsement of the Major League Baseball Players Association at the time, the team members are only listed by number, not name. This means that, in modern times, it is difficult to ascertain who the actual players are. In addition to their numbers, the players are represented by their statistics, abilities, throwing arm and even placement in the batting order. 1988's Major League Baseball was therefore the first NES game to be officially endorsed by Major League Baseball and to feature accurate contemporary lineups, albeit without the actual player names attached to their numbers.

Managerial decisions are an important focus and, based on the reviews, a large portion of the appeal of this version. Game players are allowed to select their own lineups, although the game lacks Sabremetrics statistics due to the limitations of the era. Instead, the "manager" must make their decisions based on data such as player's average and home run totals. They also have the ability to change and decide who will be a pinch-hitter and who will be a substitute pitcher. One is even allowed to pick out a designated hitter. The game prohibits one from putting out more team members in a certain part of the field than would normally be allowed, which makes deciding which player will be used where a crucial part of the experience. There are three modes that can be played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not accurate to the real World Series. 
Due to the licensing, the teams even appear complete in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the options that a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing and throwing errors.

Gameplay Issues:

Pitching in the game contains several flaws. The quality of the AI means that when the computer plays as the batter, it hits nearly every ball it swings at, making it difficult for the player to perform a strike and only slightly easier to manage a walk. This forces the player to pitch fastballs, which in turn quickly wears the pitcher down to a point where he can no longer maintain the required speed. Furthermore, the pitcher is unable to move around the pitcher's mound. Many are also able to perform the feat of 100 mph (160 km/h) pitches.

Upon contact, the system's fielding is flawed as well. The rapid pace of the batters running to the base, combined with the "erratic" speed of the ball means throwing out an opponent is an extremely difficult feat. The ball's physics have been called into question, with the ball stopping on a dime after three or less bounces. Furthermore, even catching a fly ball requires much effort because of the slow and uncoordinated rate at which the outfielders run. The game's camera system does not function properly either. When a ball is hit, the outfield camera follows the ball looking upwards, making it impossible for the game player to see where their fielders are.

The ball can also be thrown and get stuck in the well between the stands and the field on an overthrow of a baseman, and cause inside the park home runs, which would not happen within a real game (in that case a ground rule double and/or error would be scored instead). Another bug allows players to go into the stands past the wall with the ball if they enter at certain points in foul territory. There are also gameplay issues when the player takes their turn to bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easy to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box, meaning many balls on the edge of strike zone are often missed.

    <desc>Now You're Really Playing with Power:

The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion for the Nintendo Entertainment System

The Untold Story

By Douglas Crockford

I was the on-the-edge new-media/technology guy at the LucasArts Entertainment Company, a spin-off of George Lucas's Lucasfilm Ltd. in Marin County, California. Most of my work was (if I may say so myself) "out there", but sometimes I would take on more mundane projects to help out.

One such project was the Nintendo version of Maniac Mansion. This was going to be LucasArt's first Nintendo cartridge. It was an important project, but the management at Games was overloaded and the project was slipping between the cracks. I volunteered to manage its completion.

The original version of Maniac Mansion was designed by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick. It is a graphic story game, in which you manipulate three teenagers in order to save Sandy the Cheerleader from Dr. Fred, whose mind is being controlled by an evil purple meteor from Outer Space. I didn't contribute much to the original version beyond the package slogan: His ambition was to rule the world...one teenager at a time!

It is usually necessary to make a game run on several different systems in order to have access to a large enough audience to make it profitable. The process of moving a game to another system is called conversion. It is sort of like shooting a movie twice to get a Beta version and a VHS version.

In the course of converting to Nintendo, we had to redesign all of the art in order to conform to Nintendo's screen geometry. We also made some changes to adapt the game to a younger audience.

The bad words we removed, meaning that "The meteor is going to be pissed" was changed to "The meteor is going to be mad." Howie Rubin of Jaleco (the company that was going to publish the game under license) advised us the that the baddest bad word is Kill. The central activity in most Nintendo games is killing things. The image and the act are good, but the word is bad, even if the word does not suggest the image or the act.

The mansion contains a number of arcade video games. One was called KILL THRILL. The name had to be changed. Doug Glen, our Director of Marketing, suggested that we change it to MUFF DIVER, which I thought was a pretty good idea. Unfortunately, I later became aware of the NES Game Standards Policy, which stated in part:

Nintendo will not approve NES cartridges...with sexually suggestive or explicit content

Yikes, MUFF DIVER had to be changed again. In order to minimize the impact on the artwork, I needed to substitute MUFF with another four letter word that was less suggestive that could make sense with DIVER. We settled on the word TUNA.

The standards go on to prohibit

depictions of excessive and gratuitous violence,

which would seem to ban any game in which your character met people, killed them, took their money, and then bought more weapons. But in fact most Nintendo games are still faithful to that theme, so we were unclear as to how to interpret Nintendo's policy. In the Super Mario Bros games, which are considered clean and wholesome, kids routinely kill creatures, and the only motivation is that they are there.

Clearly, interpreting the standard requires skills beyond mine. There was stuff still in the mansion that I thought was suspect, but I couldn't tell if it was out of bounds. I put it all in a Things in Maniac Mansion list. I gave the list to our friends at Jaleco, and they told me not to worry about it.

The way cartridges got made at that time was you submitted a finished game to Nintendo with a letter of credit. If they accepted the game, they would tell you how many units they would manufacture for you, when, and at what price. We submitted Maniac, hopeful that our labors were completed.

A month later we got a report from Nintendo of America's censors:

NOA has discovered the following problems with this program version:

1) There are several places in the screen text that could be felt to be offensive to NES players. Please ammend [sic] the following:

        "For a good time EDNA 3444"

This message is written on the wall in the shower in Dead Cousin Ted's bathroom. Obviously, you can't have a good time in a Nintendo cartridge. We couldn't erase the message completely because phoning Nurse Edna is an important event in the game. We changed it to simply "Call Edna 3444".

         "getting your brains [sic] sucked out."

This is from Dr. Fred's first scene with Sandy. Dr. Fred actually says "getting your pretty brains sucked out." They didn't state what their objection was. Were they afraid that NES players would be offended by threats against an innocent woman, or by the mention of a vital body part (brain, in this case) or by the horror of brain damage? No, it turned out that the problem was that the language was too graphic. I was told that changing sucked out to removed made it ok. In the same spirit, we voluntarily removed the Disco Sucks poster from the Green Tentacle's bedroom. We also modified a medical poster in Dr. Fred's office. The caption on a detail of the head had read "Chewy Caramel Center." It now reads "Pretty Brains."

"Well, Mommy, I'm worried about him. Well, Mommy, I'm worried! He hasn't eaten in 5 years. YEAH, SO!!! and he's been bringing those bodies, and he carries those bodies to the basement at night." [sic]

This was from Weird Ed's dialogue with his mother, Nurse Edna, in which Ed tries to get his mother to recognize the terrible things that have happened to his father over the past 20 years. What was Nintendo's problem with the dialogue? Was it the brutal exposition of parental neglect in the disintegration of an American family? More likely, we thought they had a problem with the dead bodies in the basement, which was essential to establishing the Frankenstein movie parody flavor of the program.

In fact, Nintendo's interpretation of the speech was that Dr. Fred was a cannibal, that he was eating the bodies. That was never our intention, so we changed Ed's speech to "He hasn't slept in 5 years," which helps to explain why Dr. Fred is never seen in his bedroom.

But even if we had intended that Dr. Fred was a cannibal, what's the harm? He would have been one under the influence of the evil purple meteor. The game recognizes that it is bad, and your mission is to rescue him from this unhappy state. Who would be offended?

We expected to get nailed on Nurse Edna's character. Most of her speeches were sexually suggestive. When she locks kids in her dungeon, she will now say one of the following:

"You'll be safe here until the police come."

"Just wait until I talk to your mother."

"I have half a good mind to talk to my husband."

I wanted her to comment on the Nintendo scene, by saying

"You deserve to die, but I believe it is wrong to take any life."

but that might be viewed as a religious belief, and so be held to be an anathema to racial, religious or ethnic groups. It is ok to seek out creatures and destroy them with fireballs, but it is not necessarily permissible to say that it is wrong.

Nurse Edna's obscene phone call definitely had to go. I considered replacing it with "No, I don't have Prince Albert in a can, why do you ask?" but that still gives kids an example of abusive and illegal telephone behavior.

So instead, we have Edna confuse the caller with Dead Cousin Ted. Edna never knew of or never accepted Ted's death. When the phone rings, Edna assumes that it is Ted and starts talking. Her number is unlisted. Only Ted had it. A natural mistake. This also partially explains why Edna's number is written on the wall in Ted's bathroom.

2) Also, there are several places where nudity needs to be removed: the posters in the gym, and the statue in the hall.

There were two posters in Dead Cousin Ted's room: A swimsuit calendar, and a mummy poster. The mummy is in a playmate pose, completely wrapped in bandages, no skin visible. We ended up removing both.

The statue was a classical reclining nude. I told one of the Nintendo minions that it was a Michelangelo (the sculptor, not the turtle). There was a glimmer of hope that we could keep it if it was really art, so I sent Gary to find a book of Michelangelo's work, in the hope that he had made a statue that was similar. In fact he had, a work called Dawn, for the Medici Chapel.

Nintendo's minions said we could keep the statue if we did something about the crotch. But if they could see pubic hair where there is none, what would they see if we tried to hide it?

We removed the statue.

3) There is also a reference at the end of the game to an "NES Scumm System" that we're not sure we understand. Please advise as to the meaning of this reference.

In the credits, which are shown after the conclusion of the game, there are two occurrences of the word Scumm, which stands for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion. Scumm is the story game development system which was used to produce Maniac. They understood, and asked "What is NES SCUMM?" That is the version of Scumm that we did for the Nintendo. "Yeah, but it says NES SCUMM. What will people think?"

I don't know what people will think. And we will never know what people will think. I took it out.

They didn't object to the nasty stuff that happens to the hamster. Ron suggested that it was just violence.

People from Nintendo say with pride that even though they are growing, the number of letters they receive from special interest groups is declining. They insist that their standards are not intended to make their products bland, but that is the inevitable result.

Part of the formal product submission includes a complete listing of all of the game text. They scan that for occurrences of the bad words, but they are also looking for religious artifacts.

Nintendo is a jealous god.



Things in Maniac Mansion

Hamster:

Sid or Razor can be ordered (by you) to put the hamster in the microwave oven and blow it up.

If a kid then gives the hamster remains to Weird Ed, then he slowly realizes what it is. In the next scene, the kid is replaced by a tombstone in the front yard.

Dr. Fred comes to Weird Ed, saying that the evil meteor needs a hamster and an electric cattle prod.

Nurse Edna:

When she locks a boy in the dungeon, she says "I should have tied you to my bed, cutie."

When she locks a girl in the dungeon, she's says "You're lucky you aren't a boy."

When someone calls her from the phone in the library, she says "Is this a prank phone call? There's no heavy breathing. Let me show you how to do it."

Purple Tentacle:

When he locks a kid in the dungeon, he says "I hope you rot."

Meteor Police:

He calls the Purple Tentacle Sucker Face.

He calls the meteor Crater Head.

Meltdown:

If the reactor blows up, everyone within a five mile radius dies. (This is a cautionary story about home nuclear power.)

Mappy is almost always busy at work as a policeman. But, today he is on vaca- tion. Mapico is his girlfriend, and Mappy wants to marry her if he can find the ring that was stolen by the Guchi Gang. Today is Mapico's birthday and Mappy bought many wonderful presents for her.

Unfortunately, Nyamco and Muky of the Guchi Gang have stolen, and hidden them somewhere in the eight areas of Mappyland. Mappy will be late for Mapico's birthday party, and he may never have a chance to look for the ring unless you help him find the presents.

Other exciting adventures await, as Mappy tries to capture the Guchi Gang with some very odd weapons that include fish, fireworks and bowling balls. Only you can help. Are you clever and brave enough to accept the challenge?

MOVING THROUGH THE MAZE

On each raceway, you must try to move your marble through a 3-D maze toward the Goal Line. At first, you'll have to search for the Goal Lines. Once you know where they are, you'll be able to get there faster!

--From the NES Marble Madness instruction manual.

Overview:

Marble Madness was a pretty fun and original game. The challenge rating was pretty good too. The controls were kinda weird at first, but once you get used to it, it's easy. The sounds in Marble Madness were very enjoyable. I especially liked the sound effect when your marble falls off a cliff. It sounds like he yells or something. The three dimensional obstacle courses are well drawn, and there are several interesting ways to see your marble die, from getting broken into pieces, to melting in a pool of acid. Marble Madness was all around a very fun and challenging game. I suggest you give it a try.

Directions:

First, you will need to put in your name and pick which way you would like to control your marble. Then, you must navigate through each obstacle course within the time limit without falling off the edges. You can cut some corners, but be careful because if you fall too far you'll die. There are also several enemies that will try to knock you off, eat you, or dissolve you. There are two penalties for dying, you waste time, and you lose points. You will be awarded extra points for time left on the clock at the end of a level. Sometimes, a wand will appear and award you extra time. There are six levels of madness for you to "marble" through, each one getting harder as you go along. Good luck!

Hints:

Extra Time
As you always get a time bonus for beating the other player, choose 2 player mode but only play as 1 player. Player 2 will always lose, giving you bonus time!

    <desc>Best hack ever

Easily the best ROM hack I have ever played. Most Rom hacks are more of the same, which is cool because I usually play because I liked the original. This, however, really feel like an evolved game. Like Super Mario Brothers 3 Part 2.

The Worlds all have a completely new theme. A couple old themes are recycled, like the ice world and desert world, but they have a new feel to them. The giant world is also recycled, but in a really cool way.

The most major change is the new power-ups and the fact that you can switch powers on the fly during the level. This creates totally new strategies. It's really sweet to be able to fly with a raccoon tail over a difficult platforming section and then quickly switch to fireballs to blast something on the other side. The new power-ups added to the game are also cool, particularly the invisible cap which grants temporary (limited) invincibility.

New weather effects are neat to switch it up, but the snow is really annoying and I'd usually just suicide instead of trying to play through snow.

My biggest critisism is that the backgrounds lack variety, mostly because of the weather thing. If you've seen one level in the rain, you've seen them all. This is a really minor issue, and didn't take away from the experience very much at all.

Read the instructions that come with the ROM or you'll almost definitly miss some of the cool new features - because when you get to about World 4 and figure out you need to find a key in each world you're going to wish you read that thing.

Some of the levels are particularly challenging. Don't give up.

Description:

As of 2006, this is hailed as one of the greatest NES hacks of all time. This Super Mario Brothers 3 hack changes the game right down to the core by tweaking the actual game engine itself!

Aside from the 'typical' graphics and text changes, this hack alters musical melodies, a full line up of all new levels, new power ups, new abilities for Mario, and even new enemies! When I say new, I'm not talking about changed graphics; I'm talking about completely new power ups and monsters. Money mushrooms, invisible Mario, time stopping potions, Kuribo shoes in any level that don't disappear, shy guys that create projectiles, heat seeking bullet bills, and others are just the beginning of the changes made to this game.

On top of that, you have random weather patterns on every stage, boss battles on every stage, and infinite lives, so your coins go to more useful purposes. They will be used to buy items from Toad's house and get some level exits to appear. Let's not forget stored, and switchable, power ups such as those found in Super Mario World!

This description really doesn't do this hack justice. It's certainly impressive to say the least. Just download it and try it out! It's definitely one of the most advanced SMB3 hacks to date and pretty darn fun as well!

You can play alone, or team up with a friend as Mario and Luigi tackle this underground adventure together. There are plenty of cagey critters to conquer -- turtles, crabs and fireflies, to mention a few. You'll progress through endless levels of challenge collecting gold coins and building your score as you go.

--From the NES Mario Brothers instruction manual.

Overview:
Selling over 1.6 million copies, this arcade game port was, to say the least, very popular. The game was a lot more successfull here in the U.S. than it was in Japan. It looked just as good as it's arcade counterpart, graphically, and the sounds were well ported also. The controls were easy to learn besause there were only two functions, move and jump. The story is kinda silly with it being set in the sewers of New York. This arcade mega classic offers a lot of fun and a ton of replayability.

Directions:

Mario Bros. features two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there.

The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase.

Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.

Like many other arcade games at the time, Mario Bros. features a scoring system. Points may be earned in a number of ways, be it by collecting coins or defeating enemies. The player may get points by defeating multiple enemies one after the other, and the player may participate in a bonus round that gives him or her an opportunity to gather more points. Enemies are defeated by hitting them from below the platform they are on to flip them onto their back, and then to them and kick them, ultimately defeating them. If the player allows the enemy to get up, the enemy will be angry, and have increased speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with a more powerful enemy indicating the final enemy in that phase. Enemies come in variantsfor example, Sidesteppers, a type of crab, are usually red, but when they recover from being flipped or if they're the final enemy, they will turn blue and become faster than before.

Each enemy has their own mechanicsthe Shellcreeper, a type of turtle, can be made vulnerable by hitting them from below once, the Fighter Fly, a type of fly, jumps into the air every once in a while and must be hit from below when they are not in the air, and the Sidesteppers must be hit twice from below in that fashion to become vulnerable.[18] Another enemy is called a Freezie, which has the ability to melt down and freeze the platform it is on, making it more difficult for the player to control Mario or Luigi. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
Start Button: Pause, Unpause
Select Button: Choose between 1 or 2-Player Game

Hints:

POWs
Be sure to save the POWs for when you really need them, you only get three at a time.

    <desc>This is the final cut to the game called "Odd Mario Bros. 3? which can be found on many ROM sites. Ringodoggie added some pretty neat ASM changes all well as slick clever level design. People thought that this hack was lost, so now you get to play another great ROM hack. Try the hack out, you'll be glad you did?

    <desc>This is a hack of our old-time fav Super Mario Brothers 1 for the NES. Mario has been abducted by Cyber-Ridley and taken to Zebes, and Samus' mission is to save Mario so he can go back to Mushroom Land to save the Princess.

The hack was created by me and took just a couple of months. Specifically, I've worked on this project from December 2003 to February 2004. Every level and almost all graphics has been changed from the original game. The fireball movement has been changed as well!

Well, the title pretty much sums it up. Mario is Missing! Bowser has kidnapped Mario to prevent him from stopping his newest scheme. The Koopa King has unleashed a plot to wreak havoc across the globe by stealing artifacts from historic sites around the world.

Luigi must travel from city to city throughout the world, with help from Yoshi, recovering the stolen items from thieving Koopas, and searching for Mario to finally foil Bowser's dastardly deeds!

The graphics in Mario Is Missing seem a bit primitive by our standards, but I think it's mainly because we're used to seeing Luigi, Yoshi and the gang, in cartoon worlds rather than a pixelated representation of our world. In any case it doesn't take away from the gameplay, which is fun and quite educational.

    <desc>This is a hack of a Japanese NES (famicom) game called "Nuts &amp; Milk" that I completed overnight in the summer of 2000. The gameplay was simple but fun, yet the graphics were absolutely horrendous. You controlled these little animals that looked like a cross between a pig and a mailbox. Thus, I decided to hack in some graphics from SMB3. I think it makes the game much more bearable, and I hope you think so too.

Game Story (hastily concocted): Toadworld has been infiltrated by the evil Wario clones. You, Mario, must save your friend Toad from the Warios. Collect all the mushrooms and leaves, then hurry and save Toad before the Warios stop you!

How to Play: All the items in this game should be familiar to anyone who's played Super Mario Brothers 3. The Mushrooms and Leaves are GOOD. You must get them all before you can save Toad. The Warios and Boos are BAD! Avoid them or you'll lose a life. Don't fall in the lava, that stuff is hot. As in SMB3, the notes will bounce you into the air, the vines are for climbing, the clouds and blocks are for walking on, etc. In the Bonus Stage, you must again collect all the items and then proceed to save Toad.

What's Been Hacked: Sprites/Tiles? Virtually all sprites and tiles have been replaced with SMB3 graphics. A few notable exceptions: The vines are actually from Donkey Kong Jr. I really wanted all the game elements to be as close to SMB3 as possible but because of the way the tiles were set up in the original game, I was forced to improvise. I believe I drew the mushroom house on my own, using some smaller tiles from SMB3 as a reference. Title Screen? Basically copied from SMB3, with a bit of rearranging on my part to create the "+ Toad" part. Palette? The palette isn't perfect, I know this. I did my best to match the colors up appropriately but I was forced to compromise at times (most notably, with the "splashing" lava). There were also some palette changes that occur at the Bonus Stages that I could not find in the ROM. It is most noticeable when you successfully complete a bonus stage the background becomes black and the arrangement of stars looks decidedly ugly. Because this was a "just for fun" project, 
I had no interest in devoting the time to fix these little palette goofs.

Tools Used: Tile Layer, for the graphics changes. Hexposure, for the palette hacking.

Notes on Future Releases: There will be none, at least not by me. However, if you find this game endearing enough to want to expand on this hack, or at least clean up some of the flaws in the palette? please feel free. If you do, give yourself a credit on the title screen and repost it for the world to enjoy.

Marvel's X-Men is a Nintendo game by LJN in which the object is to use several X-Men characters, each with special powers, to complete a series of missions. The powers of each character come in handy on particular missions. For instance, Cyclops' eye-beam is useful on the factory level. The game allows for either one or two players.

Available Characters and Bosses:

The characters available are Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler and Iceman. The bosses were, in the following order: Boomerang, Sabretooth, Juggernaut, The White Queen, and Magneto.

Features:

Each character had an unlimited attack (either a punch or some type of projectile) and a special move that used on their energy and would kill the character if it was used up too much. The game required the player to fight their way to the boss in each stage, sometimes requiring the collection of items such as keys. After the boss was defeated, the player then had to quickly fight their way back to the beginning of the level before a bomb went off.

Reception:

The game is thought by many to play it to be poorly designed and unfairly difficult. One of the difficulties with the game was that the player was forced to choose one of two directions in which to chase the boss. If the player guessed wrong, they would have to fight their way to the beginning again and head the other way. Adding to the game's frustration was the fact that the final level could only be accessed with a secret code.

Return to a mythical time in the Far East, when the legendary Siamese-Twin Shiva, God of Destruction, cursed your village with fearsome evil spirits. Despaired by repeated failures to drive out Shiva's evil demons, your best friend, Master Hu, has turned into a drunkard. You, Master Chu, must search through hostile palaces and temples to find and destroy this four-armed incarnation of Shiva. If you would like, just ask your teammate, the Drunkard Hu, to help out. Playing together can be a lot of fun!

Gameplay:

The game has 10 levels, or rounds, as they are called in the game. In the first 7 rounds, the player must collect 8 symbols of harmony (which resembled red and white yin-yang symbols) scattered throughout the area. Some symbols are hidden and may be found by shooting certain objects in the level. Successfully finding all 8 symbols will transport the player to the level's boss. After beating the boss, the player must then find the Flaming Key of Freedom hidden in the boss's room to proceed to the next round.

In rounds 8 and 9, the player simply fights a boss three times and is awarded the key. In round 10, the player fights two more bosses with Shiva in the background and after defeating them, Shiva is fought. Successfully defeating Shiva wins the game.

Both Chu and Hu have similar attributes. The player may fire shots of energy with the A button and can use a fan with Chu or knife with Hu with the B button that can defend against certain projectiles. The player may find various items that can restore health, grant invincibility, extra lives, or increase the number of shots fired.

There are numerous enemies and obstacles in the levels to harm the player. If the player has the item that increases the number of shots, being harmed by anything will downgrade this item. When all lives are lost, the game is over, but the player may continue an infinite amount of times. Continuing on any rounds past 7 will take the player back to the start of round 7.

    <desc>Well, you can tell from the screenshots below that it's not that complicated of a game, but it's still helluva fun to play. You play as two characters, Popolon and Aphrodite. I assume that the two of them have different skills or something cool like that, but I can't figure it out. I think Aphrodite can like, smash those weird-looking blocks or something cool like that. Anyway, it's just a fun game where you get stuck a whole lot, which, you know, makes sense, since it's a maze and all. So in short, fun game.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated except the title screen, but no one cares about stuff like that. You already know what the game is called, right? The only weird thing is that due to space constraints, Popolon and Aphrodite are now Poplon and Venus. Get over it.

While spending the night in their tent, Mick and Mack decided to read about Ronald's adventures. One sunny day while Ronald McDonald is performing magic tricks at a picnic, the Hamburglar runs off with Ronald's Bag of Magic. The Hamburglar is hiding in the worlds of McDonaldLand. The M.C. Kids must collect the Puzzle Cards for each level to track down the Hamburglar and return the Bag of Magic to Ronald McDonald. Keeping them from their quest is a variety of unique creatures sent by the Hamburglar to keep the Bag of Magic to himself! They must hurry, before they are too late!

Mick and Mack went to sleep and were magically transformed into the M.C. Kids. Being Ronald's friends, they want to catch the Hamburglar just as much as you do!

--From the NES M.C. Kids instruction manual.

Overview:

Don't judge a book by it's cover! This is not a lame licensed game based around flipping patties and struggling to make rent. M.C. Kids is a great platform game with a large exploratory element.

Directions:

Take Mick or Mack through McDonald Land and find the missing cards. The game plays largely like Super Mario Bros 3, and if you liked that game you'll like this one too. 

You don't take out enemies by jumping on their heads, instead you throw blocks at them. Press B to pick up a block. If it is below you, press down and B. B again to throw it. You can aim which way it's thrown with the D-pad.

To clear a stage, break through the goal at the end. If you land on the moving M you get a bonus round.

There are many cool level gimmicks, like walking on the ceiling of the first level by running over the gears. You'll have to experiment to find all the hidden secrets!

At first, it looked like just another revolution. But reports have come in that the rebel forces are backed by an unusual array of high-tech weaponry - and that the rebel soldiers may actually be a fearsome new breed of fighting robots! If this revolution succeeds, the safety of the entire world may be threatened... And that's where you come in. You must attempt to infiltrate the island base of the rebel forces. But before you even reach the shore, you'll have to contend with enemy gunboats, frogmen, choppers, and destroyers. If you make it to the island, you'll find it patrolled by enemy soldiers armed with machine guns, daggers and grenades; vicious attack dogs; and lethal airborne probes, programmed to destroy intruders on sight. Other unknown dangers lie in wait as well. But if you manage to reach the rebel headquarters, you will face the most terrifying threat of all - only no one has made it back to reveal its nature!

You'll be equipped with a complete arsenal - an assault gun, rocket launcher and grenades - to provide you with a fully mechanized system of attack. You haven't got a minute to waste - it's time to launch your MECHANIZED ATTACK!

Mega Man takes on a more futuristic look, and his much-lampooned jump animation has been changed. Many of the minor enemies look different, and Ice Man is somewhat more menacing.

Beyond that, the game is exactly the same. Any FCEU movies recorded with the original Mega Man ROM will work exactly the same under Mega Man Alpha.

If you were looking for a Mega Man III hack with new gameplay elements and enemy actions, I'm afraid this isn't the hack you're looking for. If you are looking for a challenge, though, you might want to consider trying it out.

Well, they finally made up. Dr. Light and Dr. Wily are together again and working on a massive peace-keeping robot named Gamma. Oh, how wonderful that the bad guy is finally good; or is he? When the eight Robot Masters that were designed for good go haywire and steal the power crystals that power Gamma, Dr. Light calls Mega Man back on the scene. This time Mega Man has a new friend, a robotic dog named Rush. Also, Protoman, Dr. Light's first creation, came out of hiding, and nobody knows whose side he is on.

Mega Man 3 is almost identical to Mega Man 2 in terms of graphics, sound, and gameplay. That, however, doesn't make this game any less compelling. This game is every bit as classic as its two predecessors, with a few new additions. This game is fun and worth playing.

Gameplay:

This is the first Mega Man game in the series to feature the ability to slide, remaining an important ability in later installments (with the exception of Mega Man 9). This is also the first game to feature Rush, Mega Man's canine companion, taking the place of the Item Number tools.

Controls:

A Button: Jump, pick up items
B Button: Shoot weapon, pick up items
Start Button: Make menu appear
Select Button: No use

Hints: 

Super Jump and Invincibility; Press 'right' on controller 2 and Mega Man can jump much higher and walk across the bottom of pits. For invincibility, have Mega Man jump into a pit, then press 'right' on controller 2. Wait for the energy bar to go black and jump out of the pit. Mega Man will be invincible as long as he does not obtain any energy. Once invincible, the arm cannon no longer works but weapons obtained from bosses do.

One year after Mega Man defeated the original Robot Masters along with Dr. Wily, that crazy man is back with eight new robots of his own design. His sole purpose, to get back at Mega Man for defeating him a year earlier. Now Mega Man must jump back into action and save the world from Dr. Wily's army of robot minions and the eight Robot Masters that lead them.

Mega Man 2 was the most popular of the Mega Man series. It was named by GameSpot as the Greatest Game of All Time, and it made number 33 in Nintendo Power's Top 200 games list. The graphics of this game are much improved from the original, and the music as been reworked and sounds better and even catchier. Mega Man 2 is also one of the few Mega Man games that held a contest in Japan so that the fans could participate in the design of the Eight Robot Masters.

So enjoy what many believe to be the best of the best in the Mega Man series.

Gameplay:

Mega Man 2 is a platformer and action game like its predecessor, Mega Man. The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight different stages to defeat the bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters. Mega Man gains the signature weapon of each Robot Master after defeating him. The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing the order in which the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages, Mega Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that the he could not otherwise.

After defeating the eight Robot Masters, the player proceeds to Dr. Wily's fortress, which consists of six levels that are played linearly. As in the original Mega Man, the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily's fortress. However, in Mega Man 2, these battles take place in a single room with teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master. The devices can be entered in any order, but are not labeled.

The North American release of the game has two difficulty modes: normal and difficult. The "difficult" setting is the standard difficulty level that was used in the Japanese version, while the "normal" setting makes all enemies and Robot Masters weaker. Rereleases in North America do not contain this feature and instead default to "difficult". The choice of difficulty mode has no effect on the password system.

Mega Man 2 added several new gameplay elements. The E-Tank allows a player to refill Mega Man's health at any time. These are found placed throughout the game. Also introduced is a password system. After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, as well as the number of E-Tanks that the player has accumulated.

Several features available in Mega Man were removed. Unlike the original Mega Man, the game does not keep a running score for the player. The player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once they have been completed.

Development:

Mega Man 2 was developed and published by Capcom. The first Mega Man game did not have a large enough success to lead to an immediate sequel. Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune claims the development of Mega Man 2 was a "rogue effort". Inafune was given the chance to create a sequel on the condition that he work concurrently on other projects as well. The Mega Man 2 development team spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics. Due to the limited amount of cartridge space available for the original Mega Man, much of the leftover design elements from the game were transferred to Mega Man 2.

The soundtrack for Mega Man 2 was composed by a team of three people: Ogeretsu Kun, Manami Ietel, and Yuukichan's Papa, who composed the music for the original Mega Man. The three composers were credited with pseudonyms. Manami Matsumae and Yoshihiro Sakaguchi are credited as Ietel and Yuukichan's Papa, respectively. Ogeretsu Kun is a nickname implying rudeness, geretsu meaning rudeness or depraved in Japanese. Ippo Yamada, composer for Mega Man 7, offered some explanation for this saying that even in 1995 "Capcom... was just beginning to transition from crediting staff members by aliases to their full names."

Reception and Legacy:

Despite relatively low sales of the first Mega Man game, Mega Man 2 was a huge success. Since its 1988 release, Mega Man 2 has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. The game is the highest selling in the Mega Man series and is Capcom's 20th highest selling title. Mega Man 2 was named by GameSpot as one of "The Greatest Games of All Time". It ranked at number 33 in Nintendo Power's "Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever" list. It ranked fifth on Game Informer's list of The Top 10 Video Game Openings. Creator Keiji Inafune claims the success of Mega Man 2 is what made the Mega Man series a hit that continues to spawn sequels. In ScrewAttack's "Top 10 Video Game Themes Ever" video, the Doctor Wily Stage Theme is ranked second in the countdown, behind only The Legend of Zelda Theme.

Many of the conventions of the original Mega Man series were defined by Mega Man, but Mega Man 2 added its own conventions, which were retained by the series. The traditional number of Robot Masters for Mega Man games is eight as used in Mega Man 2, rather than the six used in the original. The Game Boy versions used eight Robot Masters, but they were divided into two sets of four. The E-Tank became the series' iconic health refill item. The teleporter room where the player confronts all of the Robot Masters for a second time has become a staple of the games, replacing the preset sequence used by Mega Man. Mega Man 2 initiated the idea of special movement items, precursors to Mega Man's robot dog companion, Rush.

    <desc>Dr. Wily finally concedes that Mega Man may be too much for his evil robotic creations. Determined to get the best of the blue bomber, Dr. Wily contacts another famous villian, Bowser! Having combined their forces, Dr Wily and Bowser unleash their new destructive creations upon the Mushroom Kingdom. After hearing news of Wily's new plan, Mega Man decides to travel to the Mushroom Kingdom himself to stop Wily again. Mega Man now finds himself in a strange new world filled with obstacles and locales very foreign to him. Fearless, Mega Man presses on to Super Mario's old stomping grounds to defeat these new foes.

Mega Man in the MK is set in various classic Mario games. Including Super Mario Bros1, 2, 3 and World. Megaman faces off against Wily's Bosses as well as Bowser's minions. This being Super Mario's World, he gladly helps out Mega Man by increasing his jumping power as well as outfitting the Blue Bomber with some of his old garbs.

Features:

- The 6 main starting levels have had extensive level design and graphics modifications.

- Every single enemy graphic had been changed in to a Mario themed bad guy.

- Megaman can jump higher.

- Every boss has been made easier, their shots do less damage, Megaman's do more.

- The first 2 of 4 Wily stages have had extensive graphic modifications but only minor level design tweaks (Game engine Constraints)

- The last 2 of 4 Wily stages only undertook minor tweaks to make them less utterly frustrating. (Made easier)

- Minor title screen edit, minor text edits here and there.

- Symbols representing their respective powers have been put in place of letters in the pause/power menu. (A bomb symbol instead of a "B", Fire ball instead of" F")

Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were partners, working together on a new robotics technology. Together they create Protoman, the first of the Robot Masters. After Protoman, they create six other robots designed to aid society. Dr. Light then created Rock and Roll to act as household aids to him. Because of this technological breakthrough, Dr. Light was given the Nobel Prize.

Now, Dr. Wily, jealous and infuriated, stole the six robots made for society and reprogrammed them into robotic warriors to terrorize the public. As a last act of desperation, Dr. Light changed Rock into a super combat warrior named Mega Man to combat the six robots and stop Dr. Wily.

Mega Man is the first in a classic series of video games that had more sequels than Rocky Balboa (And now Pongo's review of Rocky Five..... thousand). The graphics in this game were revolutionary and only get better as you go up in the series. The music in this game had a futuristic feel to it, albeit 8-bit sounds, but definitely keeps the game exciting and has become as classic as the video game itself. All in all, this is a classic game that deserves to be played over and over again, and if you like this one, then don't hesitate to play all the others in the series. Lock and load, and Good Luck!

Gameplay:

Mega Man is made up of six stages, with a Robot Master at the end guarding a weapon. The stage select screen allows the player to choose from these six stages, which can be replayed if they were cleared. When they are all completed, the seventh and last stage appears in the middle of the menu, replacing the text "Stage Select, Press Start". This last stage, known as the Wily Fortress, is in fact more like four regular stages linked together, some a bit shorter than average, but with bosses that are considered harder than usual. During the two final stages, the six Robot Masters must also be fought again as well in a predetermined order, before the final confrontation against Dr. Wily.

The stages in Mega Man are designed in the "platformer" genre. In each stage, Mega Man fights his way through various enemies and obstacles before facing a Robot Master at the level's end. Upon defeating a Robot Master, Mega Man is able to assimilate the Robot Master's signature attack into his arsenal for the rest of the game.

Unlike his standard blaster, however, the Robot Master powers have limited ammunition which must be replenished by collecting ammo cells randomly dropped by defeated enemies. While the player is free to proceed through the game in any order, each Robot Master is designed to be especially vulnerable to a specific weapon, encouraging the player to complete certain stages before others. Some vulnerabilities can be determined by observation (e.g., Fire Man is vulnerable to Ice Slasher) and others only by experimentation. Aside from the weapons taken from the Robot Masters, Mega Man is also able to get a platform generator item known as Magnet Beam, which is mandatory in order to advance through the last stage.

Localization: 

Character designer Keiji Inafune stated in a G4 interview that the concept of the game was inspired by Rock, Paper, Scissors; every weapon and Robot Master has a strength and a weakness.[1]

Due to Nintendo of America's strict rules concerning religious references at the time, the Yellow Devil boss was instead named the "Rock Monster" for the original NES version[citation needed]. Also, when released in America, Capcom was forced to change the title of the game from Rock Man to Mega Man because Scholz Research &amp; Development, Inc. had copyrighted the name for their Rockman amplifier.

(I had heard that the reason they changed the name was because "Rock Man" sounded too much like a drug dealer reference..... seriously... ~Rx)

In the original U.S. Instruction manual, "Dr. Light" is referred to as "Dr. Wright". In Mega Man 2, he is called "Dr. Light". The in-game text of Mega Man 3 refers to him as "Dr. Right". However, "Dr. Light" remains his official romanized name.

In the original Japanese version of the story, Dr. Wily was not Dr. Light's partner. Instead, he is simply a mad scientist who gets revenge on the world for not recognizing his scientific work.

Reception:

Mega Man was rated the 61st best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.

The picture on the game's American box has been criticized as it contains virtually nothing that can be found in the game. Mega Man himself resembles a middle-aged man rather than a boy, and he is holding a handgun instead of his Arm Cannon. The game's cover is commonly ridiculed because of its inaccuracy; GameSpy placed it in first place of its Top Ten Worst Covers list. The European box cover, however, features Mega Man looking more like his video game counterpart.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use weapon
Start Button: Open Menu
Select Button: Pause game

Hints:

The Select Trick
When using a weapon that goes through an enemy, press the Select button (this pauses the game with out bringing up the weapon menu) when the weapon is making contact with the enemy. While the game is paused this way the enemy will continue to flash. When the flashing has stopped, press the Select button again to un-pause the game and the weapon will 'hit' the enemy again causing more damage. You can do this trick repeatedly with many of the bosses, making them very easy to beat.

    <desc>Schwa: Over the years I have had a LOT of perseverations. Megaman was one of them for a while, and while I was in that state of mind I managed to produce my very first Rom Hack of all time, Megaman 4. A Rom Hack is what you get when you take a Rom and change the hexadecimal values inside the file. By doing this, you can pretty much change the game in whatever way you want. That's what I did with Megaman 4, using MegaFLE to help me (which is a Rom Hacking program btw), and the result is new colors, completely new level designs, a few new graphics, and overall a new game to explore! Download away!

Peace has once again come to the world after the defeat of Dr. Wily during the Gamma Project incident. That is, until Dr. Light gets a letter from a Russian scientist, Dr. Cossack, proclaiming himself the top Robotics designer and that he had created eight of his own robots which he will unleash upon the world to test Dr. Light's robots. So Mega Man must be called off his search to find Dr. Wily, and go after Dr. Cossack and his robots. Dr. Light had also given Mega Man an upgrade to his weapon, the mega buster, which gives Mega Man the ability to focus a blast that does more damage.

Mega Man 4 in many ways, mostly musical, is like Mega Man 2. The intro and finale music are identical to its predecessor. The graphics have improved since Mega Man 3, as far as the Mega Buster charging and the general look of the game. This game makes an excellent fourth installment to the classic Mega Man series.

Gameplay: 

The gameplay of Mega Man 4 is nearly identical to the previous installments; however, some additions have been made. For example, players can now "charge" a shot, resulting in a blast far more powerful than the standard shot. Additionally, tools are available, which can aid the player in reaching areas not normally accessible, but must be found in the stages, rather than being awarded for defeating a robot master.

    <desc>This is the first time I have tried to edit a game, and with zero programming skills it wasn't easy. But with some help from MegaFLE X and Matrix I was able to anyway. There are some KNOWN bugs in this hack, but like I said, because of limited knowledge of ASM I wasn't able to fix everything.

Don't get confused by the name, it doesn't have anything to do with the Mavericks. There is no story line in this game, no intro or anything. It's just a game!

The bosses and enemies are generally the same, but the levels have been completely changed, as have some of the graphics

Happy gaming! :)

    <desc>Some of you may have heard about me working on this hack for a while. And I'm proud to announce that it's finally finished!

So anyway, here's the story: Wily has returned to try to achieve World Domination again! He used the same 6 robot masters that he used in his first attempt to destroy Megaman. Only this time, they have no weaknesses! (Or do they?)

This hack features completely redesigned levels, graphics and palette changes, enemy AI changes, and even some custom music! Be careful though, this hack is alot harder than the original Mega Man, so save states are strongly recommended.

So good luck and have fun! ;)

    <desc>Mega Man Showdown IV is the boss-only version of Mega Man IV that makes all stages except for Cossack 1, and Cossack 2 only 2 screens. Wily 3 are where you refight old bosses.

All boss stats have been edited (EX version only), all weapon energy consumption amounts have been edited, except music.

This should be the final version of Mega Man Showdown IV of v1.00 unless bugs are discovered. Also note that Mega Man Showdown IV you start with 0 lives which is new in this Showdown series and you get to choose between Normal and Hard modes depending what patch are you using.

The EX version of Mega Man Showdown IV brings more life to the game. All Bosses are customized to be stronger and harder to defeat meaning that they're hyperactive and the hard mode version patches simply won't give you any reflex time after getting hit.

The original showdown series is created by Vagla of Dragon Eye Studios.

In the year 20XX, the first annual "Robot Masters Tournament" is held. The tournament was designed to test the designing capabilities of the world's greatest engineers. Thus, engineers and programmers (and of course, spectators) from the world over gathered to participate in this event. The tournament was hosted by a man known only as "Mr. X," who was one of the world's richest men and supposedly one of its greatest engineers.

Dr. Light, a pacifist, decided not to enter the tournament, but he took charge and did send Mega Man to go along and make sure that everything was safe for all the spectators and to discipline the Robot Masters. Many strong robots participated, and in the end, eight robots were victorious.

However, at the close of the tournament, Mr. X came to the podium and announced that he had reprogrammed the eight robots to do his bidding and that he had been manipulating the contestants all along. Furthermore, he was going to use his newly created army of robots, under command of the new Robot Masters to take over the world. Mega Man was immediately ordered by Dr. Light to put an end to the madness.

Dr. Light has upgraded Rush to be able to combine with Mega Man to form various adapters, such as "Jet Mega Man", who can fly/hover for a brief period of time, but can't use charge shots, and "Power Mega Man", who can punch huge blocks to destroy them, but has limited attack range.

Mega Man fought and defeated the tough Robot Masters, who were spread out all throughout the world, and then made his way to Mr. X's fortress. After battling his way through, he finally confronted the madman and defeated him. Mr. X removed his fake beard and revealed that he was none other than Dr. Wily. Wily had been posing as the multi-billionaire for an indeterminate amount of time, so it's safe to say that "Mr. X" either did not or no longer exists.

Wily fled to an all-new Skull Castle and Mega Man gave chase, fought his way through it, and defeated Dr. Wily in a final showdown. After the years of fighting, Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice and placed in prison with the proper authorities. As Wily can only "rule over a prison cell", the world is finally at peace...for now.

Mega Man 6 is the last of the classic series to appear on the NES. The graphics have improved from the previous game, most prominently a new intro effect for the Robot Masters. This game is also the first of the Mega Man series where two of the robot masters were designed by non-Japanese. The music keeps to the classic feel, however it is improved and sounds smoother than previous games.

In the year 20XX, after a brief period of peace, an army led by what appears to be Proto Man storms throughout the world wreaking havoc. One day, Dr. Light turns up missing (he had been kidnapped by "Proto Man") and the only clues left behind to Mega Man are a brief note from Proto Man and his signature yellow scarf. Mega Man wonders why his brother is doing this, but with little choice left except to save the doctor, he sets out to stop the madness before it gets out of hand.

This time, his Mega Buster has been upgraded slightly thanks to the help of their new ally, Dr. Cossack, and also, Cossack has created a bird friend by the name of "Beat" to join the cause. Cossack serves as Mega Man's mentor since Dr. Light is in captivity and helps him where needed during this quest.

Once Mega Man defeats the eight Robot Masters who are controlling Proto Man's army, he gains access to his base. After a long, grueling journey through Proto Man's fortress, Mega Man is stopped by a piercing whistle  distinctly more off-key than usual. Proto Man arrives and attacks Mega Man, but both are stopped by another, more in-tune whistle. The real Proto Man appears between them and reveals Mega Man's adversary to be the impostor Dark Man. After Mega Man defeats this enemy, Dr. Wily appears, fleeing to his newly designed castle where Dr. Light is being held prisoner.

Mega Man fights and defeats Wily. He then frees Dr. Light. The victory is short lived: the entire ceiling collapses, but Mega Man raises his arms and holds the entire massive weight, keeping it from crushing Dr. Light and Wily. Wily takes his chance and escapes. Mega Man cannot move from the force that is bearing down on him, all of his strength spent on keeping Dr. Light and himself from being crushed. Dr. Light can't save himself, as Mega Man and the ceiling are both blocking the way.

Just when it seems Mega Man is about to slip, Proto Man's whistle splits the air. A section of the ceiling is blown off, and Mega Man and Dr. Light waste no time in escaping as the fortress explodes. Outside, Mega Man and Dr. Light watch as Wily's saucer flees and the fortress begins to burn. Their timely savior, Proto Man, also watches from afar, unnoticed by anyone.

Mermaids of Atlantis is a puzzle game published by AVE as a clean version of the pornographic NES game Bubble Bath Babes aka Soap Panic originally developed by Taiwanese developer Computer &amp; Entertainment. The original pornographic version was also published in the United States by Panesian and in Japan by Hacker International. The object is to clear groups of colored bubbles as they float to the top of the screen.

    <desc>
Set three years after the events of the original Metal Gear, FOXHOUND discovers that an undisclosed hostile nation may have gotten a hold of the plans for Metal Gear and are secretly constructing a new model. Lt. Solid Snake, the FOXHOUND operative responsible for the destruction of Metal Gear, is given orders to lead a three man team to the enemy's base consisting of himself and two fellow operatives: John Turner, a Navy Intelligence agent and infiltration pro; and Nick Myer, a weapons and explosive expert formerly with the Marines. The codename of the mission is Operation 747.

Snake infiltrates the enemy's jungle base with the help of John, who acts as a decoy by allowing himself to be captured. Snake eventually learns that the enemy are transporting their weapons, a set of mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, on a cargo ship. Snake blows up the ship's ammunition cache and escapes with the help of the team's helicopter pilot while the ship sinks.

The pilot informs Snake that the enemy has a prototype of the new Metal Gear 2 model in their main base and is told to contact their double agent, Jennifer, on the inside. As Snake goes deep into the base, he defeats an impostor posing as John, regains contact with Nick and eventually comes in touch with Jennifer, who reveals that the enemy commander is planning to launch nukes around the face of the globe. However, as Snake approaches the commander's lair, Nick is mortally wounded and dies, while Jennifer is exposed as a spy and gets captured. Snake confronts the enemy's commander, who reveals himself to be a cybernetically enhanced Big Boss, having survived his previous encounter with Snake. Snake defeats Big Boss and rescues Jennifer, who shows him to the storage facility where Metal Gear 2 is located. Snake destroys the weapon before its launch countdown is completed.

In the aftermath of Operation 747, the United Nation declares "World Peace Day". John Turner is declared missing in action and removed from Navy records, while Nick Myer is awarded three posthumous promotions.

Gameplay:

Like in the original Metal Gear, the objective of the game is for the player to infiltrate the enemy's stronghold while avoiding being seen by the enemy. To fulfill their mission, the player must collect a variety of weapons and equipment, such as firearms, explosives and rations, as well as card keys for access to new areas. If the player is discovered by the enemy, the game will enter an alert phase where enemies will rush to the screen to attack the player. The player must kill a set number of guards to resume infiltration. In some cases, particularly when an enemy sees the player and only a single exclamation mark (!) instead of two (!!) appears, the player can merely escape by going to the adjacent screen.

A change to the original Metal Gear formula is the fact that the player now begins the game with a combat knife and a handgun already in their equipment. The player can assign the B button to "punch" or use the "knife". The knife can be used for an instant kill in close range, although enemies killed by knife stabs do not leave behind ammo nor food like punched enemies. In addition to rescuing prisoners, the player can also interrogate enemy commanders by using a unit of truth gas on one. The number of enemy commanders interrogated are taken into account along with the prisoners rescued by the player and the player receives a promotion after rescuing/interrogating a set number of prisoners/commanders, increasing their life energy and carrying capacity, the highest possible rank in the game being six stars. The transceiver has been simplified from the original Metal Gear, with only three set contacts available (John, Nick and Jennifer). The transceiver is disabled when the game enters alert phase. The player can use the radar equipped in their transceiver whenever an ally is transmitting their whereabouts.

The game features a more varied progression of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a cargo ship, and a train, as well as the usual set boss battles. In addition to the regular top-view areas, the player must also progress through side-view areas as well. In the side-view areas, the player can jump and crawl like in most action games to avoid traps, while still avoiding being seen by the enemy. In these stages, the player can switch between the knife and the handgun as their weapon of choice, and use plastic explosives to blow up underwater obstructions.

Production:

Konami produced Snake's Revenge following the release of the NES version of Metal Gear, as a sequel produced specifically for the Western market. Hideo Kojima, the designer of the original MSX2 version of Metal Gear, was not involved in the production of Snake's Revenge. According to Kojima, he became acquainted with one of the staff members working on Snake's Revenge, who told him that Snake's Revenge was not an authentic sequel and requested that a true sequel be made by him. This inspired Kojima to produce his own sequel, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake for the MSX2, which was released as the official sequel to Metal Gear in Japan.

Snake's Revenge was released in North America and Europe with no corresponding Japanese version. The fictional events of Snake's Revenge are ignored in Metal Gear Solid, which follows up on the original MSX2 games instead, and is hardly mentioned (if at all) in any of the subsequent Metal Gear sequels and spinoffs.

Although Kojima feels that the NES version of the first Metal Gear is "complete garbage", when asked about Snake's Revenge he stated that he enjoys the game and thinks it is "faithful to the Metal Gear concept".

The game has been referred in publications by the alternate title of Snake's Revenge: Metal Gear II, although it is never actually used on the game's packaging nor title screen.

Much like the NES version of original Metal Gear and other Konami games released at the time, the packaging and instruction manual for Snake's Revenge features an alternate version of the story that is inconsistent with the actual plot featured in the game. Whereas the game reveals the main villain to be Big Boss, who betrayed Snake in the first Metal Gear, the instruction manual identifies the villain as "Higharolla Kockamamie" (a play on Ayatollah Khomeini), an Eastern despot who obtained the plans for his "Ultra-Sheik Nuclear Attack Tank" (the manual's name for Metal Gear) from Vermon CaTaffy (the supposed villain from the original Metal Gear).

In the year 19XX (later established to be 1995 in Metal Gear Solid), 200km north of Galzburg, South Africa, lies Outer Heaven, a fortified state founded by a "legendary mercenary". Word had gotten out to the western world that deep within the Outer Heaven stronghold, a weapon of mass destruction is being constructed. The United States government orders the high-tech Special Forces unit FOXHOUND to infiltrate the fortress, assess the situation and neutralize the threat. In his mission, FOXHOUND operative Gray Fox infiltrated the Outer Heaven stronghold. Days later, contact with Gray Fox is lost and his last transmission simply reads "METAL GEAR..."

Operative Solid Snake, FOXHOUND's newest recruit, is ordered by squad leader Big Boss to rescue Gray Fox and carry out his mission, "Operation: Intrude N313". Upon insertion into Outer Heaven, Snake makes contact with local resistance members Kyle Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer. Using all of his skills and the equipment he procured on site, he manages to rescue Fox. He learns from Fox that Metal Gear is the codename of a nuclear warhead-equipped bipedal walking tank, which can engage and dominate in all forms of combat as well as launch its nuclear warheads from any location. Outer Heaven plans to use Metal Gear to impose itself as the new world superpower.

In order to destroy Metal Gear, and topple the Outer Heaven mercenaries, Snake rescues the lead engineer of Metal Gear, Dr. Drago Pettrovich Madnar, and his daughter, Ellen. Armed with information on how to destroy Metal Gear, his skill and indomitable spirit, Snake fights through the entire Outer Heaven force. He begins to notice that traps being set for him are too precise, and wonders how information on his activities is being tracked. Moreover, Schneider is ambushed by hostiles and is presumed dead after losing contact with Snake. The final hostage Snake rescues tells him that the mysterious "mercenary leader" of the entire base is none other than Snake's C.O., Big Boss, and that Outer Heaven is under his command.

Upon breaching the core of the base, Snake is able to neutralize Metal Gear before it reaches completion. As he makes his way out of the compound's basement, he is confronted by Big Boss himself; the corrupt leader had been using his connections within the U.S. government to steal military intelligence, establish his own mercenary force, and fund his activities. It was his aim to have Outer Heaven become the world's most powerful nation, able to bring even the western nations to their knees. He had the rookie Snake sent in, hoping to have him captured and feed the U.S. government misinformation, but had quite obviously underestimated Snake's capabilities.

Having lost Metal Gear and much of his force, Big Boss starts the self-destruct sequence for the compound, and promises he will not die alone; Snake will join him. An underground battle ensues, and despite injury, Snake defeats Big Boss and escapes the Outer Heaven compound as it crumbles in flames behind him. After the ending credits, a message from Big Boss is displayed saying that he will meet Solid Snake again.

Gameplay: 

The player must navigate the main character (codenamed "Solid Snake") through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the "Alert Mode." In this situation, the player must hide the character in order to leave the mode. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:

If a player is seen and only a single exclamation mark (!) appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and an escape can be made by moving to the adjacent screen. 

However, if two exclamation marks (!!) appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsilenced weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. The player can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies or by simply moving to a different floor. 

The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually gains access to a variety of firearms (starting with the Beretta M92F) and explosives and working his way up to machine guns and guided rocket launchers. Ammo and supplies for each weapon are limited, but are easily replenished. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles (such as hollow walls or electrified floors). Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up.

The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors or explore new areas. Doors will only open to their corresponding key cards. Bosses also appear throughout the game to interfere with the player's progress.

Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held captive within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player is given a promotion, increasing their "Rank" (up to 4 stars max), allowing for bigger ammo capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.

A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer (Big Boss) or one of the resistance members operating covertly within the fortress. Each of Snake's allies has an extensive knowledge on specific subjects. The transceiver system is completely room-oriented, as certain radio transmissions occur only in certain locations.

The year is 2501, and the dawning of a new century has brought mankind to the brink of disaster. The powerful LaserGun on the planet Pluto's battle station "Cyberg" is wreaking havoc. It was originally designed to protect Earth from hostile aliens, but, due to a computer malfunction, is systematically destroying all the planets in the Solar System! Most recently the Earth Nation watched helplessly as Neptune exploded.

The system's self-destruct device could stop the LaserGun, but it has mysteriously jammed and is aimed at Earth. Even if the device can be manually activated, there is still only a slim chance that Earth can be saved. Your mission is to enter Cyberg using the most sophisticated weaponry available, the M-308 Gunner, and unlock that self-destruct device!

Simple side-scrolling game, where you play a skater who has to pass a set of obstacles in order to reach the end of the level.

You can skate up or down in the screen, or even jump, to be safe from the pipes you encounter on the way. As the game progresses, obstacles are more frequent and more challenging, but the essence is the same. Timing is everything in this game.

    <desc>From the author: "This is a 100% complete patch: Most of the map was totally deleted so the game was built again from scratch. Items are moved, puzzles are changed, and there is no such thing as a dead end. It is hard both mentally and physically, but I avoided such design flaws as having to bomb arbitrary points in the floor or placing enemies so that you get smacked in the face on the way in or out of rooms. Metroid fans should love this! It's essentially a brand new NES Metroid game. Also, minor text and graphics hacks were done, but mostly just for packaging purposes, (As in, the title screen was changed, mostly). If you like Metroid at all, you should pick this up!"

This is a really fun hack, give it a try.

    <desc>A complete hack of the original Metroid for the NES. This has been in production since the final says of TEK and has undergone many revisions. Many well known members of the hacking community have helped in the creation of this. It was quite the adventure making it, I hope you have quite the adventure playing it.

"Great stuff man, i love it."- Omega45889

"The hack is great, I've been playing it on PocketNES, not getting anywhere though, I forgot how much I sucked at the original Metroid"- Dragonsbrethren

    <desc>My intent is to enhance the overall playability of the Metroid engine by providing an entirely new adventure. I have attempted to keep this version of Metroid true to the spirit of the original by making some tricky secrets and convoluted mazes.

Where my version departs from the original Metroid game is the following:

- Much larger overall map; easier to get lost
- Secrets are in some cases harder to figure out
- Placement of enemies is much more devious, requiring you to plan how to get past them without getting the crap kicked out of you
- Respawning occurs with not just Zebs; it also occurs with tougher enemies such as Rios
- All non-missile items are CRITICAL to winning the game
- Important items are locked away much more tightly than before

    <desc>Celebrating the release of Metroid Prime/Fusion, I created Metroid Omega. Every graphic of the game is changed thanks to Jorge Fuentes's great artistic skill, and Brinstar is transformed into an evil deathtrap. Once I finish a few other projects, the rest of the levels will be made just as evil as it, so have fun trying to survive!

    <desc>Most graphics updated to look more like Metroid Zero Mission. Other changes (energy, animations) kept minimal so this can be mixed and matched with other level mods.

    <desc>This is a 95% graphics hack of the NES game, "Metroid." The game features Link (instead of Samus in suit) and a slightly modified Kid Icarus (instead of Samus out of suit). The enemies vary from games like Zelda 2, Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, Mega Man, and a few others. I recommend playing through the whole game to appreciate the full hack.

Space pirates have attacked a deep-space research spaceship and seized a capsule containing an unknown life-form that had just been discovered on planet SR388. This life-form is in a state of suspended animation, but can be reactivated and will multiply when exposed to beta rays for 24 hours. There is a strong possibility that the life-form just discovered was the cause of the planet's destruction. The Federation researchers had named it "Metroid" and were bringing it back to Earth when it was stolen by space pirates!

If Metroid is multiplied by the space pirates and then used as a weapon, the entire galactic civilization will be destroyed. After a desperate search, the Federation Police have at last found the pirates' headquarters, the fortress planet Zebes, and launched a general attack. As a last resort, the Federation Police have decided on this strategy: to send a space hunter to penetrate the center of the fortress and destroy the Mother Brain. The space hunter chosen for this mission is Samus Aran. He is the greatest of all the space bounty hunters and has successfully completed numerous missions that everybody thought were absolutely impossible. He is a cyborg: his entire body has been surgically strengthened with robotics, giving him superpowers. Even the space pirates fear his space suit, which can absorb any enemies power. But his true form is shrouded in mystery.

The planet Zebes is a natural fortress. Its sides are covered with a special kind of stone, and its interior is a complicated maze. On top of that, the pirates have planted devices and booby traps in the maze, and the pirates' eerie followers lie in wait around every corner. Samus has now succeeded in penetrating Zebes. But time is running out. Will he be able to destroy the Metroid and save the galaxy?

--From the NES Metroid instruction manual.

Overview:

Metroid is a classic that has it all. Great graphics, sound, controls, and story line. It is one of the greatest games ever made. Metroid brought us into the SciFi realm and made us a hero. You play as Samus Aran, a bounty hunter of the highest quality. Half human, half machine, and all bad--to the bone. Your mission is to kill all space pirates and destroy the stolen Metroid. This mission will not be easy, but you will pull through using your whole arsenal.

That's right, you will gain new abilities as well as new weapons along the way to make your journey just a little easier. Metroid was the start of a great series and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do. Have fun, and good luck with Metroid. 

Directions:

Space pirates have taken a Metroid, and they are planning to use it against the galaxy. Your job, as the bounty hunter Samus Aran, is to stop this from happening.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot Missiles

    <desc>This is a map edit for the original Metroid. Screens, enemy and item placement, palettes, text... you name it, it's been changed. The primary goal was to make the game more playable - the discerning player will note the careful placement of platforms and enemies to make jumps easier. Not that beating the game will be a cinch. The items are much more difficult to get, the corridors are contorted into winding mazes, and many of the energy tanks have been completely eliminated. Beating this version will be fun but it will not be effortless.

Michael Andretti is on the world tour among some of the best tracks in the world. And you must take control of him. Drive your engine among the others and win the cup!

This game stinks. I had a hard time getting control of my car, it barely could turn. I never got up to speed, and I was driving an automatic. The person who designed this game is good on details of the course, but needs a class in computer graphics and the like.

Directions:

Race your F-1 car around a course to win the cup. 

Controls:

A Button: Accelerate, Go back on course selection
B Button: Brake, Go forward on course selection
Start Button: moves from menu to menu

    <desc>Mickey Mouse Dream Balloon is a localization of the Kemco title Mickey Mouse 3: Yume Fuusen. Technically, one could argue that MMDB isn't actually unreleased, as the game was published in the US as Kid Klown, albeit with a full graphical overhaul and totally different story. The game is a simple platformer, one of many available on the NES at the time. While it isn't a bad game by any means, neither is it an especially original offering to the genre. 

This prototype is of an earlier build than the version that would become Mickey Mouse 3/Kid Klown. The difficulty was tweaked heavily between this version and the final. Enemies have different patterns, bosses take different amounts of damage, and some areas, like part of stage 2, use completely different layouts.

Might and Magic is your basic RPG dungeon crawler. Your sole purpose is to uncover the Secret of the Inner Sanctum... whatever that is. Really, your sole purpose is to run around killing monsters and gaining levels. There seem to be little or no plot points to guide you or indicate your progress through the game.

That's not to say it isn't a great game. For those of us who like this sort of thing, Might and Magic gives us just what we want. Classic Dungeons and Dragons style stats and combat, lots of exploring to do, and plenty of monsters to run into all the while. The graphics are pretty good, if a bit basic. The monsters are somewhat recognizable, although there are more monsters than there are different images to distinguish them. Overall, a good game of its kind, and Might and Magic was one of the originals, and started quite a strong series. if you're not too worried about absence of plot, give this dungeon crawler a try.

Being a parody of the original Final Fight, the game's premise is exactly the same as the original Final Fight. Mike Haggar's daughter is kidnapped by the Mad Gear gang, leading her father, along with Cody and Guy on a rescue mission to save her. However, the story is depicted in a much more comical fashion than the original game. The gang kidnaps Jessica, not to manipulate Haggar, but rather because their leader Belger is infatuated with her and that he wants to marry her while taking over the city from within the process.

Gameplay:

Much like the SNES version of Final Fight, the game does not offer any cooperative game modes and is strictly a single player affair. However, unlike that version, Cody, Haggar and Guy are all playable. Each character has virtually all his techniques from the arcade version (esp. the life-depleting death blows). The extra feat is that once Experience Level 4 is reached, each character may perform a hidden technique performed by simultaneously pressing Forward + Attack. These new techniques have Cody's chi blast, Guy's dual kicks, and Haggar's body splash. Each character also has his signature weapon of preference, found within rolling drums. Such weapons are: Cody's knife, Guy's shuriken, and Haggar's mallet.

Players earn experience points by killing thugs to boost their levels like an RPG. Level-ups during battle heal a player's health to 100%. Subsequently, the player's HP, offense, defense, and speed increases, enabling him to survive longer and learn the coveted hidden potential powers. Stronger characters increase their level more slowly than others. Points can also be earned by picking food when in full health aside from goon-bashing. At the Maximum Level (6), the player can inflict very large amounts of damage with even the simplest combo.

The cute super-deformed child-like sprites and brilliantly colorful backgrounds can be visually compared with those in River City Ransom, as well as those in the NES port of Double Dragon II.

Playable characters:

The translation for Kyoryu Sentai ZyuRanger (Kyouryuu Sentai Juuranger according to GoodNES) is finally released.

The characters may look familiar to you, as this is the Japanese/original version of what would eventually come to America as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.

    <name>Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>After the success of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, another company intended to release an NES 'spiritual' sequel with the help of Beam Software, now Krome Studios Melbourne.

Unlike the series' other entries, this follow-up was slated to star Tyson, and not Little Mac as the protagonist. Familiar trainer Jerome "Doc" Louis was also replaced with Don King's outrageous hair.

The former heavyweight champion started to have public marital and personal problems, and was eventually arrested and brought to court for rape charges in 1991. Some time before this, Nintendo's original NES Punch-Out!!! was re-released -- removing Tyson's presence -- as Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream, though it's unclear exactly what prompted this.

What is known, though, is that Beam's Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch (we'll get into the odd title in a bit) never got released, apparently due to both licensing and quality issues.

So the developer and its new publisher removed Tyson from the sequel, switching him out for a generic fictional boxer named "Tough Guy" Mark Tyler, and American Softworks eventually published a modified version of the title as Power Punch II in 1992, despite the non-existence of a Power Punch I.

17 years later, a playable version of Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch has been made available for anyone to download and play, presumably with an NES emulator.

The story behind the ROM's release began three weeks ago when Jason "DreamTR" Wilson -- known by many in video game collecting circles for his stockpile of rarities and prototypes -- notified the NintendoAge community that he would be willing to dump the data from his prototype cart of Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch for $2000.

Before you castigate Wilson for holding the ROM hostage, one should note three things:

1. He has dumped and released many rare ROMs for others in the past

2. Releasing the ROM to the public devalues his actual cart

3. He eventually lowered the asking price to $1500

Over 50 of NintendoAge.com's forum members raised that $1500, with a couple donating $100 or more, and others even selling games from their own collections to scrounge up contribution money.

The ROM is now available for anyone to download, and RetroZone is selling reproduction carts for the game, priced at $30. NintendoAge even featured the artwork from the game in its monthly e-zine, also listing members who contributed to the ROM's purchase.

Unfortunately, Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch, like Power Punch II, is terrible.

After Don King brags that there isn't a man walking this earth that stands a chance against Tyson, the Intergalactic Boxing Federation challenges the boxer to fight its ridiculous lineup of alien pugilists (some even use vehicles during the fights). Also, instead of ring girls or Mario bookending each round, the game uses ring slugs.

The alien fighters are much too strong, and Punch-Out!!'s dodging and counter-attacking element has been left out. Playing the game is awful, regardless if you're "Tough Guy" Mark Tyler or Mike Tyson. But at least it's gratis to check out (if you don't count the cash donated by other more charitable people), so I guess I shouldn't complain much!

Little Mac: A 17-year-old fighter from the Bronx in New York. He loves nothing better than a tough challenge.

Doc Louis: An ex-heavyweight who was a famous hard hitter in the U.S. around 1954.

It all began one day when Little Mac and Doc Louis met by chance. Doc became Mac's trainer, teaching him everything there is to know about boxing. Doc and Mac's story continues over a seemingly endless path, until one day a champion is born.

--From the NES Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! instruction manual.

Overview:

This is about as simple as it comes, ladies and gentlemen. Those of us who are old enough to remember, this game was the nifty when it came out. Spending hours with our friends trying to defeat these characters, Soda Popinsky is my favorite.

Nostalgia rocks!!!!! This game was released before Mike Tyson's famed ear biting incident. Back when he was untouchable. However, playing the game now, on the other hand, it's a bit easier to beat him (many more years of game playing will do that to a person).

If you played this game in the 80's, step back in time and play it again. If you haven't played it before, give it a shot just to give your StarCraft deserted eyes a break from reality.

Directions:

The game is simple...You are Little Joe. You fight. You win some, you loose some, but if you play it right, at the end you get to fight Mike Tyson (anyone remember him back in the day?)

Controls:

A Button: Right Punch
B Button: Left Punch
Start Button: Haymaker Punch
Select Button: Read Hints

Hints:

A little extra energy
Between the first and second rounds, if you press the Select Button rapidly, Little Joe will gain more energy for the next round. The faster you press it, the longer you press it, the more energy you will gain. It IS possible to refill completely.

Shoot his head to turn him into mushrooms. But that is not the only thing attacking you. There are more creepy, crawling, buzzing, swarming creatures in this forest. Keep fighting with your magic arrow. If you are lucky, you may survive. Watch out, here they come!

Milon lives in the land of Hudson where people use music to communicate with each other However, Milon does not have the ability to communicate. He always ask himself why he is the only one who lacks the ability to understand people and music. One day he decides to travel through Out the land of Hudson to search for other people like himself. Before leaving for his trip, Milon decides to visit Queen Eliza who lives in Hudson's Secret Castle.

When Milon arrives at the Secret Castle, the people were being attacked by the Evil Warlord from the north region. The warlord robs the people of all their musical instruments and occupies the Secret Castle. Queen Eliza is held captive deep inside the Secret Castle by the Warlord and his demon-monsters. Milon volunteers to fight the Evil Warlord and his demons and to rescue Queen Eliza and the musical instruments for the people of Hudson. This will not be an easy task. The Secret Castle has many different rooms and each room is a maze filled with demons, secret passages and doors. However, the Castle?s Magician tells Milon that Queen Eliza has hidden many tools, instruments and money to help him. The Magician also gives Milon a magic "Bubble" to assist him in finding the places where the helpful items are hidden and where they may be bought.

--From the NES Milon's Secret Castle instruction manual.

Overview:

You play as the young tone deaf apprentice named Milon, a wizard. The apprentice has the power to shoot bubbles to kill enemies and other things, too! Now, Milon must find his master in a very large, secret castle by solving puzzles! Can you do it?!

Directions:

You have to kill the baddies by shooting bubbles at them. Use the control pad to control the bubbles! The bubbles can also be used to shoot the blocks to sometimes reveal money, amongst other things. If you get low on energy, use hearts to recover one bar. If you really want to win, you have to collect money to buy stuff at shops. Collect honeycombs to give Milon one bar of energy! While holding medicine, if you touch a boxing glove, you can shrink down to half your normal size. But the real thing you have to worry about is how to get the keys! The keys can unlock doors to certain levels. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot bubble
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: No use

Hints:

Continue
After collecting the first crystal, hold Left while pressing Start to continue the game.

    <desc>The Miracle Piano Teaching System is a MIDI keyboard/teaching tool.  When connected to the console or computer, a user followed the on-screen notes. Its marketed value was as a tool to teach kids and to play the piano. It provided hundreds of lessons, and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons. Due to its prohibitive price ($500) and low sales, the keyboard with all of the original cables together are a rare find. Aside from being released in the United States, the Miracle Keyboard was also released in multiple regions within Europe. The European versions are, however, much harder to find. Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were also later converted for PC use - the Nintendo Seal of Quality on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic.

Students can learn to play classic piano, rock piano or show tunes. Fun exercises making learning the piano seem less like a chore and more like playing a video game. Instead of using the traditional NES controller, the piano becomes the controller as players hits targets in order to perfect their music skills.

There are two games that students can play to help teach rhyming. The first is called Robo Man where you have to press the correct keys at the right time to create a bridge. If you miss, Robo Man falls and you lose. The second game is a duck shooting game. You have to press the correct keys to shoot the ducks.

The Miracle Piano did not ever generate sounds from the NES hardware; all NES MIDI information was converted into audio by the instrument's built-in ROM and played through the instrument's stereo speakers, allowing the keyboard to be used independently of the console.

Searing gunfire inflicts heavy damage on both sides as you slice into a murderous squadron of enemy fighter jets. As the commander of a fast and powerful helicopter, you must face an intense struggle against a pair of patrolling choppers before you are allowed to turbo-boost through enemy defenses to reach the motherships. Only with fast reaction and uncanny accuracy can you defeat the motherships which launch a seemingly endless arsenal of weapons.

DO YOU DARE ACCEPT THIS MISSION???

Not since the cheesy Limberger Case has a kidnapping attracted as much attention as the abduction of Doctor "0". It seems this world-acclaimed genius behind the U.S. military defense system was enjoying the breakfast of braincells (powdered eggs and grape juice), when he and his fetching secretary, Shannon, were mercilessly snatched by the Sinister Seven. Unknown to the Sinister Seven is the startling fact that Shannon - although a very able stenographer - is really an agent from the Impossible Mission Force (IMF), assigned to protect the good Doctor. Using all her skill and cunning. she has managed to send a secret code cluing you in on where they're being held.

But before you and your team of special agents start high-fiving each other. you'll have to go hand-to-hand with scum like Slash Stiletto and Jean Claude Killer. And you must slink your way through Six murderous mazes, from underground warfare off the coast of Cyprus to hand grenade ski runs in the Swiss Alps. Also included in these killer mazes are untold numbers of Espionage Zones!

Before you yodel "Uncle", remember that you have control of three different spy identities - Max, Grant and Nicholas. Each has special talents up his sleeve (like quick-change disguises and remote control bombs) which you'll need to stay alive amid the acid flames, poisonous gas chamhers and much, much more!

So go ahead, Jimbo. Put your life on the line and accept this seemingly impossible mission. Or else the good Doctor will be tortured into spilling the top-secret beans about the U.S. military defense system (meaning you can watch the planet go up in a mushroom-shaped puff of smoke a week from tuesday).

    <desc>Damn, how much cooler can a game get? Okay, you're this guy that shoots bullets out of this dot in his forehead, and you go around killing those Troll things that were EVERYWHERE back in second grade, remember those? And you even kill helpless puppy dogs! It's a real wonder this game never made it over here. But it still would've been a pretty cool game, even though NOA probably would have changed the dogs into something else.. Probably more Trolls, hopefully. I mean, what else is there to say? It's a pretty fun game. You can charge your shot, and throw this odd trident thing, which you can jump on to get to high places. The monsters drop money when they die, and you can shoot the money and it increases in value, which is just plain neat. It's freaky, and really really cool at the same time, just like all good games should be. OK that's all.

Translation Description:

Nothing much to say here. It's a small, quick, complete translation. Download the patch and discover this game's majesty. If that's even the right word. I think it is though.

    <desc>This is a hack of Capcom's Mega Man 2 for the NES. The hack isn't a complete remake of the original game, but all levels have been changed to look different from the original ones. The colors have also been changed, and a new title screen has been made.

This hack includes:

- New levels

- New colour palettes

- A few graphic changes (very few though)

- Various HEX fixes

Version 1,1 (incl. some bug fixes) released on 19 August 2009.

(I feel the need to inform you that Air Man's level is possible, there are ladders hidden in the clouds. Evil.)

    <desc>This is a ROM hack of Capcom's Mega Man 3 for the NES. All levels have been redesigned (incl. scrolling directions), a new title screen has been made, the color palettes have been changed and some minor graphics have been edited. Other things are pretty much unchanged. The levels are harder than the ones in the original game - They're designed to be hard enough to provide some challenge - but not so hard that the hack is not fun to play.

    <desc>This is a very strange game. It's a platform puzzler, and it reminds me somewhat of Lolo for some reason. Anyway, you're this dinosaur-looking thing and you have to collect these things and go through a door. I realise this descrtiption is vague, but it's a puzzle game for crying out loud.

Anyway, as easy as collecting things and going through doors may sound, it ain't! There's all sorts of critters out to get you, and rocks to push around and bricks to head-butt. It's good 'ol fun puzzle-solving. Check it out.

Translation Description:

Yet another of the famed "title screen translations" where the only Japanese text in the entire game can be found in the title screen. So, there you go, here's your game in English. Whee.

Parker Brothers' MONOPOLY Real Estate Trading Game was presented to Parker Brothers during the Depression by Charles B. Darrow of Germantown, Pennsylvania. Darrow had made the first games by hand, given them to friends and sold a few through Phila delphia department store. But as demand grew, he could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to acquire the rights to the game in 1935.

Since then, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States but throughout the Western world. It is published under licence in 32 countries and in 23 foreign languages!

--From the NES Monopoly instruction manual.

Overview:

The classic of all classic board games, brought to life on the Nintendo Entertainment System! Buy, sell, and trade property, trying to ammass the greatest fortune and drive your competition out of business.

Directions:

Monoploy is a game everyone is familiar with, so I doubt I need to explain what the game is about. The great thing about a video version is that it does all the tedious stuff like banking (no one ever wants to be the banker when you sit down to play, unless he's trying to cheat).

Also you can play by yourself against computer opponents, or have up to 8 human players.

One of the great features of this particular version is a Game Editor, which you can use to assign properties and cash to different players before the game begins. This way you can start a game in the middle, as it were, saving time on the first few trips around the board to collect property, etc. 

Controls:

A Button: Confirm Selections, Buy Property
B Button: Cancel Selection, Auction Property
Start Button: Start Game
Select Button: Access Main Menu

Hints:

Computer Players
Each computer opponent has a distinct personality, so you can learn to take advantage of their strengths and weaknesses.

Thousands of history's famous monsters gather for the meeting of the century. But their volcanic convention center erupts, mysteriously turning them into terrors of pint-size proportions. They escape to the home of Jack, the teenage "Captain of Cool." There begins a battle between the good ghouls and The Warlock's band of evil beasts. You must become The Vampire or The Monster and lead the forces of right through a humongous, human-size world six levels deep, featuring Jack's house, a scummy sewer, a hazardous construction site, and an odd oriental palace. Don't get burned on the kitchen stove or crushed by runaway golf balls. Meanwhile you'll have to punch and zap at all your fiendishly favorite monsters including the head-rolling Skeleton, the rock candy throwing Goblin, the bone-crushing Cyclops, and dozens more! Every monster you mash is worth points. Score enough and you'll get an extra life. Something you'll really need when you finally face the powerful Warlock and his magic lightning jolts. 

So be a pocket-size peacemaker and conquer the smallest threat to monsterdom the world has ever known!

The game scrolls horizontally. While using the bat to destroy the monsters, move to the right. Along the way, there will be rooms where "boss" monsters live. Enter these rooms to fight them. When all the "boss" monsters are defeated, you will get a key that will allow to clear the round. A round cannot be compleated until the key is obtained. When MARK defeats the monsters, various items will appear. He must get them by grabbing them. Attack and destroy the monsters by using MARK'S bat to hit and return their photon lazers and other weapons.

    <desc>Wow, this may be the most badass platform game ever. The game plays a lot like Prince of Persia, where you have to jump from platform to platform, do some climbing and essentially avoid falling to your death. There's also plenty of thugs trying to stop you, and collection of some of the toughest bosses I've ever encountered in a videogame. Meanwhile, Ninja Gaiden-esque cut-scenes tell the story in between levels. The graphics are almost on par with the TurboGrafx, and the control is amazingly fluid and dead-on. The more you play this, the more you'll say "damn, they did this on the NES?" It's just that kickass.

Translation Description:

AWJ has outdone himself, in my opinion. The translation is excellent ... pretty near flawless. And that is one of the most ass-kicken-est font's I've ever seen in an Nes game, and that was quite a bit of work because the game's 8-16 is a pain in the bum to work with. Anyways, please check out this patch, it'll be worth your while!

    <desc>The game is a 2D 1-2 player side scroller. You the player control Taka or Yuuji, or both of these characters at the same time. You'll find yourself up against many enemies of the Yakuza gang, "The Silver Stars", and then later on leading you to corruption within the police department and to the main villain at the end. While playing the game you'll also run into three mini-games, which are a shooting gallery, a fast paced car ride and a shootout with one of the boss enemies.

While playing the side scrolling part of this game, if you want to switch weapons, press start and then A to cycle through the selection.

The original name of the game is Mottomo Abunai Deka, which has been retitled as The Most Dangerous Detectives.

All of the text has been translated to the best of my knowledge. The main issue with the text is that there is a scrolling issue that has been worked out as best as possible for now.

    <desc>If Excitebike had a sequel, this would be it. It even looks the same, aside from the 3-dimensional aspect of it. Yeah, you don't just move continually to the right; you actually go around a track. Kinda like RC Pro-Am, except Motocross Champion has bikes and actually is a good game. Up and down control the, er, position of the wheels. Like you know, wheelies and stuff. And left and right steer. Be sure to remember this, because if you don't you'll be running into every wall you see. Actually, you'll be running into every wall you see anyways. But that's not to say that it's a bad game. It's fun, and everyone should play it, so there.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated. Whee! You might notice a lot of the racer's names are (obviously) made up, but it's not really that horrifying of a travesty. Hell, game companies do worse things to their OWN games.

You are one of MotorCity's finest performing your regular duties: patrolling every street, making routine arrests, issuing tickets, and setting up speed traps. Suddenly the calm is broken! There's a crime in progress and you're the first to respond. You contact the helicopter patrol who's already on the scene. Time is of the essence. Using your surveillance map, you find the best route to the scene of the crime just in time to make the collar. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it!

Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back.

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.

IRATA. A New World rich with opportunity. For wealth. And power. And you can become the richest, most powerful inhabitant of the newly discovered planet by owning the most land, mining the most precious metal, and supplying the most food and energy to all the peasants - otherwise known as your opponents. To win you need MULEs (Multiple Use Labor Elements), kind of mechanical donkeys which do your dirty work: growing food, mining, and producing energy. MULEs are critical, so you want to get as many as possible as cheaply as possible. And by the way, treachery is acceptable. So use it when needed. Then sit back and enjoy your wealth and power, OH MIGHTY RULER!

The game consists of five largely unrelated minigames. The main objective is to rescue Miss Piggy from the "Grumpasaurus", a being who has kidnapped her. In order to complete this objective, the player must assume the role of four different muppets (Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal), direct them in the collection four keys and subsequently confront the "Grumpasaurus".

    <desc>Mushroom Nightmare is a hack of the classic game, Super Mario Brothers. It features completely revamped graphics, along with major level editing throughout the game. It also features a new storyline, as the brothers aren't trying to save the Princess anymore, it's the Chancellor they're after.

Bowser has taken the Mushroom Chancellor hostage, and is using his power to warp the landscape to his wicked desire. His forces are all over the land, and the Brothers must come to the rescue again, before the King of the Koopa forces the Chancellor to forfeit his powers to him. This game takes place right after the original SMB.

The brothers now have different abilities! Mario, being the one that previously rescued the princess, is more experienced of the two. He is able to jump higher than his brother. However, due to his larger mass, it takes a longer amount of time and distance for him to stop, after a sprint. Luigi plays exactly like Mario, or Luigi from the original SMB.

Ron Trainer, the hottest of the elite corps of Computer Master Debuggers is enjoying his first week of vacation in over two years. He's been busy keeping CPI running errorfree. CPI, the Central Programing Institute, is what allows the world to exist the way it does. It controls everything; from global databases and grids to holographic theater software as well as the simple timing of the traffic signals. But something is terribly wrong tonight... cities around the globe have lost their power and data feeds. There have been several major aerial collisions between passenger liners and heavy freighters and the skyways have been closed until global traffic control is back on-line. All power and light have been lost and the atmospheric control system can only continue to function on auxiliary power for the verge of collapse. There is rioting reported in several areas. What's going on??? This appears to be more than a simple system's bug... but how much more?

The egg-shaped protagonist was set to appear in a NES sequel and work began on Mystery World Dizzy in 1993, which was essentially a remake of the Fantasy World Dizzy game which appeared on home computers. However, financial difficulties at the time scuppered those plans.

Fast forward to 2017 and Dizzy creators Phillip and Andrew Oliver (otherwise known as The Olivier Twins) have released the game.

    <desc>Well, if you're into RPGs with a lot of plot, you might want to stay away from this game. There's a menu at the beginning, and you can choose from 50 scenarios. When you choose, you go right into battle. It's that simple. No messy plot to clutter things up or anything like that. It's too bad, a plot would really be handy, because maybe it would actually explain things a little. The game's kind of easy at first, but that's because you can just use the LONG skill and hit the Emperor twice and then kill him. Then you win. Pretty simple eh? Well I don't much like strategy RPGs anyway, so I admit I didn't give this game very much of a chance. Sorry.

Translation Description:

Due to this game having zero storyline, translating this game was probably very easy. I mean, all you have are menus and stats, right? Well there you go. Anyway, it's complete, so have fun with it.

PROJECT NARC

Dear Sirs,

As you may well know, our position in the war on drugs has gotten worse. Much worse.

The N.O. has currently identified several groups of known offenders. Dealers, pushers, mobsters, gangsters--even psycho clowns--they're all in on it.

They seem to have an unlimited supply of weapons. Government reports claim that the entire operation is being directed and financed by a Mr. Big--who, it seems, runs the largest underground drug trafficking and terrorist organization in the world.

We'd send in the army's special operations division, but that would just send up flags. We need to act more covertly. Which is why you two have been chosen to go in there and spearhead this operation.

You will have to cover a lot of territory. Mr. Big's people are everywhere! What's more, the action doesn't stop at the street. You'll catch them down in their underground drug labs (destroy as much of that poison as you can) and up in the top floors of classy, highrise hotels.

We'll supply you with machine gun ammo and all the rocket bombs you can carry. But you'll probably go through them fast. So replenish your supply with the stuff dropped on the street.

And speaking of the street, pick up anything and everything you can. Cash...Contraband...Even magnetic entry cards--they'll open doors for you.

Keep in touch with us via your Mobile Scanner Unit. We'll give you progress reports as well as updates on your assignment.

N.O. and the entire country are counting on you. Good Luck.

Spencer Williams
N.O. Chairman

--From the NES Narc instruction manual.

Overview:

Earning your way through training, you have become one of the DEA's top narcs. Shortly after the promotion, you get a call from headquarters reminding that there is a drug bust occuring near downtown. Your goal is to stop the dealers before everyone in the city becomes addicted to their highly dangerous drug. Good luck! In the game, you shoot and bust the bad guys and get to the next level. Unfortunately, some have to be shot. Your weapons include an Uzi and a rocket launcher. To complete the level, you have to get the safe cards and insert them near the exit. I think that they did a decent job on this game, but there are some problems. If you want to shoot the gun, you have to hold down the B button, while just pressing it will shoot rockets. A lot of the backgrounds have changed from the arcade version. Because of this, I prefer the arcade version over the NES version. Remember, say no to drugs!

Directions:

Shoot and bust all the drug dealers and other criminals in the city before it's too late. 

Controls:

A Button: Hold for gun, press for rockets
B Button: Press to jump, hold to duck
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Continue Game
Hold A+B+Select+Start and press Up-Right.

    <name>NES Open Tournament Golf</name>
    <path/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
NES Open is a pretty fun golf game. The graphics look very good for one of the early eight-bit systems. The sounds are pleasant and there isn't a whole lot of distracting background music. The controls were easy to learn, but they seemed a little slow. It's very hard to get the swing meter to stop where you want it to.

The gameplay has several variations that give it good variety. There are also a lot of little details that made the gameplay feel like playing golf for real. If you like golf games, this is good for killing a few hours.

Directions:

Choose one or two players. The first player will always be Mario, and if there is a second player, he will be Luigi. You can play golf in stroke play, match play, or tournament play.

Stroke play just counts your strokes and you try to get the least amount you can, and can be played in two player mode. Match play can be played against Luigi or a few others, or in two player mode. Match play is played hole-by-hole, either someone wins the hole and is awarded a point, or it's a tie and you move on to the next hole. The person with the most points at the end wins. Tournament play is played against several golfers in stroke play, and is only available to one player mode. At the end of 18 or 36 holes, the person with the fewest strokes wins.

While playing, you first must decide where you want your golfer to aim. Decide this based on the direction of the wind, and where you want the ball to land on the fairway. Then, you must decide which club to use. Use the club that has a max distance close to the distance you want to hit the ball. Next you will have to decide where you want to make contact with the ball. If you make contact with the bottom of the ball, the ball will have a higher trajectory and have backspin on it when it lands. If you make contact with the top of the ball, it will have a lower trajectory and have topspin on it.

After that, it will be time to actually swing. Push the button to start the meter, again to stop it for power, and again to stop it for accuracy. Stopping it all the way on the left will ensure maximum power. Stopping the meter right back on the line where it started will ensure accuracy. Stopping it early off the line will cause a slice, while late will cause a hooked shot. While putting, you will not have to stop the meter the second time, you just have to stop it once for power.

There are three courses to choose from, but none of them are based on real courses, they were just made up for the game. 

Controls:

A Button: OK
B Button: Cancel
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: None

Hints:

Spin
Always be sure to use backspin when approaching the green so your ball will stop on a dime. Be sure to use topspin on the drive so you can get all the distance possible out of your drives.

This game was highly impressive for its time. It allowed players to choose from eight real teams from various cities, and each team featured all the actual players that were currently playing for them. The teams were: Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Rams, Miami Dolphins, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins.

The game used an isometric view, presenting the game at an angle to make it appear 3-D, and the game allowed a very large number of moving objects (all the players) to be on screen at the same time; in earlier games, the system couldn't handle it. In a typical NES game, few moving objects could be onscreen before they all started flashing, because the system couldn't render them all at once, but NES PAF managed to avoid this somehow and allow the system to render two entire football teams onscreen simultaneously.

Another feature that was ahead of its time was the use of real voices. NES PAF was one of an extremely small number of NES games to feature voices. Most games never bothered to implement this feature because of the primitive sound capabilities, but in NES PAF, players hear the referee say in a real voice "Touchdown!" or "First down!" You can even hear the football players yell "Ready! Set! Hut, hut.." before the play begins. At the end of each game, Nester appears as a commentator, announcing who wins and who lost.

New Ghostbusters II follows loosely the original Ivan Reitman's film plot. You start out by selecting two ghostbusters out of five (The 5th one is Louis Tully). The first, player controlled buster will use proton pack and second, controlled by AI, uses the trap where ghosts end up, after been freezed by using the proton pack. Player controlled buster can get hurt, if touched by a ghost, while AI buster can't.

The game's perspective is Top-Down, where you move from a one room to another and get rid of ghosts. The type of ghosts vary. After every level you have to fight against a boss, usually someone from the movie. For example, in the first courthouse level you fight against the Scoleri brothers.

The levels are still the same great ones developed by ACMLM and with the same modifications to the gameplay, this game ought to keep bringing people back for more and more.

A Bookworm With A Secret

Mark Gray is an encyclopedia researcher for Global Encyclopedia, Inc., the Metro City based publishers of one of the all-time best-selling reference guides available. His passion for social and criminal history is surpassed only by his passion for adventure. This fixation guided him to the development of a crime-fighting alter-ego. Mark Gray sheds his bookish day-job persona, dons a trench coat, fedora and shades and steals into the dusk as the advent- urous crime fighter: Nightshade!

From Darkness Comes Nightshade

Mark Gray followed Vortex's actions and escapades for years. He knew everything about the hero, except his identity and hideout. Gray believed that Vortex made a grave error by underestimating Sutekh. After the cataclysmic battle between the two, Mark vowed to avenge his defeated idol, Vortex.

Mark slips into his trench coat, fedora and shades to protect his identity. With his exceptional physical training and keen intellect as his only weapons he sets out to continue Vortex's goal of a crime-free Metro City. He patrolled the inner city neighborhoods, gathering information, searching for weapons left behind by Vortex, and, when necessary, apprehending would-be muggers, drug dealers and thieves. His street brawls led to confrontations with Sutekh's minions: mummies and jackals, King Rat, Goliath and his thugs, and the League of Unreasonable Gentlemen, to name a few. Television and newspaper reports carried stories of the new, mysterous crime-fighter in Metro City, and the Nightshade legend was born!

In the Claws of Sutekh

It wasn't long before Sutekh and Nightshade crossed paths. The evil lunatic had his men ambush Nightshade, and prepared to remove the last obstacle between himself and total control of Metro City. Even now, Nightshade lies bound some- where under the city, facing certain death. Can he escape a tragic end, or has Metro City's newest crime fighter met his match?

Now is your chance to face off against the power of Sutekh. With over 100 screens to search, you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for clues to the where- abouts of the evil Sutekh. Be aware of your surroundings and stay sharp - you never know what fiendishness lurks behind the corner!

    <desc>With a game so simple, there's not much to be said about it. You just run around and kill people with your ninja stars, and you can get a boomerang later on. You can probably get more than that, but I can't be too sure. Other than the really crappy control, Ninja Boy 2 is a really fun game. All the first one had was a bunch of vertically scrolling levels I think. The sequel tries to add a platforming aspect, and it doesn't really work. Basically, it just ends up being you and the enemy hurling shurikens as fast as you can at each other until someone slips up. Usually you. Still, cool game. Old, and quickly tiresome, but still pretty cool.

Translation Description:

I think all Toma needed to translate were a couple sentences. But those sentences were translated marvellously, let me tell YOU!

A ninja-oriented combat game in the vein of Ninja Gaiden... More and Shinobi, Ninja Crusaders is a standard entry in the genre that's noteworthy for its two-player simultaneous play and the main characters' ability to transform into a tiger, eagle, dragon or scorpion by holding down the A button.

The graphics are about average for an NES game of the period, adequately depicting the enemies, scenery and ninja transformations without really drawing attention to themselves. Yet whatever potential the game may have had is ruined by its one-hit deaths, making Ninja Crusaders a title only for restless NES players looking for a challenge. ~ Skyler Miller, All Game Guide

The tale of the Dragon Sword

Long before the civilization of mankind, extremely fierce yet primitive life forms roamed the earth and battled for supremacy. Thousands of years ago, the final battle took place. One side, after using all its strength, perished while the other was sent to and sealed off in a different dimension. The tale of this battle was preserved in legend after mankind began to populate the earth and the two forces, known respectively as the gods of the Dragon and the demons of Darkness, came to be revered by certain clans among the people.

By the summer of AD 1988, even this ancient great tale had almost been completely forgotten. However, one very evil being appeared and, with the help of his followers, began to build an Empire of Darkness. That being was Jaquio- a member of the Demon clan who plotted to bring the demons of Darkness back to the earth. He secretly schemed to steal and bring together, for the first time in aeons, the two "Statues of Light and Darkness" said to contain great magical power. This would open the passageway between the dimensions.

There was, however, one man who would stop at nothing to foil Jaquio's evil plans - head of the Dragon clan, Ken Hayabusa. After entrusting the Dragon Sword, an heirloom of the family and clan so old that no one knew when it had been made, to his son Ryu, Ken left for the fateful battle. Unfortunately, Ken was defeated by a powerful warrior and the Statue he was protecting fell into the hands of Jaquio.

After hearing of his father's death, Ryu took the Dragon Sword and went to America. Aided by a female CIA spy, Irene, Ryu stealthily infiltrated Jaquio's secret hideout.

The inevitable duel between them ended in victory for Ryu. Jaquio was vanquished along with his Empire of Darkness. Or so it seemed....

Watching this duel from afar was the real evil, the head of the Demon clan, the Evil Lord himself, Ashtar. As it turned out, Jaquio was nothing more than a pawn of this greater power.

Ashtar hid himself in the darkness, assessing his enemy. His eyes shined and he licked his lips. He had only to wait for his enemy.

A year passed.

While pursuing her investigation into the movements of the mysterious Ashtar, Irene suddenly disappeared. A super-secret CIA special force platoon then became pinned down in front of some old ruins that were believed to house Ashtar's headquarters. The situation looked desperate.

At this point, Ashtar, who himself had actually seen the birth of the Dragon Sword and knew of its potentially awesome powers, emerged again from the depths of his dark realm. Ryu, who knew nothing of all this, was in grave danger as Ashtar worked his black magic to destroy him.

And now, the saga continues with the final tale of battle for our brave hero. After Ryu's victorious duel with Jaquio, Ashtar returned to the bowels of darkness and bided His time. But another evil creature was already on its way as another adventure awaits the unsuspecting Ryu Hayabusa...

... in this, the final chapter of Ninja Gaiden.

In order to avenge his father's death, Ryu had come to America, where he was suddenly attacked by a mysterious army. After escaping from a narrow brush with death, Ryu came face to face with a mysterious woman. Fire came shooting out of the shining gun in her hand, and suddenly everything in front on Ryu began to grow hazy. Waking up in an underground dungeon, Ryu was handed a strange statue by the same woman, who told him to take it and make his escape. Without fully understanding what was going on around him, Ryu took the statue and made his way out of the enemy territory.

Ryu then went to see Dr. Smith, an archaeologist friend of his father, and learned about the light and dark statues of an evil demon. Just as they were talking, the dark statue was snatched away by an enemy ninja.

"Ryu, go after him!"

After retrieving the statue, he returned to Dr. Smith's cabin only to find the doctor lying on the floor, mortally wounded. Just before he died, the doctor whispered, "Ryu, now the light statue has been taken..." When Ryu looked up from Dr. Smith's side he found that he was surrounded by a band of men dressed in black from head to foot. They were all pointing their guns at him. These men took Ryu to a secret CIA base and to the office of Chief Foster.

Foster explained to Ryu that the mysterious woman, Irene, was really a spy for the CIA, and told him about Jaquio's plans and about his Temple of Darkness. Foster then forced Ryu to take on the perilous mission of recovering the stolen light statue of the evil demon.

Ryu made his way toward the Temple of Darkness located deep in the Amazon jungle. But Jaquio, who was holding Irene hostage in the temple, blackmailed Ryu into giving up the dark statue of the demon that he had been carrying and dumped Ryu down into an underground cave. Ryu was finally able to escape from the cave, but as he climbed over the last cliff, he came face to face with the villain who had killer his father, Bloody Malth. Malth had been waiting for him. Ryu and Malth duelled to the death. With his last breath, Malth gave Ryu some unexpected news: "Your father is alive." A masked demon was waiting inside the shrine to fight off Ryu's attack. Ryu shouted, "Nobody can beat me!" But the eerie voice of Jaquio thundered the question, "Not even your own father?" The masked demon was really Ryu's father Ken who had been put under some kind of trance. Finally freed from Jaquio's evil control, Ken came to his senses only to find that Jaquio was about to kill Ryu.

Ken threw himself in front of Ryu, and acted as a shield to protect his son from the balls of fire. Realizing what had happened, Ryu went mad with rage and charged at Jaquio.

After defeating Jaquio, Ryu rushed back to his father's side. His father instructed him to take the light and dark statues of the evil demon out of the temple. But just as Ken was gasping this message to his son, the moon began to grow in the darkness. The moon, blackened by the earth's shadow, was beginning to bring the evil demon back to life. But the evil demon was finally defeated, and the temple crumbled upon itself with a deafening roar. Ryu and Irene looked out upon the ruins of the temple. The morning sun shone down upon them and cleared up the deep sense of darkness and evil that had once hovered in the air.

A year has passed, and still the activity down at the bottom of the realm of darkness continues. Ashtar, the evil lord who secretly controls Jaquio, is now on the move.

--From the NES Ninja Gaiden 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

Ninja Gaiden II was a very fun game. The ability to stick to the walls and climb up them was genius. The only thing I didn't really like was that some of the special weapons were really hard to use effectively. The graphics for this game were really good. The bad guys were easily recognizable. The backgrounds looked pretty real too. 

Directions:

Use your ninja skills to save the world from Ashtar. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Pause
Up+B: Use Power

Hints:

The wind howls as the two "Dueling" Ninjas glare at each other in the moonlight. Though these men seem like little more than shadows in the air, the moonlight reveals just for an instant, a glint of light that proves to be the end of the contest. Ken, head of the Hayabusa clan which has for generations been the guardian of the Dragon sword, is defeated.

Ken's son Ryu, after learning of his father's defeat, finds a letter. In it Ryu is told that if his father does not return, he must take the secret Dragon sword and go to America. Ryu senses danger awaiting him in America. What will be the fate of Ninja Ryu!?

--From the NES Ninja Gaiden instruction manual.

Overview:

Ninja Gaiden is the first installment in a long and illustrious series. This game was super-popular in the arcade, and this is a pretty nice port. The graphics aren't as good as they were in the arcade, but the game-play is about the same. Ninja Gaiden was one of those games that would sell a bunch of copies just because it had the word 'ninja' in the title. It was still a great game, though. Cross classic side-scrolling platform with cool ninja magic and abilities, and you've got yourself a fun game. If you haven't played Ninja Gaiden, give it a try. 

Directions:

Everybody is Kung Fu fighting! Use your ninja skills to clear the levels. Ryu can grab onto and jump from walls, so if you are falling there is still hope!

Slash open objects to get power-ups, which you can use with Up-B. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Pause
Up+B: Use Power

Hints:

Sound Test
During the 'Tecmo Presents 1989' screen, hold Left, Down, Select, A, B and press Start.

    <desc>This game is obscenely like Super Mario Bros. 3. The graphics are similar, the onscreen display is similar. And of course, you fill enemies by jumping on them. Hell, you even jump into blocks for power-ups. The only thing they're missing is question marks on the blocks and a racoon tail.

That's not to say this is a bad game. It's actually quite fun. And there are differences! For one, the way dashing works is a lot more engaging than SMB. You can't just dash, otherwise you'll start somersaulting. You gotta dash, then let go before you jump! Yeah, you're right. It's more aggravating than the Mario way, but it still different!

Incidentally, I found out through playing this how poor I am at 2D platform games now. Once upon a time, I was really good! Now I'm used to all this new-fangled 3D stuff. So I died a lot. Your mileage may vary.

Translation Description:

Well, this is a platformer that isn't text-laden. But a stupendous job was done of the text that was present, thanks to HTI. Not much more to comment on, so just go get the patch already and try it.

Ninja JaJaMaru-kun (meaning 'determined little ninja') was originally released for the Japanese Famicom (NES) in Japan in 1985. This action game features a ninja called JaJaMaru, who uses his shuriken (ninja throwing stars) to defeat monsters and save Princess Sakura from the evil Lord Namazu Dayuu.

Use special items to aid your quest (including a giant frog that you can ride!) as you fight across multiple stages filled with uniquely Japanese ghosts and monsters.

    <desc>NOTE: Only works in NestopiaX

I guess in a sense, this game is like Zelda, but with ninjas instead and a yoyo for a weapon instead of a sword. So some hellish monk decides to resurrect some great, big and evil demon and you're charged with the task of defeating them/it. Overall I'd say the game is pretty good with good music and a good story. I suppose the dungeon design was pretty uninspired as they kind of seemed the same, but it's not a big deal.

Translation Description

After a few months of work, aishsha and I have complete transaltion patch for Jajamaru Gekimaden. We have translated the title as Ninja Jajamaru: Legend of the Demon's Attack ~Castle of Dreams~ Hopefully the patch should be without issues.

For the competition, 116 special game cartridges were manufactured. 90 of these copies exist in a grey cartridge and were given out to semi-finalists of the 1990 NWC. 26 of these cartridges are gold - like the Legend of Zelda cartridge - and were given out to winners and runners-up in a contest held by Nintendo Power magazine.

To play the cartridge, one must have a controller connected to both controller ports and press start on the second player's controller. For the competition, there was a special switch that would start all cartridges simultaneously.

Both versions of the cartridge feature DIP switches on the front, which can alter the time limit.

The Nintendo World Championships 1990 game cartridge is considered to be the rarest and most valuable NES cartridge released, promo cartridges aside,[1] and the gold variation is nicknamed the holy grail of video game collecting[2]. Recently, a grey cartridge went on eBay and sold for a record $6,100. In June 2009 a collector paid $17,500 for NWC Gold in a private transaction.

On April 17th, 2007, a gold cartridge was inadvertently sold by a father who was selling his son's possessions who had died in Iraq on myebid.com. The father was selling 24 cartridges, with no special attention paid to the Nintendo World Championships 1990 cartridge. The listing ended at $21,400[1], though it is unlikely that this amount was actually paid. Collectors have speculated that this listing was not legitimate to begin with, and that the bids may also not have been legitimate.

To date, of the 26 NWC gold cartridges produced, only 12 copies have ever surfaced. The last copy sold in June 2009 for $17,500 to a collector in Colorado[6]. The NWC Gold cartridge is often compared to "holy grail" items from other collectible hobbies, such as the T206 Honus Wagner baseball card, Inverted Jenny postage stamp or Action Comics #1 comic book. Reproductions of the game cartridge, with the DIP switches, can be purchased from RetroZone for $55.

Games:

Officially, a player has 6 minutes and 21 seconds to play in the contest, which is divided up into three minigames. The first minigame of the competition is to collect 50 coins in Super Mario Brothers. The next minigame is a version of Rad Racer where players must complete a specialized Nintendo World Championship course. The final minigame is Tetris and this lasts until time expires. Once time does expire, a player's score is totaled using the following formula:

    Super Mario Bros. score
    + Rad Racer score times 10
    + Tetris score times 25

Most players focused their tactic on getting a high score in Tetris while other players tried to exploit a trick in Super Mario Brothers where a part of the game can be played repeatedly using warp pipes.

The first two games were modified so that a player could not get a "game over." In Super Mario Bros., the player was given 99 lives, and in Rad Racer, the in-game timer was permanently fixed at 99 seconds. But in Tetris, placing a block over the top of the playing field would effectively end the game prematurely, and the player could not start again -- the game would freeze at the "game over" screen until the 6:21 competition time ran out.

Pressing the RESET button during either Rad Racer or Tetris would take you to the point add up.

Competition structure:

The Nintendo World Championships consisted of eight rounds, all separated into the three age groups. Contestants entered by going to one of 30 local competitions, which were held at the 1990 Nintendo PowerFest. On the first two days of the PowerFest, contestants would play in groups of up to 50 at a time, and the top seven scorers were brought onto a main stage to compete against each other. Contestants could re-enter the first round as many times as they wished.

Each second round winner was invited back to the last day of the PowerFest at that location. All the players in each age group played a third round, and again the top seven scorers were brought on-stage to compete in a fourth round. The top two scorers in the fourth round then competed head-to-head for the title of local competition winner in their age group. There were 90 finalists, 30 in each age group. Each finalist won a trophy, some other relatively small prizes, and a trip for two to Hollywood for the main Nintendo World Championships event.

The Championships were held at Universal Studios. Each age group's finalists competed simultaneously in the sixth round, and the top seven scorers were brought on stage for the seventh round. Finally, the top two scorers in the seventh round competed head-to-head for the title of Nintendo World Champion for their age group.

Results:

There were three age categories in the competition: 11 and under, 12-17, and 18 and older. Jeff Hansen won in the 11 and under category, Thor Aackerlund won in the 12-17 category, and Robert Whiteman won in the 18 and older category. Below is a full listing of the ninety finalists from each city for each age category.

    <desc>This hack allows any of the thirteen teams in the game to be used in VS Match Mode with the proper graphics and statistics. In order to accomplish this, it expands the CHR-ROM portion of the ROM file to create space for the graphics of the team combinations not originally present. It replaces the team select screen from VS Match Mode with the one from Tournament Mode. It also changes the palette used when both players select the same team so that the second team does not use the palette of England. This is done for clarity in case both players elect to play as England.

Noah has been commanded by God to put two of each animal aboard his ark to save them from the flood. However unhappy people from around the world have captured different animal species, preventing Noah from doing his job. Noah will need to visit these different locations and free the animals from the people holding them captive.

Noah's Ark is a side scrolling action game. The player, as Noah, must choose which level from several world locations to play. Once in a level, Noah can move left right, duck, jump and fire pellets directly in front of him. These pellets can be used to defeat enemy creatures and uncover hidden items. At the end of each level, Noah will encounter a stronger enemy creature who must be defeated. Noah's ultimate goal is to rescue the designated captive animals listed for each level.

The player's goal is to repeat the feat of Oda Nobunaga, the unification of Japan under one flag, whether by playing Oda Nobunaga or any of the other daimyos present.

In each scenario, the player has to allocate resources to raise a strong army for both defense and attack, build a productive economy to support town and army growth, and maintain the happiness of the peasants. The whole game is played in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. Battles are decided by either forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying their command unit, or by prolonging the battle until they run out of supplies.

The game deals with the Sengoku period of the history of Japan. The player's goal is to repeat the feat of Oda Nobunaga, the unification of Japan under one flag, whether by playing Oda Nobunaga or any of the other daimyos present. The game has four pre-made scenarios: Battle for the East (starts 1560), Daimyo power struggles (1560), Ambition untamed (1571) and Road towards unification (1582).

In each scenario, the player has to allocate resources to raise a strong army for both defense and attack, build a productive economy to support town and army growth, and maintain the happiness of the peasants. The whole game is played in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. Battles are decided by either forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying their command unit, or by prolonging the battle until they run out of supplies.

Overview:

Taking an extremely simplified board interface, the game features a strategic map of the USA separated into states and territories, where army units are moved around. In each state which "owns" a railway station, there is a fort, the capture of which leads to the player overtaking the whole state. Otherwise, capturing a state involves simple movement, unless there is another army "on" the state.

Armies can be reinforced in two ways. By turning on an option at the main menu the player controlling the state of North Carolina will get periodic reinforcements by ship. Also, railways generate money which in turn generate soldiers. Moving their army units, the player may expand westwards into unoccupied territory. If two antagonistic armies clash, it will result in a battle.

There is an option on the main menu where the player can turn off in-game missions and battles to make it purely like a board game. Whenever opposing armies meet in board-game mode, the results of the battles are randomised, although the side with the largest army is more likely to win and either army may retreat from the battle. Whenever a side attempts to capture an enemy fort or rob a train, the result is also randomised, sometimes they are successful, sometimes they are not.

In this Arcade game the gameplay is quite simple, the hero, named "Milk" must get all the fruits in the screen in order to free his girlfriend (don't ask me what's the relation) who is captured inside of a house. Your rival "'Nuts" will try to keep you away from your goal. To obtain the fruit, Milk will climb up ladders and jump onto different platforms.

Points are earned by obtaining the fruit, jumping over Nuts and completing the level in the shortest amount of time (obtaining the Bonus score value). Two game modes are included as well as a level editor.

This game was pretty fun and slightly addicting. I liked how they made it where people without the zapper could still play this shooter. The game also actually kept track of how accurate you were and how many bullets you wasted, and based on that, gave you a score that was delivered by the president. It also took points away from your score if you shot any of the good guys. The graphics in Operation Wolf were very good. I especially liked the helicopters. There were lots of enemies like, tanks, helicopters, men, and sometimes vultures. I never really understood the vultures. I know you could shoot them but I'm not sure what the point value was. Operation Wolf was a lot of fun and I suggest you give it a try.

Directions:

Infiltrate and defeat the enemy army. 

Controls:

A Button: Fires Machine Gun
B Button: Launches Grenade
Start ButtonL: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select Crosshair Speed

Hints:

Grenades
Be sure not to use grenades around civilians, if they get hurt so will you.

Your mission

You are an Explorer First Class, on assignment in a remote corner of the uni- verse. Space stations, Colonial Cruisers and whole solar systems have myst- eriously disappeared in this region. A nearby planet is buzzing with rumors of an evil space wizard, Krohn. He controls an enormous Black hole which has already begun to double in size.

Your ship, the Millennium Orb, is the only space craft capable of withstanding the energy forces of Krohn's Black Hole. There are 30 Enigma Chambers separat- ing you from Krohn. Each chamber will test your wits, skill, cunning and courage. You must keep the Millennium Orb in position by manipulating force shields at the top and bottom of each chamber in Krohn's domain. You must keep within the plane and deal with the dangers hurled at you by the malicious wizard.

As you bounce off the force shields in each chamber, you will notice your Orb travels on an orbital path around the center plane of each chamber. You can alter this path by diving into and out of the center plane. You can also put some "English" on your Orb by cleverly moving your force shields. Use these techniques to hit the targets in each Enigma Chamber.

As you conquer each chamber, you encounter a staggering diversity of targets and puzzles, the inventions of Krohn's twisted sense of humor. You find your- self battling Eye Spy, Balloonacy, Roamin' Numerals and the Cheshire Cat, not to mention other wily opponents. Remember, keep within the force shields, conserve fuel and complete all the chambers. You MUST defeat Krohn.

Refuel at Vern's Orb-O-Rama when necessary. Vern and his service station/ restaurant are, like yourself, now trapped in the vacuum of the Black Hole. Once at Vern's, navigate your Orb through as many fuel bays as possible to fuel up. Note that Vern's has a strong gravitational pull - your force shields are unnecessary here. Steer your Orb and dive from the front and rear of Vern's Orb-O-Rama to fuel up.

Although his life depends on the success of your mission, Vern is still a businessman, and prefers payments in credits. You gather these credits by solving Enigma Chambers. If you're low on credits, you'll notice Vern's fuel bays are closed when you arrive. You can obtain credit by hitting the "$" icon on the right side of Vern's. You must pay for credit immediately with your next 1000 points. If you haven't paid for your fuel, the next time you go to Vern's you'll be out of luck.

Other creatures may hamper your Orb's progress. In particular, be aware of "Chasers". These space pirates save gas money by chasing down hard-working, interstellar travelers like yourself and robbing their fuel tanks. Chasers can also hit targets on the center plane... be careful, this may do you more harm than good.

One last word of caution... Remember to navigate Krohn's corridors courageous- ly, conserve fuel and refuel wisely, battle the wizard's evil brood and, finally, defeat Krohn. The fate of the entire Universe is in your hands.

--From the NES Orb 3-D instruction manual.

Hints: 

Use a pair of 3D glasses to enhance the experience.

    <desc>
Othello is touted as the game that takes "A Minute to Learn, A Lifetime to Master". It is a two-player board game played on a board with 64 squares using discs colored black on one side and white on the other. As in checkers, the players are represented by the colors of the disc. The objective is to trap your opponent's discs and convert them to your color. Whoever has the most discs at the end of the game wins.

Othello is an addictive game like Tetris. The graphics are not comparable to modern games (the discs are flat and crude looking circles), but who cares, the fun is trying to beat your opponent, not watching special effects.

Directions:

Press Start to begin the game and choose the options that you desire. The game starts with two black discs and two white discs in the center of the board. To place a disc on the board use the Control Pad to move the hand to the square that you have chosen and then press the "A" button.

If you are not trapping your opponent's discs, you will be advised to "Try Again".     Players alternate placing discs on the board, trapping the opponent's discs which allows the disc to be flipped to expose the color of the "trapping" player. Trapping is accomplished by placing a disc such that it "traps" your opponent's discs (either in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line) between two of your discs. The opponent's discs are then flipped to expose your color. You must "pass" play to your opponent if you cannot place a disc that will trap your opponent. The game ends when the time expires or neither player can make a trapping move. Depending upon the level that you choose , you may be able to cancel a move. To cancel a move simply press the "B" button when it becomes your turn again. Supposedly, if you wait when the game begins, there will be demonstration games displayed.

Skill Levels
     1  Player may cancel as many moves as desired
     2  Player may cancel only three moves per game
     3  Player may cancel only three moves per game
     4  No move canceling allowed

Controls:

A Button: Place Disc
B Button: Cancel Moves
Start Button: Starts Game

Hints:

Disc Placement
Try to place your discs on the edge of the board, and try to capture a corner of the board.

Over Horizon is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player has to guide a spaceship through various levels and destroy numerous enemies. The ship's weapons can be fired in tow directions and defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that equip the ship with different weapons and up to two options. There are three different weapons in addition to the standard shot: Laser, homing missiles and bombs.

The "Edit Mode" presents an unusual feature. In it, players can determine the options positions (which can be changed by pressing the A and B button simultaneously), as well as the properties of the weapons. It is, for example, possible to have the laser behave like homing missiles or the homing missiles like bombs.

Go to up to four different galaxies, fight evil aliens in their spaceships, and eventually conquer their starbase so that the humans can colonize the entire universe.

This game is similar to SimEarth except currency is used instead of natural planet energy and wars are manually controlled by the player, instead of being waged out automatically by the CPU. The more advanced the galaxy is and the harder the warlord is, the more freedom the player receives in purchasing spaceships. Also, a player must watch the energy and food usage of his colonists (because a growing population means more tax dollars that can be re-routed to headquarters).

    <desc>Paaman (or quite possibly Parman) is a comic in Japan which is done by the same guy who did Doraemon. Like that wasn't already obvious just by looking at 'em. All of the four characters that you have the choice of controlling have the amazing ability to fly in an amazingly awkward fashion. I don't think there's any difference in who you want to pick though. What's awkward about flying is, if you're flying Up and want to go Left, you don't just automatically go Left when you hit the control pad... you go diagonally, then you go left. And you don't sit still if you let go of the control pad, you have to hit A to stop. And then you have to hit A again to fall to the ground and walk around like normal. Which is all very weird. But you can jump REALLY high, so that's cool.

Translation Description:

Well there doesn't look like there's much text in the game (aside from the usual crazy prologue), but it all looks very very nice. And it's finished!

Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss.

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

    <desc>Pac-Man III is an inventive hack of the NES version of Ms. Pac-Man that adds new boards, new colors, new features, and new eyeballs.

Yes, new eyeballs. Ms. Pac-Man has appropriately been changed to Mr. Pac-Man for this hack, but for some reason DahrkDaiz, in his ceaseless quest for NES graphical enhancement perfection, decided to give Pac-Man bulging white eyeballs (if you'll recall, Pac-Man was originally eyeless in the first Pac-Man). After playing this game for about thirty minutes, those disturbingly googly eyes have a startling way of being permanently etched into your brain.

Nightmares aside, this is a really fun hack. DahrkDaiz designed 32 new levels for a wide-eyed Pac-Man to chomp his way through. Some of them are on the traditional side of things (ho-hum square-ish), while some are quite devious (invisible walls!). Never one to just modify a few tiles and walk away, DD had to provide a completely new feature or two. In this case, he provided a new way to play the levels: on the title screen, you can select either "Linear" play, which takes you through the boards in sequential order, or "Random" play, in which (surprise!) you play the boards in a random order. DD also added a pellet counter in the upper-right portion of the screen which keeps track of how many pellets you have left to eat before completing the board.

This is one of Tengen's few licensed games, before they cracked Nintendo's protection and made games as they wished.

Pac-Man is a primal video game that is all about trade-offs. Every possible move has good and bad qualities. Eat pellets to complete the level, but you slow down and a ghost might catch you. Grab a power pellet and eat ghosts, you are not completing the level and the ghosts could turn while you are hunting them. Greedy for the fruit? Pac-Man has you making decisions at every turn in less than a second. Wakka-wakka indeed.

Directions:

Navigate Pac-Man through the maze and eat all the pellets. Avoid the ghosts moving about the maze unless you've eaten a big Power Pellet that turns them dark blue. Grab the fruit that appears occasionally for extra points.

Controls:

A Button: Nothing
B Button: Nothing
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Select one or two player game

Hints:

Ghost Behavior
Blinkey(Red)-
Blinkey is the most aggressive of the ghosts. He'll follow you around corners and stay on your tail like no other. He speeds up at you eat more pellets.

Pinky(Pink)-
Pinky leads the pack in and out of scatter mode. She's the first to chase you and the first to back away. She runs around corners counter-clockwise(Working with clockwise circling Blinky and Clyde to trap you).

Inky(Blue)-
Unpredictable.

Clyde(Orange)-
Clyde is often aloof from the group. He's the worst at following Pac-Man. Don't waste your time hunting him if you got a power pellet, as his job seems to be distraction.

Palamedes is a simplistic Tetris-like game for the NES and Game Boy game systems requiring the player to match the dice they are holding to the dice on top of the screen. Using the "B" button, the player can change the number on his dice, then throw the dice using the "A" button when it matches the dice at the top of the screen, which wipes the target dice off the screen.

The player can play in "solitaire" mode against the computer or another player, or "tournament" mode against CPU opponents. There are 6 sides and numbers on the dice, making an attempt to match all the numbers on the screen and eliminating them a challenge.

You've managed to get yourself a job delivering newspapers for the Daily Sun. You have to get papers to all your subscribers without running out, and hopefully without breaking their windows. If you fail, you'll end up looking in the Sun for a new job. If you do well, you could end up in the paper for your amazing accomplishments!

Paberboy 2 includes more houses, more obstacles, more enemies, and a lot more options! You can use your expert aim not only to deliver the news, but also to make the neighborhood a better place to live. So grab your bike, warm up the old throwing arm, and get out there!

The paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed: faster delivery earns a higher score. But the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended.

The primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers. Keeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a closed window.

Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day.

    <desc>Parallel World is a surprisingly good, if not particularly original, puzzle game. When I first looked at gameplay screenshots, I admit that I didn't think much of it, but now that I've actually tried it, I've been pleasantly surprised.

The game stars two children who witness the sky break open and are drawn into the void and, thus, a parallel world. They see some sort of strange castle and feel compelled to explore it. Or something. That's what I got out of the game's introduction, anyway.

Speaking of, the intro is actually rather pretty. Colors are used well, the characters are animated competently, and the hole breaking open in the sky is a fairly neat effect. That said, the actual levels in the game, which are very much tile-based, feel much more cluttered than they actually are. This is probably in part due to the dancing thingies that border the level, and in part due to the checkerboard pattern of the floor. It creates a lot of visual noise which, personally, I could have done without.

The game itself is fairly standard puzzle fare. Your objective is twofold - first, you need to push the path-patterned pillars into enemies to crush them. One of them will be carrying a key that will unlock the door to the next area. Second, once the door is open, you need to manipulate the pillars with paths drawn on them to let you reach the exit. You do this by pushing them around and rotating them to create a single steady line from an immovable white pillar to the exit door. It gets difficult pretty quickly.

Translation Description:

All that needed doing, apparently, was the title screen and credits, but they're done, so booyah!

This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms.

The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.

    <desc>The whole premise of the game is to choose an spot on the board where you don't want a peg to be, then jump pegs, one over the other, until there is one peg left on the board, or there are no more moves to make. It's a rather simple game, but it's pretty fun! If you're not sure exactly what game I'm talking about, go to your local Cracker Barrel and you'll know what I'm talking about.

I developed this game for the Garage Cart 2 release being published by Memblers. Go here for more informationNESDev Forum on that. Besides that, I am offering the game up as a free download, with source included. There is label art created by my buddy Kevin, also. He did an outstanding job on it, so if you end up making your own cart of Pegs, I highly recommend the label he made for it!

What I've been doing, in terms of development, is learning little things at a time, then basing a program around those things. For instance, I had never done alot of bitwise operations before, so I did alot of that with this game. I had also figured out how to do an 8-bit RLE decompression routine, so I included that in the program. I had never done any stand-alone sample playing before. The only time I had was through use of a tracker, so that was something new. The scrolling part in the credits is new for me too, so I guess there are lots of things that I learned! I suppose that's a good thing ;)

Anyway, I hope you like my second NES game. There's still a whole lot of stuff to learn on my end, but it's fun! Oh yeah, my sons' mug is on the label, and that's his voice in the game. He was awesome to work with on this project! Downloads are under the screenshots.

    <desc>Go North to the Arctic and meet Mr. Penguin. He is one of the great pioneers of the icy climate and if I may say so, a survivor. His game is collecting diamonds scattered in the coldest corners of the globe. Guide Mr. Penguin through each round and help him with his diamond collection. You must collect all the diamonds and stash them safely in your igloo. Watch out! Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way. Hang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let's try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!

    <desc>This is one of those games where there isn't actually a real game ... just a bunch of mini-games. Kinda like Mario Party. You're this penguin, and you compete in various competitions, like a Air Hockey/Dodgeball thing, Whack-A-Mole, and others. I couldn't get past the Air Hockey thing though, because I totally suck at this game. It's infuriatingly difficult.

Translation Description:

May. 18th 2007 Addendum - Spinner 8's Addendum Patch was released May 12, 2007 and fixes the problems listed below about the game messing up in most emulators. This is an unofficial addendum patch. It should be applied on top of an already patched ROM.

The title screen is in english, and the engrish text has been fixed. They could at least have made a GOOD title screen, but who are we to complain.

There wasn't much text in this game, but what was there is translated. You may experience some glitches, but they are most likely fault of the game itself rather than the patch. This was an unfinished, unreleased game of course.

This game uses mapper 2 (16KB PRG switching, possibly the easiest one to implement in an emulator). So, nearly any emulator should support it.

    <desc>Photon is an interesting idea for a game. The developers played Space Invaders one day, and they thought that it was fun that you could shoot upwards only. So naturally, they got together and coded an NES game just like Space Invaders! Except, they took out the bases. And the UFO's. And the aliens come at you one at a time, and they don't move in predictable patterns. And they made it so you could move along more than one axis. And they added a first-person dungeon to it, and even stole the graphics for it right out of the Ultima games. And they added pits. And they made it insanely easy to get lost unless you make a map with your trusty graph paper.

So, I guess you end up with a game that's isn't really like Space Invaders at all. Unless you count the upward shooting. That's still pretty fun.

Translation Description:

Everything is translated, but KingMike plans on going back later and expanding the windows to fit in bigger words and stuff. This may or may not actually happen however.

In "Regular Game" mode, you can either play in teams, or against the CPU. If you play against the CPU, or if you play with only 2 people, then the game is played by completing a series of minigames, every point scored revealing a part of a picture, and after the minigame is over, you must guess what the picture is, based on the amount you've been able to reveal.

If you're successful in guessing what the picture is, then you can "roll" a virtual die, to decide how many spaces you may move along the "board". The first person to reach the end of the board wins the game. Alternative Game Mode is played much the same way as "Regular Game Mode", except instead of the Computer supplying an answer, the designated drawer does so himself, and both teams may guess instead of just the drawer's team.

At the end of a round, the game asks which team was successful in guessing, and you may choose "Nobody did", Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, or Team 4. If noone wins, then play moves on to the other teams designated drawer, and a new round begins. If a team guesses correctly, they may roll the virtual die, and proceed down the board. The first team to reach the end of the board is declared the winner.

Don't let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it's the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you'll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that's a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can't get enough of Pinball Quest!

Control the flippers while trying to hit the ball in places where you can score big points! 

Controls:

A Button: Right Flipper, Launch Ball
B Button: Right Flipper, Launch Ball
Start Button: Pause, Unpause
Select Button: No use

Hints:

Disappearing Flippers
The flippers will disappear when you reach a score of 100,000 points. They reappear later.

    <desc>
Pin Bot, one of the finest pinball machines ever made, has now been converted to video. All of the action of the real game is here: robot-like speech, multi-ball play, the jet bumpers, and the mysterious robot visor. Some new features have been added as well: 6 progressively more difficult levels, enemies that attack your flippers or try to steal the ball on the playfield, and different ball shapes. Pin Bot talks. Pin Bot observes. Pin Bot challenges you.

--From the NES Pinbot instruction manual.

Overview:

Pinbot was a pretty fun game, but I think Pinbot fans were expecting a little more. The controls were done pretty well with an easy-to-learn scheme. They were also resposive enough to convert your real pinball skills over to the NES. The graphics were mediocre. They weren't drawn too bad, but I didn't really like the color scheme. The sounds were not too aggravating and were almost enjoyable. I really like the ability to play four players. That was a good idea. It also had a multiball feature that was a lot of fun. Overall I'd say that this is a fun game to play, but if you are an old Pinbot fan, watchout, you might be let down a little.

Directions:

Use your flippers to keep the ball up to get the highest score you can.

Controls:

A Button: Right Flipper
B Button: Plunger
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Shaking
Use select to shake the machine to the left, and use start to shake the machine to the right. Be careful though, if you do it too much it will tilt.

Can you think under pressure? How about under flooz pressure? You'll find out when you play Pipe Dream, the fast moving game of speed, strategy and plumbing. Make your pipeline as long as you can, but always stay ahead of the flow or your score will go down the drain.

A totally radical game entrenched in a deep underground maze of never-ending pipes. Here is your big chance to try out those plumbing skills. The water is on, think ahead, and most of all, keep on your toes. Nasty accidents do happen! The general idea is to keep the water flow happening by adding the most appropriate piece of pipe. Well, it sounds easy enough, but the pace gets pretty hectic as the water stream picks up momentum. You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath. Don't relax for too long or the only breath you'll be catching is underwater. The minute you thought you were done with this floor, here comes the next floor, just a little faster. Watch out... a totally addictive game!

Sail the seas as a bloody Buccaneer! Capture enemy ships, plunder coastal towns, dig for buried treasure, rescue lost family members, form alliances with colonial powers, even marry the governor's daughter!

Directions:

As you may gather from the preceding description, this game has it all. It's an action-strategy-sim-rpg if there ever was one. And there was, and this is it. It includes a life-spanning career for your pirate alter-ego, ship-to-ship battle, over-land battle, sword duels, all manner of quests, a gold-hungry, blood-thirsty and sometimes mutinous crew, winds, tides, rocks, reefs, fencing, fighting, chases, escapes, miracles, true love... wait a minute, I think that was The Princess Bride. Anyway, it's all here, too.

Controls:

A Button: Select, Fire Canon, Sword Thrust
B Button: Cancel, Sword Slash
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Display Menu
Up/Down: Raise/Lower Sails, Attack High/Low

Hints:

Special Skills
You are asked at the beginning to choose a special skill for yor hero. These skills can really affect your game so it helps to know what they do: Fencing helps you win duels, and can turn the tide if you take on an opponent with a stronger crew than yours. Navigation helps you move around the map faster, and maneuver in ship combat. Gunnery improves the aim of your cannon, which can be very important. Wit and Charm will help you make alliances, get better rewards for helping local officials, and of course the ladies will fall all over you. Medicine will kep you healthy and strong so that you don't get old and decrepit and forced to retire early.</desc>

    <desc>Learn basic katakana with Popeye and friends! Whee yeah hurrays! Popeye's Lingo Game takes the ever-popular "what the hell is this katakana word supposed to actually MEAN" game and, well... turns it into a real live game.

If you're one of those (many, many, many) people that don't know what katakana is, don't worry about it. That's why the world has ROM translations.

So anyways, in Word Puzzle A, you choose a category, and you're given a word in katakana, which you must decipher into its English equivalent. In its original form, this could be a nice little katakana primer for you budding first-year Japanese students. The problem is, it's not intended for the English-speaking populace. So, sometimes you get the actual Japanese word in katakana, which has no relation at all to the word in English. At that point, you're pretty much on your own.

Word Puzzle B does away with the Japanese entirely and just gives you some blanks. At this point the game just becomes Hangman with a Popeye theme. Yawn. Word Catcher seems to be some two-player thing that I have no idea how to play.

Translation Description:

KingMike had to do some crazy fun things to translate this game, so the ROM must be expanded to 40KB before you patch it. There's a text file in the zip named POPEXP.TXT that will walk you through it. If your patch doesn't work, THIS IS MOST LIKELY THE PROBLEM.

Everything was already in English except for those katakana words, so that's done. Also KingMike made a new title screen. La! I'm not really seeing the point of a translation of this game, but KingMike did it, so hurrays go to him for it.

Popeye and Brutus are at it again in this video contest for Olive Oyl's affection. As Popeye, you must battle the likes of Brutus and the Sea Hag while you race to collect all of the floating hearts that Olive tosses to you. Once you have Spinach power, Popeye can conquer all, but without it, watch out!

--From the NES Popeye instruction manual.

Overview:

Just like the cartoon series, Popeye and Brutus are fighting over the beautiful Olive. So Brutus kidnaps Olive, and Popeye must save her! Brutus and his pals will try to stop Popeye, but Popeye can use many things to his advantage!

Directions:

To score points and beat the level, you must collect the heart-shaped tokens that Olive drops. Also, avoid Brutus so he doesn't kill you. But that doesn't make you totally vulnerable! Grab the spinach that Popeye loves oh so much to become super-strong, and you can kill Brutus that way. But it only works for the level you're using it.

Controls:

A Button: Punch
B Button: No use
Start Button: Start game, Pause, Unpause
Select Button: Select between games on main menu

    <desc>The second NES game released by Enix, the first being the forgettable Door Door. I don't know much about this game, but it's by Yuji Horii, so you know it rocks. At first it looks like a standard text adventure, but I hear later on it becomes a weird Wizardry-style dungeon crawler thing.

(DvD adds):

This is the first adventure game released on the Famicom. Yuji Horii ported this, his successful NEC PC-8801 game, to the Famicom to determine whether the Famicom action game crowd would take to an adventure game. The game did quite well. Because of this, Horii was able to release the game he really wanted to make for the Famicom, the first Japanese console RPG: Dragon Quest.

Translation Description:

Patch is: 100% Complete, 100% Edited Script, 100% Tested.

Christmas Eve, 2200. The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place. At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.

"In 2191, Earth's blissful existence was governed by a powerful master computer. Then one day, something went wrong ith the master control program! Chaos ensued as people paniced! Nova was summoned. - Nova, you must contact six agents, that are hiding in the six sectors protecting the master computer. Your contacts are:
John Gordon, Robert Williams, David Strader, Lynda Baker, Martin Douglas, Daniel Leeds.

Each contact will give you an ID card used to access the security room located in a different sector. Defeat the guards within the security rooms and grap the secret tape units. After you obtain all the six security units, you will gain access to the control center. At the control center, you must defeat the guards to destroy the computer and restore the society.

Be careful Nova....and watch your backside!" 

Directions:

In each stage, you must get a contact, which is necessary to complete the level. Why, you ask? Without it, you can't fight the boss. Then you must find the portal. You will start with a lone boomerang, but as you progress, you can collect items that will increase attack length and number of boomerangs.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Throw boomerang
Start Button: Pause/Unpause, see item menu
Select Button: Use special weapon

You're Mark Tyler, and by the year 2006, you've successfully defended your Heavyweight title nine times. In order to determine the best boxer in the universe, the Intergalactic Boxing Federation has invited you to participate in a tournament where you'll face 12 of the greatest fighters in the galaxy. You'll face everything from cyborgs to mutants as you step into the ring for the most important fights of your boxing career. Head to the IGBF Training Ship to get in some quality workouts, because you've never faced opponents like these before.

It's believed that one of your metallic opponents has a left hook that could flatten an entire building! Take advantage of all your boxing knowledge and experience in the ring, and you might just emerge as the Heavyweight Champion of the Universe!

Trivia:

Soon after the release of Punch-Out!!, Beam Software began developing an official sequel starring Mike Tyson with manager Don King. Originally titled Mike Tyson's Intergalactic Power Punch, the game was supposed to take the series into outer space where Tyson would participate in an intergalactic boxing tournament against various space aliens.

The game's production ran into immediate trouble, however, following Tyson's incarceration for the rape of Desiree Washington. Beam changed the Tyson character's name to Mark Tyler and modified King but did little to change Tyson's in-game character sprite.

Nintendo saw the game and disliked it, refusing to publish it due to lack of quality. Eventually, American Softworks Corp. published the title, and the game was released on the NES as Power Punch II, despite the fact that there never was a first Power Punch title.

Your code name is Bart. You are a captain of the Army Special Forces Unit. Your mission is to infiltrate GOON (Government of Offensive Network), a subversive organization whose aim is to break up the international economy and establish a worldwide smuggling ring. You will accomplish this by purposely being captured and imprisoned in their escape-proof armed camp. You'll have to fight your way out with your bare fists - but is you can break into the ammunition depot, you'll find grenades, knives, and M-16's to tip the odds in your favor. Your goal is to find and eliminate the leaders of GOON before they can carry out their diabolical scheme!

--From the NES POW instruction manual.

Overview:

An army-like story. You play a commando who deliberately gets himself captured so he could break out and destroy the enemy forces who captured him! Not much of a story.

Directions:

You have to get to the left side of the screen to the right. You can beat up the enemies with your hands and feet or you can use weapons like knifes, rifles, armor, brass knuckles and hand grenades! Fight many cool bosses, too!

Controls:

A Button: Kick
B Button: Punch, Use weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause, start game, choose selected option at title
Select Button: Select between options at title menu

Hints:

20 Lives
Press A, B, B, Up, Up, Down, Left, Start at title menu

One day, the peaceful nation of the Lextorians discovers the planet P'radikus, where numerous uncivilized tribes are constantly at war with one another. When they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems, you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home planet with a secret weapon known as "Thunderbolt".

Using the typical thrust movement from the Asteroids games, you roam space with your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus.

To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.

Despite a simple and rather clich? premise (a knight must rescue a captured princess and restore order to the kingdom), its plot is fairly complex by 8-bit console gaming standards. Taking the role of Sir Cucumber, a knight, the player must defeat the evil Minister Pumpkin who has kidnapped Princess Tomato. Early on, Sir Cucumber gains a sidekick, Percy the baby persimmon, who offers advice and helps throughout the quest.

    <desc>Princesstual Orgy is the touching story of a Japanese comedian, his yoyo, and four fairy princesses. And despite the name of this game, "his yoyo" is not a metaphor for anything (phallic or otherwise).

Anyway, here's the dilly, yo. You are Tashiro Masashi, a japanese comedian that you probably have never heard of unless you've lived in Japan, or are one of those crazy people who creams themselves whenever they think about japanese culture. Anyway, one night Tashiro is awakened by a fairy because she wants him to rescue some fairy princess from the clutches of four evil witches, thus saving the world from the dread Ultra Witch. You know she's really bad. They don't just throw the title Ultra out to just any witch.

Easy, right? WRONG. This is, after all, an NES platformer that doesn't involve Megaman or Mario or the Belmont clan. That means the controls are touchy, Tashiro walks rather slowly, and enemies get to ignore things like walls. Oh, and as soon as anything scrolls off of the screen, it ceases to be. You will be killed by enemies every so often, but not as often as you miss jumps, and not nearly as often as you toss your control pad at the wall.

That's not to say this is a bad game, it just will try your patience, as do most NES platform games.

Translation Description:

The funny thing is, when InVerse first released this translation, all it did was change the title screen. A day or two later he uploaded the correct patch and princess fun was had by all. And that is my story for tonight. Thank you, thank you very much.

Anyway the translation is very nice, so have fun with it.

Face off against some of the meanest, toughest wrestlers in a tournament or a 2 out of 3 falls contest! So, if you're a long time wrestling fan, casual fan, or a new fan, give this game a go!

Directions:

If you like to invite your friends over to see who can beat the pie out of everyone else without actually hurting each other, this was almost certainly the best of the early platform offerings, and remains an entertaining diversion to this day. Sure the graphics are a bit rough, and the sound effects are pretty laughable, but you won't be able to get that theme music out of your head, and you'll actually find yourself having fun all the while! Six different fighters with individual styles and unique specialty moves battle it out for the trophy. Kick and punch your way around the ring, then grapple your opponent to go for the serious moves. Will it be the brutal Back Drop, the painful Piledriver , or the very sexy Vertical Suplex? Better yet, grab him near the ropes and throw him right out of the ring! That concrete floor sure is harder than the mat! When you think he's had enough, pin your poor opponent to the mat for a three-count and get ready for the next challenge!

Controls:

A Button: Kick, Pin, Flying Splash, Clothesline, Splash over the top rope
B Button: Punch, pick up opponent, double knee drop, knee lift
Start Button: Start game, pause
Select Button: Select a wrestler

Hints:

Battle the Great Puma

Development:

Genyo Takeda, who produced the Punch-Out!! arcade games, directed the NES versions. Because the NES was not as powerful as the arcade hardware, Takeda and his crew realized that it would be too difficult to make the NES port completely simulate the arcade versions. Instead of making the playable boxer wire-framed or transparent to see an opponent, they decided to shrink the playable boxer, so that players could easily see his opponents over his head. Though the arcade's playable boxer didn't have an official name, he was referred to as "Little Mac", because of his small stature. Other things added to the NES version that the arcade versions lacked were a rough plot, a background music track played during fights, animated cutscenes and a password system for saving progress.

Around the time the Gold Version was released, Nintendo of America's founder and former president Minoru Arakawa attended a boxing match featuring Mike Tyson. While watching the boxer fight, Arakawa became so astonished with the athlete's "power and skill", he was inspired to use the athlete's name and likeness in the upcoming port of the Punch-Out!! series to help the game sell well.

Gameplay:

Punch-Out!! features a boxer named Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version. The game requires good reflexes in reaction to the computer-controlled boxers' moves, as the more advanced boxers give very little indication of their coming moves. However, Punch-Out!! can be mastered by learning the computer-controlled boxers' consistent patterns.

Little Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. For defensive techniques, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block attacks.

Little Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack, but still able to defend. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches.

A bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within 10 seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate a high enough point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down. However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner.

When Little Mac loses his first bout, the opponent will offer a rematch. However if he loses a Title Bout, he will be ranked down (sometimes more than one place in the rankings.) On his second loss (if the loss was a rematch), he drops one place in the rankings (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit) and must fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.

Characters:

The character models in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! are each used twice, with the exception of King Hippo, just changing the head image, colors, and the unique special moves performed. The pairing is as follows:

Glass Joe/Don Flamenco, Von Kaiser/Great Tiger, Piston Honda/Mike Tyson or Mr. Dream, King Hippo/(Unique), Bald Bull/Mr. Sandman, Soda Popinski/Super Macho Man.

Other versions:

Before the release of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! in North America, Nintendo released it in a gold-colored Famicom cartridge simply titled Punch-Out!! in Japan, without Mike Tyson in it, as a prize for the Golf U.S. Course Famicom Tournament.[4] This version's final boxer was Super Macho Man, who was also the final boxer of the Super Punch-Out!! arcade. When Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! sold well in North America, Nintendo later released the Mike Tyson version in Japan.[5]

Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream:

Towards the end of the NES's run, Nintendo's license to use Mike Tyson as a special Punch-Out!! character expired. Therefore, Nintendo replaced Tyson with a fictional character based on a then-Nintendo tournament champion, Mr. Dream. A popular myth is that Tyson was removed due to his divorce from actress Robin Givens[3], and his conviction for rape, which did not occur until a year after the changeover. It is also believed by some[who?] that because Tyson lost the Heavyweight Championship to James "Buster" Douglas by the contract expiration, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new one with him.[citation needed] In August, 1990, the game was re-released simply as Punch-Out!! (or Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream according to Nintendo Power) only in North America. This version has become the "official" incarnation of the NES Punch-Out!!

Other releases:

Along with several NES titles by Nintendo, Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream was later ported to several other platforms in Nintendo media. In Animal Crossing, it was one of the rarer unlockable NES games one could acquire within the game[citation needed]. It was also released through the Wii's Virtual Console service on March 30, 2007 to the European and Australian regions, April 3, 2007 in Japan, and in North America on April 16, 2007. During that release, reports have surfaced stating that when the game is played in progressive scan, the Virtual Console version of Punch-Out!! suffers from a lag in controls, which significantly raises the difficulty level compared to other versions of it.[6] Nintendo later rereleased the Game &amp; Watch game, Boxing, retitled as Punch-Out!! to promote Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream's release. A remake of the game was released for the Wii in 2009.

Reception:

With its unique playability, graphics, and characters, Punch-Out!! has been well-received by many players and critics. It was rated the 17th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.[7] GameSpot has also placed it among the best games of all time. The title has been a source of satire[9] and nostalgic tribute[10] throughout the several years following its release.

The video game incarnation of Mike Tyson was named the 25th most diabolical video game villain of all time by GamePro.[11]

Other appearances:

Punch-Out!! was featured in the comic books of Valiant's Nintendo Comics System.Three stories are based around Little Mac, Doc Louis, and other boxers from the NES version, and Mac briefly appears in the comic that introduces the story of Captain N: The Game Master Mac doesn't appear in the Captain N stories himself; however, King Hippo is featured as a villain. Also, in the opening sequence of the Captain N TV series, the protagonist Kevin Keene was seen playing Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! before being forced into a vortex that formed in his television's screen.

In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Little Mac appears as a regular Trophy and an Assist Trophy. He sports a more textured look and performs punches and uppercuts.[12] In the same game, the music from the Manhattan skyline scene in Punch-Out!! can be heard in the song titled "Famicom Medley."[citation needed]

In the Wii game titled Captain Rainbow, Little Mac appears as a supporting character.

In the Family Guy episode Not All Dogs Go to Heaven, when Peter is asked to say the grace, he prays for cheat codes to Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! because he has been stuck on Bald Bull for 4 years.

In Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, Kumar mentions that he can play Punch-Out!! on his iPhone while driving after leaving the bottomless mansion party.

The game I Wanna Be the Guy uses Mike Tyson's rendering from this game as a boss.

Directions:

As you go through the game, you see that you'll be using the gun most of the time. You can change the weapons, however, at the bottom of the screen. How? Pause during play and switch weapons using the left and right buttons! Again, this is a side-scroller. You can kill baddies, collect pickups and whatever, and plain just mindlessly venture! Have fun!

    <desc>This is a nifty little game here. It's like Tetris or Columns, except a hundred times better :). Basically, Puyo fall from the top of the screen, and you have to match at least four of the same color to clear them. You can play it infinitely until you die ala Tetris and Columns, or you can play with certain goals, like trying to clear so many Puyo all at once, or to chain two clears together, etc. It's wicked fun, so try it out!

Yep, everything's been translated. LA.

The object of Puzzle is to reassemble a picture which has been scrambled. The picture is broken into a number of pieces with one or more open spaces. Slide the pieces into the open spaces to rearrange them back into the proper order.

If you're stuck, you have the option of challenging the computer to a game of chance like rock, paper, scissors or roll the dice. This will subtract 60 seconds from your time, but if won allows any two pieces on the board to be swapped. If you forget what the picture looks like, you can pause the game and see the completed version, but this can only be done five times per puzzle.

There are eight different levels, plus two additional expert levels.

This is..... a puzzle game!!! Did ya guess that already? Well, the name might not be very puzzling, but some of the levels in this game sure are! Puzznic is very similar to Fire and Ice (another NES game) in game play, but there's more color (thank goodness!).

The music is, quite honestly, terrible. When you begin to run out of time, it's nerve jangling, utterly out of tune, and sour. But hey, it's also unnecessary, so just turn it off if you can't tolerate it. The jeweled puzzle pieces are pretty and nice to look at. The screen is uncomplicated by the awful obfuscating backgrounds that so many puzzle games like this have. In other words, you can see what you're doing and there's no wondering if you're trying to move part of the puzzle or part of the scenery. Gravnic (another option in this game) has a different look as well as different game play than Puzznic. In Gravnic, you don't have a time limit so the music doesn't turn rotten on you (again, thank goodness!).

Game play is simple but engaging for both Puzznic and Gravnic. The controls and rules aren't difficult to figure out, but the solution to each stage can be!

Directions:

Puzznic: 

Slide the pieces to match them up and clear each stage of all pieces. Press A or B and hold it when then cursor is over the piece you want to move. Then, press a direction to slide the piece in that direction. You must get at least two pieces to touch horizontally or vertically to clear them, but you can get more than that to vanish at once for more points. Be careful. While there may be more than one way to solve each stage, not every way will work! If you have just one of any kind of block left, you won't be able to clear that block or complete the stage without retrying or continuing. Some stages will have moving parts that make it harder to get pieces to where you need them to be. Sometimes, timing will be crucial as you have to move a block onto a moving block and then move it back quickly! You can move pieces while other pieces are still dropping, and sometimes that's what you'll have to do to clear a stage.

Sometimes you will have to build a bridge by dropping pieces down on top of each other so that you can get to a previously unreachable area, and some stages will have more than one area on the screen that needs to be cleared. Since each stage is timed, you have to work quickly. If the time runs out you will have to continue, which will lose any points you've accumulated.

Gravnic:

In Gravnic, you must still clear all pieces. Pieces will vanish when two of the same color touch on a side, not corners. Instead of a time limit, there is a limit on the number of moves you can make. "MAX" tells you how many moves you have left to complete the stage, but you don't have to use them all. The less moves you clear the stage in, the more points you'll make. When you press a direction the pieces will all move in that direction (as if you changed gravity to pull the pieces in that direction, thus the name Gravnic). Obstructions will keep certain pieces back while allowing others to pass through. Some obstructions are stationary and won't move when you change gravity, but some will slide with the pieces. By paying attention to the shape of the board, you can decide which directions to move the pieces so that they match up in the end without leaving any one piece of any color. 

Controls:

A Button: Select Block (Puzznic), Select Direction (Gravnic)
B Button: Select Block (Puzznic), Select Direction (Gravnic)
Start Button: Start Game, Pause, Continue/Retry

Hints:

Don't Go 'Round
Note that, in Puzznic, you can move the cursor over the grey blocks on the screen that aren't part of the edge. This means that you don't have to go around them. Knowing that can save you valuable seconds!

Q*bert has been captured by the Tazmanians and thrown into a time warp. To escape, he must hop his way through the deadly pyramids, changing each square to the proper color and avoiding nasty foes all the while.

"Your supreme challenge is to guide Q*bert through the entire time warp, until you free the pug nosed hero so he can return to his true calling in life -- playing a stuntman double for Don Johnson!"

--from the NES Q*bert instruction manual

Q Bert was one of my favorite games on the NES. It was ported fairly well from the arcade game. The controls were a little weird at first, but once you get used to them they're not too bad. Q Bert was a big hit in the arcade. It was still a big hit when it came out on the NES. Now, it's kinda been forgotten. Relive the past and give this arcade classic a try!

Directions:

Hop on the blocks to change the color to the designated color for that stage. Q Bert was a fairly difficult game to get good at. It's not too bad at first, but once you get to the higher levels, you have to step on the blocks twice, and after that, they will change back to their original color if you hop them twice. I've never made it past the first stage of the third level.

Controls:

A Button: None
B Button: None
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Maximum Point Score
If you can keep from using your flying discs, you will get more points for them after beating the level.

The objective of Qix is to fence off, or "claim", a supermajority of the playfield. At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qixa sticklike entity that performs graceful, but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle. 

The player controls a small diamond-shaped marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker completes a closed shape, the captured area becomes solid and points are awarded. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points.

The player is vulnerable and can lose a life when drawing Stix if the Qix touches a Stix line as it is being drawn, before it becomes solid. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area.

As the last traces of color leave the sky you're hanging out by your new wheels, anxious for the race to start. Transamerica - from the West Coast to the East Coast. Okay. It's time. You jump into the driver's seat, feeling the awesome power beneath you. Stepping through the gears, the cars around you fade into tiny specks in the rear view mirror.

Look out! You're on top of a hairpin curve. Whoa. The tires screech and your heart hits your rib cage, but you make it, laughing. There's only a few more of these 'till you reach the plains.

Then it happens. Another curve hits you in the face. It's too fast. You struggle for the shoulder, but the next thing you know you're catapulting through the air - almost weightless - until your body tears up against the seat belt. Then. All is still.

Not a scratch on you. And the protective ceramic overcoating on your car did the trick - no major damage. You let out a scream, turn the car around, and hit it. There's still time. But you've got to be cool. Alert. You're headed straight for the coast and those glorious checkered flags. Defying the odds again.

--From the NES Rad Racer instruction manual.

Overview:

This was probably the first popular racing game on the NES. I always loved the ability to change the music while you are driving. The controls were great. They were easy to learn and very responsive. Rad Racer also had a very unique feature. It had a 3-D mode. If you hit select during gameplay, it would switch into 3-D mode. You needed a pair of red and blue 3-D glasses to see it, but it was pretty cool. Rad Racer was definitly a landmark game, I reccomend you give it a go. 

Directions:

Be the raddest racer you can be and out race the competition. 

Controls:

A Button: Gas
B Button: Brake
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select/3-D mode

Hints:

Continue
After losing a race, hold in A when you hit start, and you will start from the track you lost on.

You will encounter more danger as you pilot a boat across the Swamp and travel through Space to an eventual confrontation with Pitbull himself in the Computer Center!

    <name>Raid on Bungeling Bay</name>
    <path/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
We have obtained information that the Bungeling Empire is trying to conquer the Earth by developing a War Machine. In order to stop this, you must sneak into their center (Bungeling Bay) to destroy the six secret factories using a helicopter. This is your mission.

--From the NES Raid on Bungeling Bay instruction manual.

Overview:

The Bungeling Empire is attempting to take over the world! Your mission is to fly in with your attack helicopter and destroy their factories before they can finish their War Machine. You are not alone, fortunately you will be backed up by an Aircraft Carrier which can repair damage to your chopper and renew your supply of bombs.

Directions:

Bungeling Bay is the center of the Empire's military operations. There are six weapons factories located on the various islands of the Bay. Each factory is surrounded by radar dishes to track your movements, as well as machine gun turrets, surface-to-air missiles, and tanks.

In addition there are patrol boats in the waters of Bungeling Bay, and airstrips on the islands which will send fighter jets to attack both your helicopter and your Carrier.

The Raid on Bungeling Bay is about to begin! Search the islands for factories, destroying defenses along the way. The Bay is approximately 10 screens high and 10 screens wide, and wraps around so that you will contantly circle the battlefield if you move in one direction. To destroy a factory you will often need your entire payload of bombs, sometimes even more, so always return to the carrier after destroying a factory. Also the carrier will repair any damage you have sustained on your bombing runs. You will see your damage represented by a number between 0 and 100. The chopper becomes harder to control the more damage it takes, and when damage exceeds 100 you will go into a tailspin, crash and burn.

Remember that the factories are your primary concern. All other enemies are just there to protect the factories, and in fact the factories will just keep producing more tanks, planes, boats and turrets. Also keep in mind that if you bomb a factory but do not destroy it, it will rebuild itself over time. You will see whether a factory is active by the flashing lights on it. When the lights go dark, the factory is disabled. It will be repairing itself but won't produce any more tanks, turrets, or radar.

Finally, you must be concerned with keeping your Carrier afloat. It will be attacked by enemy bombers and eventually by a Battleship. You must shoot down the bombers and bomb the Battleship before they sink your Carrier, otherwise you will no longer be able to get more bombs or repair your vehicle. If you can find the Docks and hit the Battleship before it is completed, it will be much easier to destroy. 

Controls:

Up: Accelerate Forward
Down: Stop, Move Backwards Slowly
A Button: Fire Guns, Take Off and Land on Carrier
B Button: Drop Bombs
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Choose Game Type

Hints:

Take Out the Radar!
Radar Dishes and Patrol Boats are the enemy's primary resource for tracking your movements and sending defensive forces against you. Take them out quickly whenever you see them, to prevent them from sending fighter jets after you.

Runways
If you can find the Runways you can take out fighters and bombers on the ground, while they can't fight back!

Rainbow Rider

Far away in the middle of the Rainbow Sea, seven islands rise from the salty water. This is where Bubby was born, not long ago, under a brilliant rainbow. Bubby has always been able to make rainbows spring from his hands just for fun. One day while Bubby and his brother Bobby were playing in the woods, Krabo, an old monster, cast an evil spell on the islanders. Bubby knew right away that only he and his rainbow magic could save his family and friends. In order to break Krabo's evil spell, Bubby must explore all seven islands and collect a big diamond from each one. This is the only way he can defeat Krabo. You must help Bubby in his mission!

HURRY BUBBY! After a certain amount of time the islands will sink and there will be no one left to save! Along the way Bubby will have many adventures and get into all kinds of trouble. You must help Bubby make decisions that could determine the fate of all the islanders. Good luck Bubby!

    <desc>One of the ways in which Rainbow Silkroad is neat is because it's somewhat loosely based on historical fact. Not so historical as that you'd actually learn something, but just enough that you'd say "oh hey, that's neat" every once in a while. You take the role of the long-lost prince of Littleland, who must reclaim his throne from the guy Zrool that took the throne and was evil. Yeah the plot sucks, but it's irrelevant to the coolness that is this game. Instead the heart of the game is commerce. You take advantage of prices of various goods in various towns, and go back and forth trading goods to get more money. And don't think you can just kill monsters instead; all that monsters give you are License Points that, when enough are collected, will get you a license to trade in a certain good, such as oil. You don't have any stats or experience either! The only way you can increase your attack or HP or whatever is by buying more powerful weapons and armor. Sounds cool, doesn't it? Of course it does, dammit! 

So go play!

Translation Description:

Though this translation's a little rough in a few places, everything's been very nicely translated and completely in understandable English. Play the game.

    <desc>
Rally Bike is a top-down scrolling racing game where you compete with other bikes through a variety of landscapes. It features 1 player and 2 player modes. In 2 player mode, you and friend take turns trying to place against the competition. When one player wrecks, the other gets his turn. You begin on a bridge and race through forest and cityscapes. The graphics are good NES quality, and a jingly musical accompaniment plays while you try to gain position on a field of 50 other riders. Control response is good, but the scrolling of the screen causes unavoidable obstacles to appear suddenly.

This game is frustratingly difficult to the point that it isn't fun at all. If your bike comes in contact with anything other than the actual racing surface, you lose a bike and you must start over at the beginning of the track. Unless you enjoy an extreme challenge, Rally Bike is not a game I would recommend.

Directions:

At the start of the race, you are in 50th place in the field of riders. You must pass other riders, avoid contact with everything other than the racing surface, and place at least 30th by the end of the heat.

As you approach, riders will serve slightly towards you, and a bell chimes when you gain position on another rider. Should your rider come in contact with other riders, foliage in the forest, or even the borders that outline the track, you lose a bike and must start from the beginner of the track.

Your bike starts with a full tank of fuel, which is expendable. Stopping on the fuel icon on the track will add fuel until you take off again. A helicopter flies over certain areas along the track, leaving several items to aid you in the race. Items and effects are: fuel (adds fuel), turbo (temporary speed boost), 2 small flanking bikes (each absorbs a hit), and a helmet (temporary invincibility). Finish the race at the qualifying rank or better, and you move on to a different, more difficult race. 

Controls:

A Button: Accelerator
B Button: Brake
D-Pad UP: Turbo Boost
Start Button: Start Game
Select Button: Number of Players

Hints:

Slow Down in the Forest
Slow your top speed by using either the accelerator or the turbo boost to propel your bike through the forest. Using both in the forest will make the bike difficult to control and therefore easy to wreck.

Choose between two gigantic monsters, George or Lizzie, and destroy town after town, until you die or you beat the game!

There's not really much story to this game. A couple of people have been turned into giant monster animals, and of course everyone starts trying to kill them. So they go on a Rampage. Understandable, I think.

Directions:

Take on the role of one of these monsters, George the Great Ape, or Lizzie the Large Lizard. Go from city to city, knocking down building and trying not to get killed. Many opponents will try to get in your way, from Army snipers, to local police, to rednecks in pickup trucks, to Helicopters and Tanks.

Smash everything in sight with your mighty fists. Behind the windows and walls that you destroy, you will often find items waiting. Eat food and occasionally people to increase your health. Beware, there are many things in the building that will harm you, such as poison and explosives!

In two-player mode, you can choose to work together causing maximum damage, or compete for high scores. You can, of course beat each other up, and if you eat your opponent while he is in tiny human form, you reduce his score to zero! 

Controls:

A Button: Punch, Grab
B Button: Jump
Start Button: Pause, selects character
Select Button: Selects between characters

Hints:

Continue Code
Press B when you die to come back to life.

R.B.I. Baseball 3 took the popular baseball series a step further statistically, adding each Major League Baseball division winning team from 1983-1990, in addition to the 1989 All Star teams and all 26 1990 teams (with full 1989 statistics). Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions. Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.

RBI BASEBALL first set the standard as the only baseball game for play on the NES to use real players and their stats. RBI BASEBALL 2 raises the standard to a new level: You get all 26 pro teams, each with a roster of 24 real players. Every player comes with his actual 1989 stats. There's instant replay, as well as new and improved animation, graphics, music and sound effects to make the game come alive. As the manager, you get the designated-hitter rule, switch-hitting, and your own lineup of starters and subs. It's so great, it's approved by the Major League Baseball Players Association!

No other baseball game gets you closer to playing in the big time than R.B.I. Baseball. Because every one of the ten teams in R.B.I. Baseball contains the rosters and player stats officially licensed from the MLB Players Association. Like real baseball, these skills and stats affect the outcome of every play. Like a real manager, you'll need to make good use of this vital information - and wise strategy decisions - if you want a winning record. R.B.I. Baseball is so intensely realistic, we've added amusing animation and a touch of humor to keep the action light-hearted and fun. You can play against the computer in a nine game season or compete against a friend in your own best-of-seven series. Stop playing with no-names and step up to the plate with real superstars in R.B.I. Baseball!

This second Pro-Am racing game for NES introduces some innovations compared to its predecessor. Once again, you have to bring your red radio-controlled car to victory, score points, hit turbo speed lines, and leave no chance to your blue, green, and yellow adversaries. But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.

Race your R.C. car to the head of the pack of highly competitive drone cars. Push it to the limit on every corner as your tires squeal and you jockey for position to take the lead. Increase your car's performance with "turbo," "top speed," and "sticky tire" items found on the race courses. Look for missiles, bombs, and bonus letters while avoiding water and oil hazards. 32 exciting R.C. tracks and a vadety of car types await your challenge.

--From the NES RC Pro AM instruction manual.

Overview:

You are a radio-control racecar driver, your goal is to place in the top three of every race to win the trophy and prize money.

Directions:

This game is pretty cool and fun, I must admit, even though it can be a little frustrating as well. The first thing you need to remember is that it's a Remote Control race, which means that your steering is always relative to you car's current position, not which way you want to go on the screen.

After you've got this worked out in your head you should be okay. There are lots of stuff to pick up, like sticky tires to improve handling, engine upgrades to boost top speed, and turbo drives to enhance acceleration. Also there are Bombs and Missiles to blast your rivals into smithereens. As you may intuit, missiles fire forward to take out anyone presumptuous enough to be in front of you, and bombs drop behind you to chastise any driver who makes so bold as to try to pass you. Unfortunatly, you can't have both, so when you pick up bombs your entire stock of missiles will be changed to bombs and vice-versa.

Also there are glowing letters on the track which you use to spell out N-I-N-T-E-N-D-O. When you collect all the letters you get a cool new vehicle which is supposed to be better than the one you started with but I'm not so sure. In any case the opponents get upgraded too, so it seems to be a bit of a moot issue. Also, this game is notorious for cheating, i.e. your rivals will suddenly become speed demons and catch up from impossible distances behind you. So don't get cocky, your lead is never secure! 

Controls:

A Button: Fire Weapon
B Button: Accelerate
Start Button: Start/Pause

Hints:

Watch the Leader!
The race ends when the first car crosses the finish line, regardless of how far behind the other cars might be. In any other race you would have the opportunity to improve your standing by overtaking another driver or two, since a real race doesn't end until everybody finishes. However in this case, assuming you aren't in first place, you may need to do something desperate just before the checkered flag waves.

    <desc>Most people don't know that there are alternate modes of the game Recca, which are accessed by very obscure means.

This hack makes them selectable from the start, adds a new title screen and translates the sound test mode as well (See the readme on how to access this).

New Modes:

Hard: 7 levels as opposed to the 4 normally available. Can be toggled on or off with Select on the title screen.

Zanki Attack: Same as either normal or hard mode with three differences enemies explode into bullets, you start with 50 lives and there is no ending sequence. Score is determined by how many lives you have left when you beat the game.

    <desc>In the early 1900's, a brutal series of animal rapes occurred which took a small rural town in China by storm. As quickly as the rapes started, they stopped and all was peaceful?until now.

69 years later, it's happening again. Animals are going fucking ballistic and rampaging in the streets. You must stop them the only way possible.. by raping them into submission! Seek answers as to why these animals are going insane and put a stop to it.

Features: All text is edited/replaced with comical and inane dialogue. All enemies are changed for the better! An all new story. Scenery is changed to fit the story. Main character's starting stats have been overhauled to prevent having to grind enemies for hours.

Enjoy!

Welcome to MTV's Remote Control. Now you can play MTV's ridiculous trivia quiz game show on your NES system! MTV's Remote Control will challenge your knowledge of Classic TV Sitcoms, Rock Stars, Celebrities, and Rumors; as well as Soaps and Cop Shows. So try to upstage and outclass your friends or favorite NES opponents with the results of your years of cultural research in this irreverent, fast-paced game for today's generation of TV trivia heads. And remember, if you win, you should be ashamed of yourself. Here's how to get started down the road to intellectual degradation.

--From the NES MTV's Remote Control instruction manual.

Overview:

This game is based on the show which aired on MTV in the late 1980s. It uses your usual quiz show format and asks you about the characters and events in popular TV show. You pick a category out of nine and a question is given. Buzz in first for your chance to answer the question. If you get the answer wrong, the question goes to the other players. The person with the highest score wins!

You'll expect some of the crazy things found in the show, but don't expect everything to be in the NES version. Also the theme song of the show is played the ENTIRE time, which is annoying after a while.

Directions:

Try to beat the other contestants in a game show that tests your knowledge about TV shows. 

Controls:

A Button: Buzz In, Confirm
B Button: Cancel
Start Button: Start Game
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Difficulty of Questions
The questions are of average difficulty, but you might not know the answers to some these questions right away because you were too young or haven't watched the shows mentioned in the game.

In Renegade, the player controls a nameless thug who fights a variety of street gangs on his way to save his girlfriend. Unlike other similar games like Double Dragon and Final Fight, the playfield is limited to one two-screen-wide area (a subway platform, a park, an alley, a parking lot) and does not scroll continuously.

Out of the four levels in the game, the first and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of enemies; one with a stronger attack but less hit points, and one with a weaker attack and the ability to hold the player, but more hit points.

Ren &amp; Stimpy are up to their old tricks again in THE REN &amp; STIMPY SHOW: Buckeroo$! This time, Stimpy has invented a machine that pays you to play videogames called the Gametron 5000 Moneymaker!

There are three games in the Gametron. "Robin Ho?k of Logwood Forest" has you rob from the rich, give to the poor, and rescue Maid Moron. "Out West" is where Three-Fingered Ho?k and his sidekick Stimpy the Kid go on a journey to steal a horse and "Space Madness" has you trying to save Commander Ho?k (who has come down with Space Madness) and his ship from crashing into the Earth.

It's been 11 days since the political fanatics occupied the embassy, holding the ambassador and his staff captive. You've waited patiently while government negotiators tried in wain to arrive at a peaceful settlement. Now it's up to you and your band of commandos to get the captives out!

--From the NES Rescue instruction manual.

Directions:

"Your goal is to rescue all of the captives without losing any members of your team. To mount an effective assault, you must first position your snipers around the embassy. Your rescue team will then by lowered by helicopter onto the roof of the embassy." (instruction manual)

This game is short, but it is broken up into 3 different parts: Sneaking around with your snipers to get them in position, shooting with surviving snipers, and then using your rescue team to break in the building to rescue the hostages and kill every other enemy.

Start by picking the level and mission. The missions aren't actually different, they're just levels of difficulty. So really your just picking a difficulty level when you pick the level and mission.

Controls:

A Button: Fire gun/Make selection
B Button: Cancel Selection
Start Button: Start game
Select Button: Return to map

Hints:

Getting snipers in place
Do not rush the snipers too much when traveling or they will get shot before they make it to their positions (see left picture). Utilize the hiding places.

Shooting with snipers
Once snipers are in place, select one of them on the map, and look for moving shadows in the windows of the building. If you find one, shoot it! The more you are able to kill, the easier it will be for your rescue team. (Look at the picture on the right.)

    <desc>I've actually been fortunate enough to play this game on cart, with three other people with rahga's amazing four-player adapter. It's a Technos game, which means two things: one, all the characters look like they do in all the other Technos games, and two, it involves these characters beating the hell out of each other. This is why people love Technos games.

You can play two-on-two, or a four-player free-for-all, or a variety of other stuff. You play in a smallish arena, and beat each other up, and whoever's left standing wins. Totally fun! When you die you turn into food, which is really weird. So one of the other characters can actually eat your dead hamburger corpse, and gain back some life. The controls are pretty hard to get used to, but once you do you can really kick some ass.

Translation Description:

There's a few tiny rough spots in the translation that don't quite give this a "complete" status, but the readme says it's 98% complete, and it's well worth your time, so check it out dammit. It's complete enough for you to play through, that's for sure.

Some happy fun trivia for you: this was released on the same day that Transcore (Magic) released their complete Villgust (SNES) translation. So to promote it, oRdErEDchaos went to all of the messageboards that Wildbill had advertised Villgust in, and replied to all of Wildbill's "RELEASE: Villgust 1.0? messages with a message saying "Not as important RELEASE: Riki Kunio 0.95? or something like that. Naturally this has nothing to do with anything, but it's interesting and I just thought of it, and it's my site so I can do whatever I want goddammit.

In the Arcade Classic boxing game, hone your skills in the gym, then pummel your way through the tournament, or contend for the Title in the World Cicuit. Or power-up your fighter to challenge your friends in brutal 2-player mode.

Directions:

Wow. Let me say that again. Wow. This is one of the few sports games in my knowledge that have an RPG aspect. As you fight, you gain Power Points which can be distributed to Punch, Speed, and Stamina, so you control how your fighter improves throughout the game. Each opponent has certain strengths, so you can change your distribution before each fight (Up for Punch, Left for Speed, Right for Stamina, Down to Reset). Now I can't say much for the sound effects, but the graphics are actually pretty good for the times, and the crowd of screaming fans is composed of individual figures and faces instead of a wallpaper of blobs. But that doesn't matter at all because you're going to be busy throwing punches, bobbing and weaving, covering and dodging, and generally treating your opponent like a side of beef that needs tenderizing, while avoiding the same fate for yourself.

Controls:

A Button: Select Name or Password, Punch
B Button: Input Password, Defend
Start Button: Start/Pause Game
Select Button: Choose Game Mode

Hints:

Power Password
When you start the game,input the following password to begin with 99 Power Points, World 1 Rank, and a record of 149-0. 4F9G0SLE4S9

Invincibility Code
At the start of a bout, in the training gym screen, push the following buttons on your controllers to become invincible: Con.2 (A), Con.1 (A, Sel, A), Con.2 (B), Con.1 (Sel), Con.2 (A,B), Con.1 (B,B)

Panic in River City!

"To the citizens of River City: I hold your high school captive! With my gangs of students and vicious bosses roaming the streets, nobody can stop me now. Meet my demands - or else!"

Slick, the meanest, most powerful gang lord in River City, has issued this ultimatum - and the entire town is powerless in a grip of fear!

Fortunately, Alex and Ryan weren't in school the day Slick took it over. But now, their fellow students are prisoners - including Ryan's girlfriend! It's up to our two young heroes to battle their way past several dangerous city gangs, then defeat the gang lord to free the students of River City High and restore peace to the panic-stricken populace!

--From the NES River City Ransom instruction manual.

Overview:

River City Ransom is a pretty fun game. I liked the mix between fighter and adventure. You can go into stores and talk to people to buy food, and books that will teach your charecter new techniques. The graphics on River City Ransom were pretty good too. The people were a little unproportional, but they still looked good. There are also a lot of weapons to pick up and fight with. You can also throw the weapon at the attacker. River City Ransom is a very fun game and I think everyone should try it at least once. 

Directions:

Save River City and Ryan's girlfriend from Slick.

Controls:

A Button: Punch/Use weapon
B Button: Kick/Throw weapon
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Life Bar/Cash amount

Hints:

Faster Attack
If you want to be able to kick, punch, or use a weapon faster, then buy books at the bookstore. Use them, and you will acquire the technique. You will need to buy a book for every technique.

    <desc>This is Kunio's first outing on the NES, which some of you may know as Target: Renegade. (shock, horror) This is pretty close to most other Kunio fighting games, but this one has the special distinction of having Kunio not being able to kick in front of him. Good old Technos. This game is hard, so don't bother kicking up the difficulty. The "hard" setting for the game is really just plain unfair. Then again, I do suck at old-school fighters.

Translation Description:

Apparently this was a quick and easy patch, and there's not really much to rate except the nice title screen and the fact that what text there is in the game makes sense. Hurrah! By the way, I suck mightily at this game, which you may be able to tell from the fact that the only proper gameplay shot is on the first screen.

Grab the controls of your high-performance armored car and take off on an action packed journey into the future, where survival is the only law. Accelerate down the straightaways and spin around the turns, dodging land mines and toxic spills.

Blast opponents with your artillery gun and an array of special weapons dropped by the support jet. Your object is to reach the Rally Point at the end of each level-50 in all. The farther you get, the more difficult it becomes. Avoid crashing into enemy cars, and look out for blasts from gun turrets along the sides of the road.

--From the NES Road Blasters instruction manual.

Overview:

Finish a series of road rallies without running out of fuel or crashing and burning.

Directions:

There's not a whole lot to this game, really. You aren't racing so much as just trying to survive, so don't worry about your speed too much. Just basically shoot everything that comes along, and be sure to pick up fuel globes (green or orange balls). Most enemies will just get in your way, some will try to make you crash and a few will shoot back at you. Occasionally a jet flies by and drops a special item for you: UZ Cannon, Electro Shield, Nitro, or Cruise Missile. Careful with the cruise misile, it blows up all enemies in your path but also destroys fuel globes. Also there are mines in the road which will blow you up, and toxic spills that don't harm you directly but might cause you to crash. 

Controls:

A Button: Fire Guns
B Button: Special Weapon
Up: Accelerate
Down: Brake
Start Button: Start, Pause

Hints:

Multiplier
The Multiplier on the left of the screen measures your accuracy and rewards you accordingly. Whenever you fire and hit a target, the multiplier increases, to a max of 10. Whenever you miss, it goes down. So, shoot carefully to maximize your score!

A top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time reaches out. Don't crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will loose gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up the hearts. Especially avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road slippery...

Road Runner is an interesting variant of the platformer genre, based on the Road Runner cartoon. The gameplay is very simple: the player controls Road Runner, who is chased by Wile E. Coyote. In order to escape, Road Runner runs endlessly to the left while the landscape scrolls by. In addition to avoiding the coyote, the player must pick up bird seeds on the street, avoid obstacles like cars, and get through mazes.

    <desc>Robocco Wars ("Robo Child Wars") is a Japan-only Family Computer game that lets the player control a shape-changing robot named R-10 (and his human controller Lance) as they fights evil robots. On the land, the player is a freight train that must follow the railroad tracks to the boss of the level. However, the robot turns into an airplane when the player is forced to fly to the next mission. Sea missions require the player to transform into a submarine.

Directions:

Play through 10 stages as a robot that can transform, jump and shoot enemies as a robot, spaceship, and submarine.

The player has three (3) lives and three (3) continues as he struggles to liberate the world of Robocco from evil.

Translation Description:

This is a complete translation patch for Robocco Wars for the NES. It translates the title screen courtesy of FlashPV, a japanese graphic which I designed and fixes up some engrish. There also appears to be two hidden/unused stages. I would like to see if they exist, but I'm not going to pursue the possibility. Although a level select cheat might do the trick.

What's Left:

Also one small graphic found in the ROM and haven't been able to find it in the game. It means Sayo-chan with a heart. Let me know if you find it.

Everybody's favorite cyborg cop returns to the Nintendo in ROBOCOP 3. The OCP has deployed Rehab Officers to wipe out Old Detroit in preparation for the erection of Delta City. Now it's up to RoboCop to join the fight against the Rehabs and save Detroit from total destruction.

As RoboCop, you have a newly redesigned suit which includes a multi-weapon arm attachment that has a large-bore cannon and a smart bomb as you take to the streets and make Detroit safe again. You'll face hordes of ED-209s, tanks, heavy artillery, and OCP's newest weapon: OTOMO. The entire city is counting on you, RoboCop, to clean up the streets and restore order.

Welcome to Old Detroit

Your first assignment may sound simple, but it isn't: Clean up the streets. You'll encounter thugs firing at you from the sidewalk, from windows and rooftops. Get rid of as many of them as possible. Be sure to pick ip food and weapons you come across - without them you won't be able to finish the job.

City Hall

A disgruntled employee is holding the mayor at City Hall. And the other half of the petty criminal in Detroit - the ones who weren't around when you took care of their comrades - have crawled out of their holes and are bent on revenge. Waste 'em!

The Warehouse

Your infrared vision will lead you to some startling discoveries. Just remember the directive "protect the innocent."

O.C.P. Headquarters

The drug lord, Clarence Boddicker, spilled his guts to you at the factory to save his own miserable neck. He tells you he works for Dick Jones, Senior Vice President at O.C.P., and Jones is behind about every major crime that's been committed, including the murder of a police officer. When you confront Jones at O.C.P. Headquarters and attempt to arrest him, you learn the nature of the mysterious classified Directive 4 - you can't act against any of O.C.P.'s corporate officers. He orders you to obey Directive 4 and put down your weapon - then your personal nightmare begins.

The Steelworks

Work your way up and down the many levels of the steelworks. Many more vicious scum bags wait for you here - heavily armed scum bags like Clarence Boddicker. You've never seen such firepower before. Use you head. There's a way to turn their strength against them.

The Boardroom

At last you come face to face with Dick Jones. The president of O.C.P. has fired Jones, so he's no longer protected by Directive 4. Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come. Will he stop at nothing? Be careful. It will take the strength of RoboCop to rid Detroit of Dick Jones.

--From the NES RoboCop instruction manual.

Overview:

Patrolman Murphy was gunned down in Detroit by a gang. They found what was left of Murphy, erased his memory and programmed his mind, and made him into a deadly killing machine, but they were not able to erase his memory of what the gang had done to him. Now he sets out to track down the gang responsible while fighting criminals in the streets, as RoboCop, the future in Law Enforcement! 

Directions:

In this game, you must punch or shoot any people or dogs that are around you. They will try to kill you, so try killing them before they hurt you. 

Controls:

A Button: Punch/Shoots if gun is in hand
B Button: Punch
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Block

Hints:

Infinite continues
After using all your continues, hold A+B+Select on the Game Over screen, then press Start and Continue from Main Menu.

THE LEGEND OF ALTILE...
In the distant future, overpopulation and pollution have plunged planet Earth into near ruin. World leaders have no way to solve the crisis, so they turn to Altile, a very wise scientist for possible answers. Altile is a genius, and after a short period of thought, devises a plan to rid the Earth of this terrible curse. In the year 2395 Earth's scientists and engineers follow Altile's plans and construct an artificial planet in the far reaches of the galaxy that will be home to a portion of the overpopulated Earth's people. All the people of Earth work together to complete and colonize the artificial planet. Unfortunately, Altile dies shortly after crafting his plans for the new world, and never sees his dreams come true. So, in his memory, the people name the planet Altile. Besides providing a new and peaceful home for the people of Earth, the new planet Altile also unites the nations of the Earth. Thoughts of war disappear and the half-man/half-machine RoboWarriors, who have defended the Earth for so long, are deactivated, and the two planets, Earth and Altile, exist in harmony.

THE ALIENS INVADE
But in the year 2036 A.A. (After Altile), led by their ruthless dictator Xur, the Xantho Empire from another dimension invade Altile, deactivating its specially constructed weather-control system and plunging the peace-loving people into bitter cold. The Xantho aliens transform the surface of the beautiful green planet into a barren and brown wasteland for their own diabolical uses. The inhabitants of Altile flee underground to escape the frigid temperatures that the Xantho Empire have inflicted on their planet. Before leaving, however, they send a message to their sister planet Earth begging for help. Although the Xanthos are cruel, the brave people of Altile vow never to surrender.

HELP ARRIVES
The Earth scientists receive the Altile plea and quickly reactivate the Z-Type Earth Defense cyborg (ZED), the most powerful of all RoboWarriors. They ready ZED for combat, preparing their fastest spaceship to send him across the galaxy to Altile. ZED lands in Landor on Altile, far from the alien Xantho main invasion force, yet he can see the terrible destruction Xur and his Xantho Empire have inflicted upon Altile-green plants withered, beautiful birds and animals gone. ZED knows he has to reach the weather-control station, but it's feared that Xur himself commands the vital base. ZED also holds a secret that will help him defeat Xur. Before disappearing underground, the people of Altile have left many assorted energy capsules hidden on the surface of their planet. These energy capsules not only increase the fighting abilities of RoboWarrior, but other special functions as well. ZED knows he must find the capsules to topple the Xanthos and restore freedom to Altile.

A WORLD OF WONDER
As you will discover, Altile is a magical land filled with wonderful surprises and plenty of challenges. You'll encounter dozens of strange aliens and see fantastic sights as you guide ZED on his quest above and below the surface of Altile. On your way to a final confrontation with Xur, you must use all your weapons and bombs to uncover the secret powers left by the people of Altile in order to help you defeat the Lords of Xanthos. It's a dangerous mission, but tremendous awards await ZED and the people of Altile should you succeed.

When the world was in Chaos, there was a big fight between the God of Heaven and Evils of Hell. The Evils were captured by the God of Heaven and restrained in four towers with four magic Balls. People have now lived peacefully for thousands of years. As time passed, the magic Balls were affected by the magnetic field and have become loose. At this moment, the Abbot of Sou-Lin Temple senses the crisis, then orders Pan-zo and Pan-lo to recapture the Evils with the four magic Balls.

The year is 1990. Low in the night sky appears an alien moon from which waves of ships descend upon Europe. Their occupants establish a new country called Greater Leutonia. The evil Leutonians, led by Colonel Krag, set out to conquer the world. In the wee hours of the morning the Leutonians land a zeppelin in Washington DC and kidnap Dr. Barnstorff and his beautiful daughter, Jane.

It's all up to you, a young American scientist, and your newly perfected rocket powered flying suit. Only you, by becoming Rocket Ranger, can rescue the Barnstorffs and save the world from the oppressive rule of the Leutonians. Go to it!

"Willy" the rising young jazz cat in New York City goes by the stage name of "The Rockin' Kat." However, the local crime boss, Mugsy, kidnaps Willy's girlfriend, "Jill". To rescue his girlfriend and defeat the gangster, Willy must venture through seven different levels or "channels" (from a television set) that feature various themes, thugs and bosses.

Willy is armed with a punch gun, that he can launch at the various thugs in the game, or to hook onto and swing from in a manner similar to Bionic Commando. Willy can also use the punch gun to grab and throw certain objects. Mastering the punch gun is critical to success in the game.

    <desc>Rockman Deus Ex Machina is one of the best sophisticated hacks in Mega Man II history. It is programmed almost every part of the game you've never expected before. The boss fights are incredibly hyperactive. Players find this hack a clear winner. Background Music is made by the author of Rockman No Constancy IKA. Additional patches were added by Misty in the Japanese 2ch boards about August 8th such as Hard Body and Weapon Modification. A must play for all expert Mega Man II players. Not newbies. Be sure you patch with the Japanese Rockman 2 ROM.

    <desc>Despite the name this is actually a Mega Man 2 hack, which translates it back into Japanese and adds a ton of cool features. To put it simply, this is a new Mega Man 2, the only things that still exist from the original are the robot masters, and even they've been changed in terms of fighting style.

Don't take anything for granted in this hack, those weak rabbit robots in Wood Man's stage? They shoot instant death fireballs now. Sniper Joes? In addition to their normal fighting style they also fire Crash Bombs are you!

It should also be pointed out that the music has been changed, this is very rare in ROM hacks, it seems some of it comes from the Game Boy Mega Man games and some comes from other NES titles.

In this hack, all of the original levels of Rock Man 2 have been totally redesigned as if were Rock Man 1, which includes graphics and music, as well as additional challenge due to more aggressive monsters. The plus version is expected more of a challenge.

    <desc>Rockman 3 Endless is a recreation of Mega Man 9's Endless Attack mode. It is an endurance mode; areas are picked at random, you start at a teleporter and must get to another teleporter at the end of the area. After so many screens you will face a robot master from the original game. You start the game with all of the robot masters' weapons and Rush adapters; your only goal is to survive for as many screens as possible. A similar hack, by the same creator, is also available for Rockman 5.

The version number on this page is based on the time stamp attached to the patch in the archive, as there is no official version number and the hack is updated with new areas often. Dragonsbrethren has an archive site where past versions of the hack can be obtained, which is located here.

    <desc>In celebration of the release of Mega Man IX comes Rock Man Kenk. What is Kenk? It's a modified and polished version of Smart (RM 2 Dash) Apple's unfinished Rock Man Kai. 30% of the original patch was altered and fixed to keep the game's feeling in line of the original game. All the levels have been redesigned and boss fights and weaknesses have been altered. Keep in mind this patch only works on the Japanese Rock Man game.

The Mega Man series tend to be plagued with mods that are littered with cheap hits and unfocused level design. One thing that Kenk attempts to do is stick close enough to the source material in level style and difficulty, but at the same time it changes things up just enough to feel fresh.

It's one of those rare hacks that is meant to be played NES style rather than the savestate way.

    <desc>Rockman No Constancy is a hack of the Rockman 2 game. (Not Megaman 2) This is a well done hack made by IKA (A Japanese ROM hacker), all of the eight robot masters levels seem to be completed and the Dr. Wily stages altered (Finished?). This hack includes a completely new soundtrack, new graphics, altered bosses/weapons, and completely new level layouts. The difficulty level has been ramped up, but not as much as in other Mega Man 2 hacks (at least with the "normal" difficulty IPS patch). The "hard" version of the patch makes the game just about impossible because enemies can continue to hit your character without any 'reflex time". This makes it so once you come in contact with a boss (or one of his projectiles) you have pretty much lost the fight.

Rock 'N' Ball is a pinball game with several gameplay options. The first is regular pinball game for one to four players. The second option is called nineball and the object is to shoot the balls into the playfield and have them land in the holes to form a bingo pattern (i.e. a vertical line, a horizontal line, etc.)

This game is also for one to four players. Next is battle flipper. There is a set of flippers at both the top and bottom of the table, and two players try to knock the pinball past their opponents flippers. Lastly is sports pinball. In this game the pinball table is set up to look like a soccer or hockey field. Similar to battle flipper, each player tries to knock the pinball past their opponents goalie. There is only one flipper in this game, however you have a goalie to block shots and the flipper can be moved from side to side.

Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle.

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history... More for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics.

Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.

A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice. ~ Christopher Michael Baker, All Game Guide

The pinball machine rendered in Rollerball is comprised of four screens, which, by proportion, would be about as long as two standard pinball tables if it were a real table.

The graphics on two of the four screens are based on various aspects of the New York City skyline. The topmost screen (hereafter called the bonus screen) merely shows some clouds and a blimp. The second screen (the main screen) shows the top of the Empire State Building, while the third screen (intermediate) shows the lower skyline and the Statue of Liberty. The lowest (final) screen shows only a blue backdrop, representing the New York sewers.

When roller-skating went out of style with the 1970s, there was a huge void left in the what-to-do-on-Friday-night list of options. No more Couples Only, All Skate, or Limbo Contests. But a few years later, a new skating phenomenon took the world by storm Rollerblading. And that fad has become an institution, as evidenced by the release of ROLLERBLADE RACER for the NES.

Strap on your skates and hit the road as you compete in a variety of events, ranging from Barrel Jumping to Half-Pipe. If you've always wanted to try in-line skating, but it just didn't feel right without the little pom-poms on your skate laces, you can get the full experience with ROLLERBLADE RACER.

Get ready to be rocked, rattled and rolled!

Short on funds for a worldwide terrorist blitz, the underground criminal organization VIPER (Vicious International Punks and Eternal Renegades) has infiltrated RollerGames - the most popular sport of the 21st century. With their greedy sights set on the games' mega prize money, they've corrupted three skating teams and abducted the games' beloved commissioner, Emerson "Skeeter" Bankhead. Now, somewher beneath the city, he sits bound and gagged, at the mercy of these cowardly creeps.

The CIA and FBI lack the speed, cunning and sheer brute force for this job. So it's up to you and your own three teams of free-wheeling skate wizards to rescue the commissioner and stop VIPER from unleashing its venom on the entire city. This is one fight that cannot be fought like a gentleman. You're going to have to take it to the streets, the sewers, the junkyards - just about any place your eight wheels can go (and even a few places they can't).

But even your cat-like reflexes won't guarantee success as you choose and lead your teams through the six muscle-aching stages, all peppered with dastardly deathtraps. Open manholes, greasy oil slicks, combat helicopters and blood-thirsty dogs are just a few of the dangers that await you.

Of course, you'll also have to punch and bodyslam your way pas chop-happy judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and more.

And considering the odds of survival, now might be a good time to hang up your skates and bow out gracefully. But remember, the lives of thousands are hanging in the balance. And if you choose to accept this job and fall flat somewhere along the way, you can count on VIPER to roast your ball bearings for dinner!

--From the NES Roller Games instruction manual.

Overview:

Roller Games is kinda corny, but it's still pretty fun. You have to roller skate around while fighting bad guys, dodging manholes, and jumping large gaps. The controls are simple and the graphics aren't too bad. They are almost just like Contra's graphics. This game also shares it's sounds with Contra. Coming from Konami what do you expect? Roller Games is moderately amusing and a good way to kill a little time, if that's what you're looking for.

Directions:

Skate and fight your way to the end to stop the evil organization VIPER. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Recharge Life
You can recharge your life by repeatedly pressing select.

Spon starting the game, players choose from one of six scenarios that determine the initial layout of power in ancient China. The scenarios loosely depict allegiances and warlord holdings in the novel.

After choosing the scenario, players determine which warlord(s) they will control. Custom characters may be inserted into territories unoccupied by other forces, as well. A total of 41 different provinces exist, as well as over 200 unique characters. Each character has three statistics, which range from 1 to 100 (higher is better). A warlord's Intelligence, War Ability and Charm influence how successful he or she will be when performing certain tasks, such as dueling or increasing land value in a province. The goal of the game is to conquer China. This is accomplished by holding every province on the map.

Gameplay mainly revolves around managing numerical statistics, each representing an attribute of a city or character. For example, a city will have statistics indicating the amount of food stored within its walls, its vulnerability to disasters such as floods and earthquakes, how content the people are, etc. Characters have statistics to reflect his/her fighting prowess, intelligence and loyalty to his/her ruler among other attributes.

Most players will spend more time on improving these statistics than waging war against neighboring territories, as the artificial intelligence of the other rulers tends to be peaceful unless the player attacks them first, or unless they have reached a point of the story where war must break out. Even during such situations, rampant warfare is discouraged. Only editions VII, VIII and X were compounded with RPG aspects, allowing the player to play as a ruler, an adviser, a prefect, a general or a vassal, whereas the player can only control the ruler in other editions. In addition, different characters have various skills to aid them in combat, such as the ability to lure a group of enemy soldiers away from the others or to trick them into retreating.

Retro City Rampage is finally making its long-awaited appearance on Wii tomorrow. However, the WiiWare version of the game comes with a unique bonus: ROM City Rampage, an 8-bit demake of the game.

The entire game had to be rewritten to fit the limitations of an 8-bit experience. However, a new video explains the process behind making the game meet NES spec. Apparently, it involves much more than just throwing some files into WinZIP.

Now you can take the action from the blacktop to the hardwood with ROUNDBALL: 2-On-2 Challenge for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Instead of playing on the playground, the action moves to a full-sized arena, complete with glass backboards and an appreciative crowd watching the action.

This is teamwork at its finest, as you work pick-and-rolls, give-and-go's, and isolation plays that will get you an easy bucket. And if you're open, bury the three-pointer and leave your opponents shaking their heads. You can play alone with a computer-controlled teammate, challenge the computer with a friend, or recruit three friends and go for an all-out four-player game. No matter how you play, the action in ROUNDBALL: 2-On-2 Challenge is fast and furious. It's going to separate the champs from the chumps.

Secret Orders!

Deep behind enemy lines, dozens of American POWs are being held inside a heavily armed base. Your mission is to free the captives and destroy the base. But to get there, you have to make your way through 6 deadly stages.

--From the NES Rush 'n Attack instruction manual.

Overview:

Armed with only a medium combat knife (which Dundee or Rambo would be ashamed to carry) you set out to save the world from legions of fur-lined terrorists! Is the anti-Soviet pun obvious enough?

Directions:

All right, this game wasn't great. Maybe good, though. It has its weaknesses graphically. Some of the background pictures look like they've had more thought put into them than the foreground. The main character is a vaguely man-shaped blue guy (or red in two-player mode).

The bad guys are much more detailed, presumably so you can tell them apart. Some just run at you, some jump at you, some shoot at you. All in good side-scrolling fun. Oh yeah, there's also a yellow guy, apparently on your side since he looks like a yellow clone of yourself and gives you stuff like Bazookas and hand grenades. But I think he may be a double agent, because when you see him he runs, and to get the goods you have to chase him down and stab him.

The sound effects and music are pretty good, but I don't know why you hear the French National Anthem when you clear a stage. Not that I have anything against France or her anthem, but I just think it seems out of place here.

Later in the game you start to get snipers shooting at you from towers, Laser beams mounted on the cieling, and more and more guys running and jumping and generally trying to mow you down, until there's so much stuff that will kill you, it's hard to move at all. Still, if you keep your head and don't get too frustrated, it's pretty fun. Just chuck a grenade, that'll show 'em! 

Controls:

A Button: Fire Special Weapon
B Button: Attack with Knife
Start Button: Start/Pause the Game
Select Button: Choose 1 or 2 Players
Press Down: Climb Ladders/Lie down
Press Up: Climb Ladders/Jump

Hints:

Always Play 2-Player Game
Like most side-scrollers, Rush N Attack has sort of checkpoints so when you die you don't have to start from the beginning. But in this game they are few and far between, so you may end up retracing a lot of your steps if you get killed. However, in two-player mode you start back right where you died, so you don't lose ground. Just let the second player get killed and move on.

You are Rygar, legendary hero of the land of Argool. Wielding your awesome Diskarmer which looks like a shield but works like a twirling yo-yo of death, fight your way through the evil monsters to confront Ligar, the King of Beasts!

This is a really cool game with lots of great features. It is mostly a side-scrolling adventure with occasional vertical scrolling on towers a such. Also some areas have an overhead view where the action is somewhat different. There are also a lot of power-ups and items for Rygar to find which will help you progress through the game.

Directions:

Pressing the Start button brings up the sub-menu which is pretty confusing at first. The box on the left contains TONE which refers to the strength of Rygar's weapon, LAST which refers to his durability, and MIND which refers to capsules of spiritual power which Rygar can pick up from enemies.

TONE and LAST will increase as Rygar defeats his enemies, making his weapon stronger, and when LAST reaches a high enough number Rygar gains another bubble on his energy meter (Life, hit points, whatever you want to call it). MIND capsules look like stars on the screen after you kill an enemy. You can hold up to seven capsules, and use them from the sub-menu on the right side, Potential. Choose Power Up which makes Rygar's weapon reach longer and costs 3 capsules, Attack and Assail which allows Rygar to temporarily damage every enemy on screen when he uses his weapon (costs 5), or Recover which fills up Rygar's life (costs 7). The boxes at the bottom of the sub-menu hold items Rygar can pick up in the game. On the right are items he can use all the time, on the left are items he can use from the sub-menu. Select the item and press B to use it.

Press down to crouch (lots of your enemies are low to the ground). Press up or down to climb ropes. Some enemies can be stunned by jumping on them. In case of flying enemies, remember you can attack while jumping or climbing.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Display Sub-menu
Select Button: Pause the game

Hints:

Life Meter
Build up your life meter at the beginning of the game instead of waiting to gradually kill enough enemies. On the first stage, find a place where you can put your back to a wall (or a pit will do but if you goof you get knocked in and die). With enemies coming from only one side, you can just keep attacking until you get your life meter filled up. After that it's easier and safer to avoid most of the enemies you'll meet. This takes a while but it's worth it, and since Console Classix lets you save your game, you'll only ever have to do it once!

    <desc>Sanrio Carnival is just a hodge-podge of various puzzle games, such as "falling candy of doom," and "rearrange the picture" (better known to some as "Columns," and "Major Annoyance"). But, it throws in all those loveable Sanrio characters, which makes up for it being a mediocre game. Playing against the computer is entirely boring. However, finding another human player may inject some added fun. But then again, finding another person to play Nitendo is a game unto itself :-P

Translation Description:

The translation is complete! And the title screen is kewl.

    <desc>This is a great game. As the name implies, it's a volley ball game with Sanrio characters. Which instantly makes it fun. You basically hit the volley ball back and forth until someone misses it or hits it out of bounds. Simple? Yes! But still very fun. You also may have heard a rumor that that Kunio Volley Ball game kicks this game's ass in. Well, that rumor is just wrong. Sorry Kunio. Well-played, but you just FELL SHORT. This is the real thing folks. Because it's Sanrio. PLay it! It is commanded of you!

Translation Description:

In playtesting, I thought I found a couple of untranslated commentator things, but maybe I just dreamed it one night. And if I say so myself, the signs totally suck. Apart from that, it's a great game and it's in English. Go play the game now.

It is now the 21st Century. High frequency radio and television communications between Planet Earth and the space-exploring Saturn Space Station blast warn- ings of approaching invaders, then abruptly cease.

You shed your earthly identity to become the one remaining astronaut in space. You unite with freedom-fighter Captain Commando to enter the outer regions of space. Concealed in a special solar-energized, jet-propelled supersonic space- suit, and armed with multi-directional weaponry, you depart Earth's surface on a death-defying mission.

You and Captain Commando must maneuver safely through four levels of adventurous battle scenes, penetrating the defenses established by the Space Soldiers of Balangool. You are challenged as you fight through Sections A to Section Z - where "L-Brain", Balangool's Master Control, programs domination of the universe.

Your goal: penetrate Section Z, destroy L-Brain Master Control, defeat the evil Space Soldiers of Balangool, and save Planet Earth.

L-Brain, Master Control of Balangool, secured in Section Z of Fortress Balan- gool, headquarters of this brutal enemy force, transmits communiques through- out the universe. Balangool Space Soldiers receive instructions from L-Brain while engaged in interplanetary invasions. Their goal is to conquer the universe.

Balangool Captains are stationed at each stage, guarding giant superpowered transmitters. Strong, red barriers surround two transmitters found at Stage One. To clear these red barriers you must destroy the Enemy Generator supply- ing power to the barriers. Should you successfully eliminate the generator, proceed to eradicate the Balangool Captain. For only then can you proceed to another Stage.

As you progress, increase your supply of weapons and energy. Without them, you cannot reach Section Z to bring L-Brain Master Control to extinction, hero- ically saving Planet Earth.

--From the NES Section Z instruction manual.

Overview:

A fast-paced side-scrolling shooter, Section Z takes you into Fortress Balangool, where you will fight your way through to challenge L-Brain, and, presumably, save the universe. Or just get killed. A lot.

Directions:

Captain Commando wears a pink suit with silvery wings, and he flies up and down shooting at the infinite number of enemies which infest Balangool. Fortunately, he can shoot in both directions, so you can do something about the guys coming up from behind.

On the other hand, you move pretty slowly until you find some power-ups that can boost your speed, but the screen moves at the same pace pretty much no matter what you do. Be careful not to get caught behind a wall.

Energy
The energy/hit point system is bizzarely complicated, but here's my understanding: you start out with 20 Energy (this initial maximum can be increased with power-ups left behind by bosses). Getting hit by enemy fire costs 1 point of energy for most attacks, but crashing into an enemy or getting stuck behind a wall when the screen moves on, causes "instant death." After death you will be returned some distance back from where you died, with 5 less energy. You can pick up eergy capsules from defeated enemies, to replenish your energy. When you drop to zero energy, you are drawn back to the latest checkpoint, which are at sections 0, 20, and 40.

Weaponry
You start with a Laser weapon, but you may pick up better weapons as you go through the game. As you pick up weapons, letters representing each one appear in the upper right of the screen. Push Right to choose the weapon you want, and push Select to equip it. Be aware that your current equipped weapon is lost when you die. The weapon upgrades are Barrier Shield, Flash Buster (a slow three-way cannon), and Mega Smasher (a fast, most powerful gun). You may also choose to use a Special Transmission Shell (STS) which costs 5 energy units. The default STS is a very slow but powerful missile, but you can get upgrades which allow you to choose other STS weapons such as a bomb which damages all enemies on-screen. Press A + B to invoke the STS, press it again to cycle through your choices, then pick it up and fire like any other weapon. 

Controls:

A Button: Fire Right
B Button: Fire Left
A + B: Use STS
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Use Special Weapon

Hints:

Mega Buster
Ordinarily you can't use more than one type of weapon at once. However, if you use the Mega Smasher and have an extra Mega Smasher and a Flash Buster in your inventory, you will be able to use a three-way shot Mega Buster.

Here on the planet Colura lived two different tribes. One was the Petras, a highly civilized tribe. Another was the Basrah, a vicious tribe. The larger Basrah all of a sudden declared war on the Petras. The Petras were very civilized, and were pacifists who did not possess enough arms and weapons to protect themselves against the Basrah's attack. They were quickly driven underground without much resistance. A handful of the Petras were left and a few ex-captives who barely escaped from the Basrah were waiting to be rescued. Finally the Petras developed a mini-size rescue bike which they called Gilgitt Petras. They blasted off on Gilgitt Petras from their secret hideout to rescue the Petras who still remained behind.

Race your bike along thrilling backgrouns as you battle alien enemies. The serenity of the space city is broken as players blast off into space from the gate in order to save their people who are left in the battlefield.

Sesame Street's Count von Count stars in this educational game where the point is to learn how to identify numbers. You can choose to either hop or run across the levels trying to collect as many examples of the number of the day required for that particular level. The number of the day is selected randomly by a spinning number wheel. The only way to lose in the game is to touch the incorrect numbers (numbers other than the one you are required to find) which will drain your life bar. There are also two bonus levels that involve using counting and addition/subtraction skills.

As the last of the Line of Kings, only you possess the power to prevent the evil Warlock Lord from raising the Behemoth and unleashing it upon the land. Your quest lies within the Castle Shadowgate with its secret passageways, collapsing floors, and armed creatures. Your courage and wisdom will see you through... but a good sword might be helpful.

--From the NES Shadowgate instruction manual.

Overview:

Shadowgate was a very cool point and click game. The graphics were very good because they were almost all still. Shadowgate was super hard though. This was one of the few games that would actually let you do something that would make it impossible to complete the game. It was very much a thinking game. There were a lot of puzzles to figure out. I don't think I actually ever beat the game when I was younger. I found a walkthrough for it a couple of years ago and beat it though. If you play it I suggest that you look at everything, and maybe even try to use it. You have to hurry though, if you run out of torches for light, your game will be over. Shadowgate was a great idea for a game and I reccomend you give it a try.

Directions:

You must explore the depths of the castle and prevent the evil Warlock Lord from bring darkness upon the land. 

Controls:

A Button: Click
B Button: None
Start Button: Start/Hints
Select Button: Hints

Hints:

Strange Torch
In the game you will find a weird torch that you can't light, use it on the wraith and it will destroy him.

The year is 2026, and things have apparently changed in the good old U.S. of A. As one of two "Shadow Ninjas," or both if you play together with a friend, your job is to liberate New York City from the evil Emperor Garuda.

Pretty good graphis, and decent music. Overall a worthwhile game, so give it a spin!

Directions:
Side scrolling beat-em-up, anyone? This one's pretty good, I must say. Not too simple, not too complicated, not too thumb-defyingly hard. Lots of different enemies that don't make you feel like you're just fighting different pictures that are really all the same. You can pick up different weapons that change the power and range of your attacks. There are throwing stars, a morning star on a chain, and you can get up to three swords which become stronger and reach farther.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Start, Pause
Select Button: Choose character

Hints:

Summon Lightning
Hold down B for a few seconds to summon lighting bolts to kill all enemies on the screen. However, this takes away about half of your life.

In the year 2030, medical technology develops to a point where missing limbs can be replaced with "cybernetic" devices that replicate human movement and form with great precision. Working on a top secret military project, a large group of scientists create military uses for these new cybernetic limbs. Within that group of scientists, a handful of subversives unite. With world domination as their goal, these subversives collaborate covertly to create an army of cyborg soldiers. General Gus Grover emerges as the leader of the group, and, after plans are carefully made and an awesome assembly of cyborgs stands at the ready, the group begins open revolt. They become known as the Metal Command.

To combat the revolutionary movement, the Law and Order Regulatory Division is formed (L.O.R.D.). They put another group of scientists together to come up with something to combat the cyborgs of the Metal Command. What comes of this group's research and development is a very special pair of hands.

These cybernetic attachments give their recipient the strength of a piledriver. They are capable of shattering metal on impact. There's only one problem. Without a willing recipient, these powerful hands cannot be used against the Metal Command.

Meanwhile, in the Bronx, a young and highly decorated police officer named Steve Hermann chases after one of the Metal Command's cyborgs. The cyborg slows down, allowing Hermann to catch up. Hermann is puzzled by the apparent cooperation of the cyborg, until he hears the crunch of metal on concrete behind him. He turns just in time to see a huge cyborg close in. Hermann becomes a human sandwich between the two mighty cyborgs. They pull apart to determine if Hermann is still alive, and despite crushed hands and ribs, Hermann manages to run to freedom.

Several days later, after both of his completely crushed and mutilated hands have been amputated, a L.O.R.D. official approaches Hermann's hospital bed with a package under his arm. He identifies himself and opens the package. He picks up the contents and displays them to Hermann: a pair of cybernetic hands - the strongest hands in the world.

Now more motivated against the Metal Command than ever, Steve Hermann accepts the cybernetic hands and the responsibility that goes with them. The cybernetic hands are attached, and Hermann spends the next two months recovering from his injuries. When he emerges from the hospital, he will be known only as "Shatterhand" to protect his true identity. His mission: crush the rebellion with his bare hands.

    <desc>Yet another Dragon Warrior/Quest clone. In this, you take the role of a generic hero... who wears a shell on his back; I assume it's a turtle shell. And you have to look for three other beings (monsters) that also have shells on their backs so you can all save the world.

So yes, it is a generic RPG storyline. The game is a generic RPG. The battles are quite tough, though. The first few fights will be frustrating at the very least, because even the weakest enemies need at least three turns -each- to be killed, and you start the game alone. The music's decent, and the graphics are kinda simple when you're in the overworld, but the monsters look allright, and they change a bit when they're almost defeated.

Translation Description:

This is a complete translation aside from a few minor graphical glitches. It uses the Namcot 106 mapper (iNES mapper #19). The patch works only on the properly dumped Japanese ROM. I believe this is Kaijyu Monogatari (J). You will need to expand the Japanese ROM from 256KB to 384KB before applying the patch. Consult the readme for further information.

    <desc>This is an infuriating puzzle game. It wastes no time in holding your hand through the first few, you know, letting you understand the game's intricacies. Therefore, all of these screenshots are from the game's first level, cause I really don't want to bother with it. The manual included in the zip doesn't help either. Well anyways, all the screenshots look different because you have three different "themes" that you can use. I like the ninja cause he crawls around and he's funny. Hahaha! That's all.

Translation Description:

Seeing as how no one has ever beaten this game, like, ever, we can only assume that the game is completely translated. So yay.

Update: There are Kanji's in the ending that are left untranslated.

    <desc>Yep, Dragon Quest clone. This has a lot more promise than others that I've seen, only because the intro's pretty cool, and I'm a sucker for stuff with an Eastern influence. Yeah, so go Shinsenden! Whee!

Translation Description:

Another "oriental" style Role Playing Game for NES.  Please, check README (at website) and feel free to take a look at the complementary Info file, if you have some time and knowledge.

The Tarian race has long since died out, and would be just as long forgotten, were it not for the relics of power they left behind. An amazing warp suit, that allows movement through the dimensions, and the shockwave pistol, delivering tremendous bursts of energy. This energy is derived from special crystals, of which few remain. Rastons, ancient enemies of the Tarians, have returned to claim these relics. They have employed a dimension field generator to create a rift in space and time. The Tarian relics are the only chance of destroying the generator and sealing the tear... You have been chosen! Donning the warp suit and pistol, you must use the few remaining crystal shards to power your journey through the rift. You must solve the riddle of the mazes to defeat the generator and seal the rift. Tarian legends speak of mazes without end. Keep your wits about you! Return quickly, our universe is counting on you!

Think you have what it takes to be the fastest gun in the west? How about the ace of outer space? You'll need a quick draw, a steady hand, and a dead eye to prove your stuff in this fast paced test of sharpshooting skill. But remember when all is said and done, in Shooting Range, you're either a hot shot or your not.

One of a handful of games designed exclusively for use with Nintendo's Power Pad (a floor mat with 12 large, touch-sensitive buttons), Short Order/Eggsplode for the NES features two games in one Game Pak. Short Order has you working in a hamburger shop, trying to please customers by building their burgers (which consist of meat, cheese, lettuce and tomato) in the same sequence in which they were ordered.

When an animal comes into the shop, he will order a hamburger with three ingredients; then he will keep adding an ingredient with each successive turn. The bigger the animal, the more ingredients he will eventually want on his hamburger. For example: mice are satisfied with their order at 10 ingredients while pigs keep going until they have ordered 99 ingredients. In two-player mode, one player assumes the role of a fox while the other plays a dog. Contestants take turns ordering hamburger ingredients until one player gets the sequence wrong three times.

In Eggsplode, a scheming fox has sneaked into the chicken coop and is looking to raise some ruckus with the hens by planting bombs under them. The hens' nests are laid out in the same sequence (4x3) as the spaces on the Power Pad. When a fox plants a bomb under a chicken, you must step on that bomb. When the game begins, there is one fox with 10 bombs, but as the game wears on and gets faster, it progresses up to three foxes with 60 bombs.

    <desc>I used to get a kick outta playing shufflepuck on the Macs at my High School, it was about the only "game" they had, so I grew quite addicted to it =]. Hence I love this game, seedy Sci-Fi plot and all.

If you're not aware what shuffle puck is, it's a lot like air hockey: there's a flat playing surface with a "puck." The two players sit at opposite ends of the table, and use a paddle to hit the puck back and forth across the table until it slips by one of the players, which scores them a point. This game is very good at re-creating that. In fact, too good . . . I can't beat a single person at it to be honest =P. It's almost like the computer is reading my moves!! If you happen to be addicted to shufflepuck against your will (like I was), you'll enjoy this game. If you like games that are virtually impossible to beat, you'll love it. Other wise . . . well . . . some things are better left unsaid.

Yup, totally in English! Haha, have fun kids.

Side Pocket is probably the best pool game for the NES. It is a lot more like real pool than most pool games on the NES, like Lunar Pool. You have a series of levels to clear, and a number of trick shots to preform in order to beat the game. Once you get the hang of it, it's not too hard. This was the first pool game for the NES with the ability to put english on the ball that I ever played. Side Pocket is one of the best pool games on the NES, so if you like pool, be sure to check this out!

Directions:

Play the best game of pool you can. 

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: English
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

English
The english in this game is a little touchy, so be sure not to put that much.

Find 'em, chase 'em, sink 'em!

Just above the beat of your heart, you hear hostile propellors churning through calm seas. At any second the first depth charge will explode. Your watch ticks. Sweat rolls into your eyes. As the enemy's sonar ping intensifies you hold your breath, realizing that the pressure of an unmerciful sea is all around you.

Such is your life as a commander in the elite Silent Service Force, a detailed simulation of World War II submarine missions in the bloody South Pacific.

From the moment you dive into action, you'll be confronted with the same information, problems and resources available to an actual sub captain. Your primary mission will be to take on the Japanese Navy in their home waters and to neutralize the Japanese Merchant Merine.

With a limited number of torpedoes and fuel, your goal is to sink a maximum tonnage of enemy ships and bring your sub safely back to base. Your overall evaluation from Fleet Command will be based on the number and types of ships you sink.

So go get 'em commander. Your crew is counting on you... because they know if you fail, they'll become instant shark bait!

Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).

Important note before you start playing:

The game was dumped very badly so DELETE ALL THE SAVE FILES ON THE TITLE SCREEN, THEN CHOOSE AN EMPTY ONE! If you don't do that, you'll stuck in the middle of nowhere!!!!!!!!

The Silver Surfer roams throughout space as herald to Galactus, looking for new planets for him to feed on. However his mission is interrupted by a summon from Galactus. Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.

Hello, fellow humans! Bartholomew J. Simpson here, with a very important secret: SPACE MUTANTS ARE INVADING SPRINGFIELD!

That's right, man! A buncha slimy, horrible, totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet!

Pretty cool, huh?

Anyway, yours truly is the only one who can see 'em 'cause of my X-Ray glasses - so it's up to me to stop 'em! I've gotta spraypaint things, get radical on my skateboard, use my trusty slingshot and in general, behave like a nuisance, man.

Plus, with evil dudes like Nelson the bully and Sideshow Bob getting in my way, it's a good thing I've got the rest of the Simpsons to help me out! So if you're a decent person, a patriot and somebody who cares about this sorry planet, you'll do the right thing. Save the Earth! PLAY THIS GAME!
Thanks, man.

--From the NES Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants instruction manual.

Overview:

You are Bart Simpson, and you must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield! The Space Mutants plan to create a machine that will help take over Springfield, but this wont happen if you, Bart Simpson, can paint or hide all purple items before the Space Mutants can find them!

Directions:

In this side-scroller game, you are to hide or paint anything that is purple, but you must be careful and not to touch an alien, because they will hurt you if you do.

Controls:

A Button: Jump/Run
B Button: Spray Paint
Start Button: Selects Menu Item
Select Button: Scrolls through Menu Items

Hints:

Access Sound Test
In Level 1, stand to the right of the 'E' on the 'Quick-E-Mart' sign. Shoot one of your rockets at the 'E' to make a Krusty Clown Face appear that gives you three extra lives and a Sound Test.

Apparently Krusty the Clown and Montgomery Burns have teamed up to sponsor an art contest. The winner gets to take a treasure hunt around the world to collect cool Krusty merchandise. And of course, who is chosen as the winner but our little hero, Bart Simpson. But Mr. Burns's plans aren't on the level. He wants to use this chance to wipe out Bart and his family once and for all! So take a trip around the world with the Simpsons, find the treasure, and avoid being wasted by Burn's creepy cousins in foreign lands.

    <desc>In February 2001, we celebrate NES game "Bart vs. The Space Mutants' 10 years of existance... My way to celebrate this was to produce a game hack. If you played "Swamp Thing", will realize that the sounds and playability of that game are very similar to Simpsons games - the authors are the same. So, I hacked Swamp Thing and made "The Simpsons - Return of the Space Mutants" I changed the characters, backgrounds and text.

You and your skateneck buddies spend your days ripping the streets, looking for fun, hurting nobody. You got tunes in your box, chili fries in your mouth, and a rad ramp in your backyard. Life is sweet.

Then one fine day, you're tearing down the sidewalk when you accidentally run over the mayor's wife's poodle. Splat. The dog is pushing up daisies and Mrs. Mayor is foaming at the mouth. She goes on a psycho anti-skate rampage and forces her old man -- a nice but regrettably spineless bureaucrat -- to dig up a law that condemns your ramp to the scrap heap. Whaddya do?! You gotta build a new ramp by legal means. To do this, you gotta go through 4 levels in search of bucks for the building permit and plans for the ramp. Get through all 4 levels and it's competition time on the wicked Double Trouble Half-Pipe.

--From the NES Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble instruction manual.

Overview:

According to the story, the Mayor has banned skateboards because you killed his wife's dog. Seems a bit unusual, because when you actually start playing Skate or Die 2, every single person you see is riding a skateboard. In any case, ride around town collecting CDs, tapes and food to buy better boards from Rodney and learn new tricks from Lester. These are, of course, the lovable characters from Skate or Die 1, and since you beat down Lester he's now on your side, or at least willing to help you for some kool music or chili cheese fries.

Now it's time to make the streets safe for innocent skaters in your town, by taking out the mayor's wife, and the rude and abusive skateboard gang led by Ice Pick. Good luck!

WELCOME TO A RAD INFESTED WORLD

There's a place on Earth where hot dogs and nachos are health foods, summer vacations last the year round, and punk rockers with mohawk haircuts are looked upon as mello dudes. It's a place where rulers are determined not by their fund raising talents, but by their power to dominate the streets with rad skateboarding skills.

Here, the king of the road is none other than that skateboarding maniac - Rodney Recloose, owner of the Flesh 'N Asphalt Skateboard Shoppe. He, along with his freaked-out son, Bionic Lester, and their crazed cronies, Pete and Eddie, rule the streets with iron wheels. They're sort of a nuclear waste version of Al Capone and his once ruthless gang of gangsters.

As a newcomer on the scene, with power aspirations of your own, you must prove yourself to Rodney and his free-wheeling weirdos. That means you'd better be on your toes when you challenge friends in free-style and downhill competitions packed with rock 'n rolls and rail slides. And you'd better be on your worst behavior when you come board-to-board with Lester in the "whack 'em upside the head" joust!

--From the NES Skate or Die instruction manual.

Overview:

If you were a skater in the late 80's, chances are you owned this game. Skate or Die was produced by Konami but published by Ultra Games, and it turned out to be a really fun skating game. You play as yourself and your main goal is to rip up your competition to gain top dog status on the streets. Your main enemy is actually the son of the skateshop owner, Rodney Recloose. Rodney's not so bad but his son Lester is a dolt and he'll try to thwart your efforts to be the best.

Directions:

Get totally gnarly on your board and thrash your opposition, dude! Ugh, I'm going to be sick; nostalgia overdose. 

Against Lester and his cronies, or even one of your friends, you can compete or practice in 5 events. Freestyle is my favorite, which is just the old school term for vert ramp. Then you've got High Jump, which is basically the vert ramp with a ruler attached to the coping. Jam is kind of a downhill obstacle course that can get really annoying because it doesn't really matter how many times you mess up, as long as it's not at the end. Race is what it says, but be careful because the controls get a little hairy in this mode. Joust is a total rip-off of American Gladiators but with an X-Treme twist. 

Hints:

Jam Win
If you want to win the Jam event, just play it ultra safe at the end and make no mistakes. Because the computer always keeps you in close competition with Lester, a perfect end will win the event for you.

You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.

It is the middle of WW2 and you're part of the famous fighter squadron the "Flying Tigers." Basically, you are in the middle of nowhere deep in enemy territory. It's just you and your plane, and you guessed it, your plane is called the "Sky Shark".

Gameplay will start slow, but it gets better. Oh, and don't expect any friendly fighters, because you are on your own. This is a pretty simple fly and shoot game. Graphics are good for '89, you can tell they are planes. If you're in to WORLD WAR II games, you will enjoy this one.

Directions:

Guide your plane through each level and destroy the enemy. The main thing you have to do to complete each level is that you have to keep moving. You have two different weapons on your plane that you can use. Against other planes, use your missiles. For this weapon, you have unlimited ammo, so don't worry about conserving ammo. As you play the game, you can upgrade this weapon's rate of fire and damage. For every enemy you shoot down, you get points, and you can use them to get the upgrades. Your other weapon is a bomb, drop this on land forces such as tanks and troop transports. You do have to conserve these, because you have a limited number of bombs you can use. You can upgrade this bomb to increase its damage and the amount of ammo you are given. Each enemy is a different amount of points. Use the points to get upgrades.

Controls:

A Button: DROP BOMB
B Button: FIRE MISSILES
Start Button: START, PAUSE
Select Button: N/A

You wake up on a wintry morning and decide to go skiing. You then get in your car and drive to the slopes. When you arrive, the person at the ski shop tells about the upcoming ski competition. You went ahead and registered. Finally, the day has come for you to test your skills against other experienced skiers.

The first thing you see when you load the game is the title screen with the usual copyright info. Press Start and you get to choose the number of players and the mountain that you want to challenge. The scarier-sounding the name, the more difficult the peak is. Once you press start, the map of the area appears and the game starts. You first start off on the qualifying round, which lets you improve your skills for later parts. One thing, you have to make it to the end before time is up. Remember to watch out for trees and other skiers.

I really like this game. The controls are simple to remember and are smooth. Another thing I like is the game is based on time trials. The only thing that bothers me is that a lot of things get in my when when I'm playing.

Directions:

Race against the time while skiing down three slopes. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Jump
Start Button: Pause Game
Select Button: Select Peak

Hints:

Prevent Yourself from Falling Down
Press Down right after you flip up in the air.

The year is 1999.

Television has given in to the blood lust of its viewers. Violence tops the ratings.

TV game shows now offer the ultimate in prizes: your life! Winning and losing has become kill or be killed.

One show in particular stands as the biggest, most spectacular, most gruesome and most rewarding contest of all: SMASH TV.

Alone or in a pair, powerfully armed contestants are sent into a closed arena. There, before a live studio audience and devoted TV viewers from around the globe, they battle opponents - human, humanoid, and inhuman - and search out the cash and prizes that will make them Smash TV Grand Champions.

Ready for prime time?

The future is now.

You are the next lucky contestant.

--From the NES Smash TV instruction manual.

Overview:

You are a contestant on Smash TV, a violent contest where you must survive and arena, in which tons of beasts and killer robots enter the room from all sides, all with one goal, and that is to kill you.

The purpose of the game is to shoot everything that comes towards you, and to try to grab as many prizes and cash that you see, while surviving in the Arena. Will you win or die on Smash TV?

Directions:

In this game, you must avoid getting hit by the people, who will beat you with a stick if they get too close. They will be coming from all sides. You will need to simply shoot them.

While you are in fighting to survive in the arena, you can pick up objects to earn more points. Some will even give you a power up, such as a better weapon, or even protection stars (stars that rotate around you and kill any enemy that it touches). 

Controls:

A Button: Shoot/Changes Direction
B Button: Shoots
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: N/A

Hints:

Level Select
Up (controller 1, for selecting # of players); hold Down + B (controller 2); press Start (controller 1)

    <desc>This release (20090219) is the second official beta test of the Super Mario Bros. Special for NES port. SMBS is a SMB based game licensed by Nintendo and created by Hudson Soft for the Japanese PC8801 computer. It was later ported to the Sharp X1. However, beyond these (now) obscure platforms, it was largely ignored and forgotten until suddenly becoming a cult hit in the emulation scene.

The game became notorious for it's fiendish difficulty and it's (unusual for a Mario game) use of single screens rather than smooth scrolling. The suggestion was made to give the game a facelift and expose it to a wider audience by porting it to the NES. This is the result of that effort.

The evil Gargamel has captured three of the smurfs, so that he can have them for dinner (Once again). One of the smurfs must go out on a dangerous journey and rescue the captured smurfs. Beat the first two bosses to rescue the first two smurfs, then you can take on Gargamel. Make your way through forests, swamps, mountains, mines and more. Also ride storks, mine carts and logs to defeat Gargamel and his minions and to rescue the missing smurfs.

On each level you must collect five stars in order to get access to the bonus level. (You don't have to collect the five stars in order to get through the main level) On the bonus level, try to collect as many bonuses as possible before the time runs out. There are three bonus levels: "The Dam", "The Mushrooms" and "The Butterflies".

Snake Rattle N Roll takes you into the fun filled world of two of the hippest snakes around --- Rattle and Roll! You must work you way through 11 levels of wacky landscapes and wild enemies. In each level you need to consume enough Nibbley Pibbleys to activate the scale that will open the door to the next area. Good Luck!

--From the NES Snake Rattle 'n Roll instruction manual.

Overview:

As a couple of little snakes called Rattle and Roll, your mission is to crawl, jump, and eat your way through 11 levels of checkerboard landscapes, waterfalls, and an assortment of wierd enemies.

Directions:

This is a pretty neat little action/puzzle game. Your basic goal is to eat the little round things called Pibbleys, by flicking your tongue at them. When you eat enough, your snake grows an extra segment on its tail. You have to have a certain number of segments to complete each level. There is a "scale" which you must hop on, and if you weigh enough it rings the bell which opens the door to the next level. As well as Pibbleys there are lots of other things to eat. Most enemies require several consecutive tongue flicks to kill, and some can't be killed at all. Many of them drop extra lives or other good stuff when you kill them. You can't always do everything, though, because you have a time limit, so be careful. Some power-ups you can find include tongue extensions, clocks that give you extra time, and a diamond that gives temporary invincibility. Look for Lids on the ground, open them up and see what's inside, it may be an enemy, a power-up, or even a bonus level!

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Flick Toungue, Swim, Open Lids
Start Button: Start/Pause Game
Select Button: Choose 1 or 2 Players

Hints:

Rocket Warp
As soon as the game begins on level 1, run to the right as fast as you can, jump to avoid enemies, you have to be really fast. At the end of the board there is a rocket, if you jump on it in time it takes you to level 8.

Level 3 Warp
Also on level 1, go to the first little island with no lid on it. If you get on it and tap B a few times you'll find a hidden lid that warps you to level 3.

The Silly Sports are being held in it's traditional home of Italy and Snoopy, from the Peanuts comic strips, will want to attend. Snoopy packs his plane and brings along his relative, Spike as an opponent and the little yellow bird, Woodstock to judge.

Now Snoopy's ready to compete with 1 or 2 players in his own custom olympiad of the following "events":

1. The Sack Race: Snoopy and Spike race against one another in competing potato sacks.

2. Boot Throwing: Just like the Hammer toss, but involving an old boot.

3. Pogo: Hop on a Pogo Stick and hop over obstacles.

4. Overboard: Snoopy and Spike play "King of the Boat" trying to knock each other into the water.

5. Pile of Pizza: Balance the pizzas while trying to walk towards the finish line.

6. River Jump: Pole Vault over the river (actually sticking the pole into the river) to the other side.

The Japanese version of this game uses a Donald Duck license rather than a Snoopy license (changing many of the character names above), but gameplay remains the same.

Nick and Tom are two Princes living the dream with two beautiful princesses. When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.

    <desc>Softball Heaven plays just like every other Nes baseball game. Except this one is actually fun because you get to play as all sorts of strange animals, mythical figures, and whatnot. You can even be Mike Tyson! Also, there are a bunch of different fields to play on, each with it's own house rules. Softball Heaven is about as fun as baseball is going to get on the Nes, so you should give it a shot. But then again, Sunday Funday is about as fun the Bible is going to get on the Nes, so I guess that isn't the best reasoning ? aw hell, just play the damn game.

Translation Description:

Can you imagine having to translate all those stupid names? Bleh. Anyway the game's complete, even though the title screen kinda sucks.

The Golden Warpship was once the most powerful spacecraft in Solar Jetman's galactic fleet. But that was before alien space pirates shipnapped the vessel on its last mission. The Warpship now lies disassembled and hidden throughout the galaxy, with Solar Jetman the only remaining hope for its recovery.

This will be no easy task for our interplanetary hero. Solar Jetman must search through twelve menacing alien worlds in his quest to rebuild the Golden Warpship. Each one filled with savage alien armies, black holes, extreme gravitational forces, warp zones and deadly booby traps. Once Solar Jetman has reconstructed the Warpship, he can forge ahead to meet the final challenge awaiting him.

Long, long ago the world was in a state of chaos, where demons caused evil &amp; tormented all. That changed when Solomon, a great king &amp; magician, invented a magical formula which he wrote inside a secret book called "Solomon's Key". This book arrested and sealed away all evil demons into a constellation sign which was hidden. "Solomon's Key" restored light and peace to the world. Upon hearing this legend, a taoist monk searched for a long period of time to find "Solomon's Key". After locating the constellation sign, he discovers the "Key". Once in his grasp many dreadful demons were freed from the magical power of this book. The world was brought back to chaos and darkness. Everything on earth was now under control by the demons just like the pre-creation days. King Yutra from the fairyland called "Lyrac", ordered the wizard, Dana to restore order back to the world. Dana accepted this mission and stepped into the forbidden land of the "Constellation Sign".

The quest for the staff of Demnos

As the full moon rose high above Kastlerock on the eve of the winter solstice, Morbius the Malevolent grinned a wicked grin and continued to ready the impending ritual, the sacrifice of a helpless damsel to the forces of darkness in return for total domination of the world. But this was no simple girl, he thought in his black and twisted mind, this was the beautiful Princess Eleanor of Arcadia, the land of his sworn enemy. It was too perfect, too perfect.

Not even that accursed Staff of Demnos could stand in his way now. For years his spies had used every conceivably horrible method to find it, and if they could not succeed, surely no one else would. Besides, with or without the magic Staff, his evil plans would succeed. With or without it, he would become the supreme symbol of evil, the Black Baron of Darkness. Then all would be forced to grovel at his feet. And he would plunge the world into a deathly darkness from which it would never return. Everything was prepared. Nothing could stop him now!

The fearsome fortress of Kastlerock had long been the stronghold of Morbius the Malevolent. Built high atop a tremendous cliff of jagged rock, rising straight up from the Sea of Sorrows, the castle had withstood the onslaught of many great armies over the centuries.

Rumors of secret halls and rooms protected by deadly black magic and ferocious man eating beasts had entered the legends of old by the few fortunate prisoners who had escaped Morbius' torturous clutches. They trembled while talking of the dreaded Caves of the Doomed Souls, an endless labyrinth of catacombs carved out of the shear rock cliff far beneath the castle walls. The words crept from their tongues when they spoke of the four deadly towers of the main castle, as if with a mere mention they could be transported back by some of Morbius' evil black magic.

Brave men cowered in fear when they heard the terrible tales of torture in the Gardens of Pain and the Blood Gardens just to the west of the castle. Women and children wept when told of the grisly horrors that befell the unsuspecting who wandered aimlessly through the Slaughter Yards that protected the Tower of Tears at the northernmost boundary of Kastlerock. And few words could describe the hideous screams of terror from the foolhardy who mistakenly tumbled into the Mines of Insanity, never to be heard from again.

But, no stories could compare with those of the eastern grounds of the castle where the Tower of Ultimate Terror stood surrounded by the gruesome Stonehedge Gardens whose massive walls were said to be made from the crushed bones of Morbius' unfortunate victims. Of the Tower itself, little was known. Many believed that it was the site of Morbius' secret workshop; such an overwhelming sense of fear hung about its walls. Certainly, it was the source of his evil powers; as for many days now a black cloud could be seen pouring forth from it, spreading across the land, and choking off the last hopeful rays of the sun.

The old sorcerer Shadax stood at the foot of the great cliff of Kastlerock and stared into the blackness above. Having sailed unseen across the Sea of Sorrows, he now set his mind firmly on the task at hand. He knew a secret way into the castle, a way unknown to even Morbius himself. He'd discovered it by carefully translating the ancient rune maps and poetry he'd found in the Library of the Oracles in far off Arcadia. But he knew getting in was the least of his worries. After all, Morbius would never expect that someone would actually want to get into Kastlerock.

Hopefully, his disguise would provide him with the element of surprise he so needed. After all, who would suspect that an old man could cause any trouble in such a deadly powerful place. But he was not the withered old beggar he appeared. His true identity remained safely concealed beneath his tattered cloak and hat, and there it would stay until he possessed the strength he needed to confront Morbius. For powerful as Shadax was, he was still no match for the vast forces of darkness growing daily in the hands of the evil Baron. For this task he needed the strongest of allies; he needed the awesome power of the Staff of Demnos.

According to legend, this magical Staff had been forged long long ago in the mystical fires of the mythical Elf Kingdom of Old Earth. And legend had it that he who possessed this mighty weapon, would rule Heaven and Earth. How it had wound up in the hands of mankind is a tale far too long to tell here, but in the wise hands of the Ancient kings of Arcadea, it had provided centuries of peace and prosperity.

However, many years ago, for fear that it would fall into Morbius' increasingly powerful grip, the Staff had been beoken into six pieces, a spell of invisibility had been cast upon them, and they were scattered to the far corners of the continent. But, once again Shadax knew something his enemy did not.

If the ancient rune poems were true, the pieces of the staff had been hidden in the last place Morbius would ever think to look: in his own castle. And only once every hundred years, would the spell be broken, allowing the pieces of the staff to be seen once again by human eyes; on the eve of the winter solstice when the full moon rode high in the heavens. That is if the ancient poems were true... if he could even find where the staff was hidden in this deadly place... if, if, if...

But, this was not a time for idle thinking. Morbius had sent most of his vile forces throughout the land in search of the broken pieces of the magical staff leaving Kastlerock thinly guarded. If ever Shadax's plan were to succeed, it would be this night. It was time to claim his rightful place as a king among men, or vanish anonymously into the black abyss of history.

Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.

The Launch Director has assigned a Commander to take control of several NASA Space Launches to do some necessary jobs in space. It is the commander's job to do all the pre-launch activities like fuelling the space ship and making sure all the crew are on safely and making sure all the post-launch activities are carried out like the rocket and fuel tank separation as well as the successful landing of the shuttle. The commander is also responsible for the extravehicular activities in space such as launching a satellite and building a space station.

Space Shuttle Project simulates a Space Shuttle mission from pre-launch to landing. After writing in a name, the player is presented with a mini game that requires the player to memorise numbers and a space shuttle name to get pass security. After security the space shuttle project is split into four different stages each with there own challenges as follows:

- Stage 1 - Fuel and Board Shuttle: This stage requires the commander to use the lift to turn the oxygen and hydrogen switches on and open the shuttle doors. Then the commander must move down and up the lift picking up the crew needed for the mission (increases as the levels get harder) while avoiding sliders that cross in lift's path. This task has to be done within the time limit.

- Stage 2 - Space Shuttle Launch: This stage requires the commander to control the space shuttle into orbit while disconnecting the rocket boasters (SRB) and the external tank (ET). All this is controlled by playing two mini-games that require the player to ether stop the power bar at the correct point or by moving the bottom arrow left and right to match the movements of the top arrow. A third mini-game is added later that requires the player to memorize the correct combination

- Stage 3 - Extravehicular Activities: The activities that are competed in space vary depending on the mission. Mission 1 requires the commander to release a satellite into space navigating it to avoid all the other moving satellites that are littered though space. Missions 2, 4, and 6 requires the commander to build a part of a space station by grabbing a block from the shuttle and moving it into the correct part of the space station while avoiding satellites and making sure the oxygen levels don't run out. Mission 3 requires to move and from a damaged satellite avoiding space rocks and repair it. Mission 5 is like mission 3 but to rescue a stranded Soviet cosmonaut.

- Stage 4 - Reenter Atmosphere and Land:This stage requires the commander to control the ship into reentry and land the space shuttle on a landing strip. The mini-games are the same as the space shuttle launch expect the D-pad is used for stopping the power bar.

There are 6 different missions with each mission a being more difficult than the last and only five fails aloud before the whole mission fails. Password save is available by adding the supplied password numbers and space shuttle name instead of the memorized numbers at the security check.

    <desc>Did anyone ever play the original Spelunker? That really old game where you ran around in a cave and died if you fell four feet? Or if you ran into a smallish hill? Yeah, great game. Fortunately Spelunker 2 is a little bit better. This game introduces the concept of Health. Sure, you can fall from a ways and lose health, but it isn't as ridiculous as the first game. Sure, you can still lose health if you run into a smallish mound of dirt. Well, that's still stupid, I'll have to give you that.

You can choose from three heroes in this game: the Explorer, the Priest, and the ESPer. I can't really tell the difference, but they have different items and stuff. Alls I know is, your Explorer's little knife is crap. You can stab and stab at those damned enemies and it won't help much. Like those stupid bees. DAMN THOSE BEES!

But still, yeah, the game's pretty cool, if you can stand that sort of thing. Honestly though, those bees suck. And those boar things? They also suck. And all those indestructible zombies and ghosts and such? Okay, so maybe the game isn't as great as I thought.

Translation Description:

The only reason this patch is at version 0.9 is because you can apparently continue using controller 2 somehow, but Sarysa can't figure out how. Shouldn't ruin the game for all you savestate-happy freaks out there though.

A few cosmetic changes have been made to the game here: the lifebar has been replaced by a series of hearts, Zelda-style, for instance. Your Toku meter's been changed to a Holy meter. Unimportant stuff. Why it was changed in the first place, I don't know. But it's complete, and that's what matters. I guess.

In this game, you are a spelunker who climbs deep down mountain caves in search for treasure. The levels consist of many platforms, connected to each other by a riding cart, ladders, ropes, etc. You'll have to time your jumping well, because a slight fall will lead to your death, and the abyss is near! You should jump over various obstacles, avoid ghost-like enemies, climb on ropes, and use inventory items such as bombs to create little explosions that will bring you nearer to the desired treasure.

"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world. He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.

    <desc>Yes, the bastard child of the Splatterhouse series. This is another one of those games that really doesn't take itself too seriously. Of course, that much is obvious from looking at the cute super-deformed protagonist. Even with an axe and a hockey mask, he still manages to be cute. And the whole game is just as silly. Well, not incredibly silly, but it's silly at various points. Anyway, you're a dead guy who's rescuing his girlfriend, and in doing so walks perpetually to the right, and cuts up all kinds of possessed objects and demons on the way to the pathetically easy showdown with the big pumpkin thing and the really cool ending. There's even a "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen in the credits. How damned cool is that?

Translation Description:

Everything's complete, though it doesn't look great. Stop complaining.

The archive also contains some info about Kitaro's universe. This was a collaborative attempt so the information on all the authors is in readme as well.

That localization had practically nothing left from the original protagonist, as it changed even items in the game.

So strap yourself in; no need to check your ammo. You've got more than enough; and take the challenge.

--From the NES Spy Hunter instruction manual.

Overview:

Spy Hunter is a driving simulation game that originally came out as an arcade game in the early '80s. Later it came out for the good old NES.

Directions:

Accelerate you car by pressing up on the control pad and brake by pressing down. Shoot and kill the dark blue cars by pressing B; they are your enemies. But avoid shooting any other cars. You will lose points for doing so.

Some enemy cars are bullet proof, and some can spin you right off the road so be cautious.

Obtain special weapons by entering red weapon vans. If a nearby weapon van is getting out of sight, press the start button to call it. Once you enter it, you can use your special weapon by pressing A. But be aware that you will only have a small amount. Except for missles which are used to take out helicopters, special weapons are used for enemy cars behind you.

If you get far enough, you can take your car through a boat house that will fork off from the main road. You will then become a boat, and you will have the same weapons you had before as a car. You can exit the river and become a car again in a similar way.

Controls:

Up: Accelerate
Down: Brake
A Button: Special Weapon
B Button: Gun
Start Button: Call Weapon Van
Select Button: Select between special weapons (if you have more than one)

Hints:

Instruction Booklet Hints

The following hints come out of the original instruction booklet:

1. It is inadvisable to pass enemy agents on a straight road. Try to run them off the road, or wait until there are curves.

2. Oil is one of the most effective ways of dealing with trailing enemy agent ground vehicles.

3. When coming to the forks in the road, try to lure the enemy vehicle to the opposite road you intend to take.

The rest is up to you! Good luck.

Hints:

Cool Power-Up Awards!
1. Horizon missile: This is what you start out with. It is effective but weak. 2. Bow-wow missle: The first time you power-up, your weapon will be upgraded to basically a stronger version of the Horizon Missile. 3. Adenoid missile: If you have the Bow-wow missile and power-up again, you will have this weapon at your disposal. "It is the most powerful missile available." says the instruction booklet.

    <desc>God, and people think King's Knight is bad. This is an RPG (with decent graphics, at least) that follows the life of one Tom Sawyer. Although that Becky chick is totally hot, you oughta see what the black people look like. Christ, it's no wonder this was never translated. Aside from the fact that it sucks, of course. Next time someone tells you how great Square is, you say "Tom Sawyer, now shut the fuck up." Thank you.

Translation Description:

Kikuyama's native language (I'm pretty sure, anyway) is Swedish, and it really shows in this translation. Not a whole lot has been done, just basically the prologue and some menus, along with scattered dialogue. It's odd, because I remember Toma talking a long time ago about how the text in this game was compressed.. Well anyway, don't expect too much from this. This patch used to include both the patch and the already-patched rom, but for legal reasons only the patch is in this one. Deal.

Set up R.O.B. with the colored discs included in the game and then control his movements in the game by using Professor Hector to jump onto various blocks. The blocks represent commands given to R.O.B. in sequence.

This game can be played in several different ways. In the regular game, you have to stack up the colored discs as fast as possible and in a certain pattern and sequence. In memory mode you program an entire sequence of movements to move the discs and won't know if it actually works until you RUN the program. Finally there is a 1 or 2 player bingo mode in which you align different columns and rows to BINGO and activate rob commands. An opponent will also hop around activating commands. Your goal is to have R.O.B. move as many of the colored discs without dropping them.

Running Stadium was developed and published by Bandai and was released in Japan in 1986 and in North America in 1987 under the title Stadium Events. However, shortly after release, Nintendo purchased the North American rights to the Family Fun Fitness series and decided to market the series themselves. As a result, Stadium Events was renamed and repackaged under the title World Class Track Meet, and all Family Fun Fitness mats and copies of Stadium Events were pulled from store shelves. Stadium Events has become the hardest to find licensed game available on the Nintendo Entertainment System; there exist less than 10 known complete (cartridge, manual, and box) copies of Stadium Events.

Despite the changes, the three games remain identical to one another, aside from the name change on the title screen. The game featured an Olympics-style competition, with events such as the 100m dash, 110m hurdles, long jump, and triple jump. Race opponents were named after animals, the slowest being Turtle and the fastest being Cheetah.

    <desc>
The game is set in Congo, Africa, in 1870, and its main character is a historical figure. You play as Henry M. Stanley (1841-1904), a reporter for the New York City Newspaper, who was sent by his employers to chronicle the work of the famous Africa-explorer, Dr. Livingston. Unfortunately, the Doctor left without you, hating press and everything connected to it. Recently he disappeared somewhere in the jungle of Congo, leaving only a few notes. Apparently, he was on the trail of re-discovering the legendary lost temple of the Amut people, Am-Zutuk. You decide to follow his steps, to find the lost Dr. Livingston, and maybe to learn more about the mysterious people of Amut and the temple.

The game takes you to Congo, where you can move from location to location on a "world map" with about a hundred accessible areas. You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including "native" ones such as blowpipe and spear.

In the year 2010 of Dimension Almanac, there was a mysterious planet named GORDESS which was moving in the darkness of the cosmos for the purpose of mass murder and plunder. Everyone gave up fighting against GORDESS because of its awesome power. One day a brave soldier riding a space patroller challenged GORDESS to fight. People called this space patroller "FINAL STAR", wishing to be saved. You must bring an end to the murders which have been committed for the past 2,000 years.

--From the NES Star Force instruction manual.

Overview:

Star Force is one of my favorite classic games. It's simple, yet highly addictive. Star Force starts easy enough, but as you get higher up into the levels it gets a lot harder. This game had a unique level system. The levels are based on the Greek alphabet. So, in all there are 24 levels. Well, actually, after you beat the game, there is a bonus level justly entitled infinity. This game in near impossible to beat without the save state feature, so I do not suggest trying to beat it legit. Star Force is a great game, so go give it a try.

Directions:

Fight your way through the levels and kill as many enemies as you can.

Controls:

A Button: Shoot
B Button: Shoot
Start Button: Start/Pause

Hints:

If you see blocks with ?'s on them, you can shoot them and you might find an extra man.

A strange and evil presence is lurking in space. Crushing everything in its path, destroying spaceships full of innocent people, the Starbrain is threatening the entire Galactic Empire. Starbrain, a giant computer programmed only for destruction, inhabits an enormous space station, guarded by enemy ships and robot creatures. To penetrate the station is a job for the most skillful and experienced Star Soldier - you! You'll be piloting Caesar, the fastest fighter ship in the Galactic Fleet, with an awesome arsenal of weapons at your fingertips. Only you can end the brutal Starbrain's spree of destruction, and restore peace to the galaxy!(Taken from the Star Soldier Instruction Manual)

This is just like any other space shooter out there. In order to do what the manual's story says, you have to blast the enemies flying around. Also, you'll find green squares on the enemy ship which increase your score. The "P" circles give you a power up. Collect three and you'll shoot all around you. But beware of the bosses! The mini-boss in each level is a skull like robot. It doesn't take much to defeat those, but the main boss is even harder. It is Starbrain, some piece of junk with a red "eye". If you lose, you start at some random point in the level, which I don't like at all. I like the theme of the game, but the levels look somewhat similar. I feel that you should give this game a try and have fun.

Directions:

Defeat enemy spacecraft and stop the evil Starbrain before it destroys you and your fellow crewmen.

A Button: Fire

On orders from Starfellt, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise was in the vicinity of Sigma Iotia collecting data on strange disturbances in the local gravitational and magnetic fields. The fluctuations produced a mysterious "hole" in space and, as the hole grew in size, the Enterprise was nearly drawn into its center. Miraculously, at the last moment a space distortion threw the Enterprise and her crew into the heart of uncharted space. Safe from harm for the time being, it is up to the Enterprise to return to the Iotian system and find a way to reverse this rip in space before it grows too large and the galaxy is annihilated!

--From the NES Star Trek 25th Anniversary instruction manual.

Directions:

Complete your mission by exploring the planet for your objective. You can't kill anything unless you set your phazor to full in the options menu.

Don't let anyone die! Watch how your crew moves and learn their idiocies, or you'll have Spock running into enemies all the time.

Cadets at Starfleet Academy must spend some of their classes in the starship simulator. This year is a simulation of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Substituting for Jean-Luc Picard, cadets will take the role of captain and then must access different crew members (functions of the ship) to complete a series of scripted missions.

Star Trek: The Next Generation is divided into a series of missions. Players will start on the main screen of the bridge and from there can access Navigation, Tactical, Operations, Engineering, Transporter Systems and Mission Control. Mini-games are sometimes used to complete certain ship functions (such as rerouting power to the shields).

The mystery of the cipher

Not long ago, high school student and part-time adventurer Mike Jones jour- neyed to the South Seas and single-handedly put an end to the schemes of an evil alien named Zoda. He also managed to save his uncle, the famous archae- ologist Dr. Steve Jones, and seven space children from Zoda's clutches.

Mike has now returned to his home is Seattle where Dr. Jones is attempting to decipher a strange inscription that he found on the side of the space child- ren's escape pod. The cipher was written by Hirocon, the leader of the planet Argonia. WHen Zoda's forces attacked Argonia, Hirocon sent the children away so that they could escape from the wrath of this powerful villain. If Dr. Jones can decipher the inscription, it may clue Mike in on how he can destroy the evil aliens once and for all.

Dr. Jones believes that the answer to the puzzle lies somewhere in The Oxford Wonder World, a book that he received some time ago from a very wise old man. It includes stories of cavemen, Cleopatra, Leonardo da Vinci and many other people of the past. If Dr. Jones can uncover the mystery of the inscription, he might be able to find a connection between the stories in the book and the plight of the Argonians.

Hints:

It takes Mike about half a second to turn when you push the button. It's not a huge deal, but keep that in mind when you have to make those split second turns.

This time, you get to diagonal jump and move. It may seem like a lifesaver, and I definitely appreciated it, but be wary that some jumps will be FAR harder to make now than they normally were, due to the fact you can turn in midair and land in water or somewhere you didn't want to land.

Save the weapons and special items for when you need them. You don't get an unlimited amount of them; so don't waste them on easy enemies or bosses.

Remember that Mike can only jump one space at a time, so don't make those two tile jumps, unless you have the special item that allows you to.

Hi. My name is Michael Jones, but my friends call me Mike. I'm fifteen years old and I live in Seattle Washington.

Have you heard of my Uncle Steve? Well, most people don't call him that, they call him Dr. Jones. He is a very famous archaeologist who is looking for some lost ruins in the Coral Sea. I've never actually met him, but last week I received a letter from him inviting me to stay with him at his laboratory on C-Island.

I leave tomorrow on a helicopter! I bet I won't be able to sleep at all tonight. Well, goodnight.

Today I landed on C-Island after a long helicopter ride. The people are very friendly, and they all seem to know my Uncle.

At Coralcola

I sure like this village, but I haven't been able to find my uncle anywhere and no one here seems to know where he is either.

"Hi Mike! I'm Chief Coralcola, a close friend of your uncle's.

Listen! Try not too be upset... Your uncle, Dr. Jones... has been... abducted!!

Mike, you are the best hope of rescuing Dr. Jones."

"I'm the Shaman of Coralcola, and the Chief's sister. Many wild monsters are said to be lying in wait in the dark below.

But remember! The magic of the Southern Cross is always on your side.

Look for the Southern Cross in the sky above to help you find your way.

Good luck!"

--From the NES Startropics instruction manual.

Overview:

One of Nintendo's earliest forgotten treasures, many people might have heard of StarTropics but never were able to actually play this fine game.

The graphics are very nicely done for the NES, your main character a good size to see on the screen and the enemies detailed as well. Textures are also well done when searching around islands. The sound and music are also pretty cool, some of the best that this 8-bit machine could give.

But the real joy of StarTropics lies in its gameplay. While you look around islands in a sort of early Final Fantasy style, when you come into the dungeon areas, you'll see a resemblance to The Legend of Zelda. This style works very well and it was very different than other titles at the time. The control might be a bit punishing at first, but with practice you'll be able to pull off near-perfect jumps and attacks in no time.

Easily one of the best forgotten games on the NES, StarTropics is one that you should certainly give a go. The overall presentation is amazing and the challenge factor is certainly there, making you strive to get better and better at it. I totally recommend this game to any fans of the RPG-genre!

Directions:

Unlike many adventure games on the NES, StarTropics is broken up into chapters, therefore the storyline is linear and you have that one path to follow. In total, StarTropics has a number of 8 chapters.

When you start the game, you are thrown into a town with a map setting very similar to Final Fantasy.

When in these towns, you can speak to people and gain new information. Keep in mind that the story can only progress, at times, if you speak to everybody in a certain area.

When you move to a dungeon area, the game switches mechanics and you travel in a top-down view that mirrors The Legend of Zelda. In each room, it's common to encounter different enemies. This is where you can fight them, initially with the Island Yo-Yo, the first weapon you acquire. This is unlike any yo-yo, in that it's an island treasure and can be used for stiff combat. Keep in mind that later on in the game, you are able to upgrade this weapon.

When you reach the end of a dungeon, you are met with a big boss character. Similar to many adventure games, this creature requires something of a strategy in order to fight and counteract its pattern. These are often tough to defeat, which adds to the challenge factor already set in.

From the start, like The Legend of Zelda, you are given a heart meter which counts as your life. This will be used during the dungeon segments. If you find yourself losing health, you are able to fill up your heart meter with the use of small hearts or collecting stars. The meter can also be lengthened by one with the use of Big Hearts, which are, in essence, the Heart Containers of the Zelda games. You are also given three lives from the start; if you lose them all, you have to restart from the beginning of the dungeon you're at. Also, keep in mind that you can gain extra lives with the use of "Try-Your-Luck Signs."

Aside from the Island Yo-Yo, there are other weapons that you can gain. In addition to this, you can upgrade it to the Shooting Star (6 full hearts required) and the Supernova (1/2 meter full or 11 full hearts required). If you don't meet these requirements, it'll downgrade to the next lowest weapon. 

Controls:

A Button: Talk, Look at Objects, Jump (Dungeon Mode)
B Button: Attack
Start Button: Pause Game
Select Button: Bring Up Info Screen, Change Weapon (Dungeon Mode)

Hints:

Letter Password
When StarTropics was first released, the game came with a special letter that you had to put water on in order to gain a password to continue on. Since you obviously won't be able to get the physical letter while playing this, the password you tell the robot at Level 4 is: 747.

CosmoStation Noah, located in Spiral Galaxy IX, is under siege by Molok Wardrivers. Now it's time for the pilot of the RH119 to fend off the Molok Wardrivers and save the CosmoStation.

Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade your equipment to fight off the enemy fleet. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If you do not warp to different sectors wisely, the player might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.

This is not the same game as LucasArts' version, which was released in the US. Unlike that one, which mixed sidescrolling parts with overhead pod trips, this one is more of a platformer where you control Luke Skywalker as he goes and plays parts of the movie by using your Lightsaber to mow your way through the enemies.

And the first boss? Well, it's your own pop, Darth Vader. Except he's not Vader. Which is strange because he turns into this scorpion thing when you hit him once. And when you beat the first stage, you get on the Millenium Falcon to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi.

So wow, you get your first Lightsaber before meeting old Ben!

The game is pretty good, with its graphics suffering because of the huge detail that the characters are supposed to have... whereas that simply cannot be recreated on an NES. That doesn't mean it's not fun. Just get used to the fact that Luke dies with a single hit, that there are no continues, and that the control's a little shoddy, and you'll be fine.

Translation Description:

The game is a 2D sidescrolling action game and several other missions, such as flying your X-Wing out in space, shooting at Tie Fighters, and the last mission, flying your X-Wing to take out the Death Star. I estimate that you'll get about 45 minutes of enjoyment out of this game, should you play all the way to the end and beat the game. Probably, the most difficult area to pass in the game would be the first visit to the Death Star.

I'm almost certain that everything has been translated in this game. Honookatana translated the scripts, so thanks to him.

Version 1.10 has been released. A few emulation incompatibilities have been solved. Also, the force menu has been redone to use one tile per letter instead of squishy fonts. Also, the dialog has been adjusted a bit to have more of a Star Wars feel to it. A big thanks to Cahos Rahne Veloza in testing and making suggestions to improve the patch, along with discovering the old patch did not work right with Nestopia 1.37.

Based on the movie, so the storyline is basically the same. You play as Luke Skywalker, and using your blaster, lightsaber and force power skills, you must journey through Hoth, Echo Base, Dagobah, Bespin and Cloud City. Enemies such as Darth Vader and Boba Fett will appear along the way, while R2, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear to give you tips on enemy weakness. Also keep and eye out for things you won't see in the movie, such as trying to beat Slave 1 (Boba Fett's ship) and fighting Cloud Cars.

EPISODE IV A NEW HOPE

It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy.

--From the NES Star Wars instruction manual.

Overview:

This game, although not an award winning piece, is worth playing. The graphics, although not the best, are a good size and look smooth. The sounds and music score are pretty good, though. The game-play varies from platform to first person pilot. You'll probably have to practice to get the feel of these. The storyline is kinda silly because they strayed from the movie that it's supposed to be based on. You have to rescue people like Obi Wan, R2, and 3PO from different systems. You do blow up the Death Star at the end though. This game is a lot of fun for anybody who likes Star Wars or video games that involve differetn types of gameplay.

Directions:

For the most part, the game is a typical side-scrolling platformer with two difficulty settings-the Novice Mission and the Pro Mission. Luke uses the lightsaber as his primary attack and can also use the Force to execute special maneuvers like floating, speeding and stopping time, among others. Energy to activate Force powers can be obtained through diamonds collected after killing an enemy. When the characters are rescued, they will help Luke by providing hints and other actions that are important to progress through the game.

Between planets, the Millennium Falcon is forced to fight a wave of TIE Fighters that prevent it's entrance to the next planet. The game switches to a first-person shooter perspective.

The final level involves using the X-Wing against the Death Star. While the film's climactic sequence occurred inside a long trench, the game's version can be roughly described as a vertically-scrolling overhead maze-like stage, complete with dead ends and intersections. At the end, there is the reactor's duct where the proton torpedoes will be shot automatically to destroy the station. If the player fails to get to the end within a limited amount of time, the Death Star will destroy Yavin IV and the game will be over.

The game is particularly difficult, as the player only has three lives and two continues (activated with enough diamonds), and Luke dies upon touching an enemy. The Millennium Falcon can sustain only one hit before being destroyed, which could be prevented using one of three deflector shield bursts.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Fire, use weapon, accelerate Landspeeder
Start Button: Pause game
Select Button: Open select screen

Hints:

Come In Blasting!
Always fire first and ask questions later. If you shoot ahead of you, chances are you will kill enemies before they appear. You have unlimited ammo and you can't hurt your allies, so blast away!

The Stealth Advanced Tactical Fighter, America's most closely guarded military secret, is in your hands. You're at the controls, flying top-priority combat missions against enemy forces around the world.

Luckily, you're prepared for the worst. Your aircraft has all the right stuff -- maneuverability, speed, weapons capability, and deception. Once you get the bogeys in your sights, you can pulverize them with missles or cannon fire, then move in on your next target. When the bad guys lock on to your craft, you just kick into "stealth mode" and drive their radar systems crazy.

Each time you complete a mission, you move on to another theatre of war. Your opponents get meaner and tougher -- but so do you, and soon they won't stand any chance at all.

    <desc>This is one of those games that really could have benefitted from an instruction manual. People say that this is a Phantasy Star clone, but I wouldn't know, since I've never played them. Yeah yeah, I know, PS rules, shut up. I assume the game is in the future, and it starts out with you crash landing (maybe?) on a planet from which you got a distress signal. It's all very confusing, since you have no clue what anyone's talking about. The items and weapons are equally confusing. The menus are awkward, the status screens are incomprehensible, and the battles are pretty fun, but very sloooow. However, despite everything, it manages to go beyond it all and end up being a pretty fun game. Since you don't know what's going on, it IS quite frustrating. I admit I didn't give it much of a chance, since I can't handle much frustration at six in the morning.

Translation Description:

necrosaro just came out of the blue one day with this completely translated game. He'll admit not even he, nor anyone he knows, can beat the game, but everything should be translated anyways.

Save Professor Cinnamon! When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two Twinbee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy!

In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

    <desc>Storehouse No.18 is a Russian Sokoban clone that has many storehouses to play and even an editor to design your own storehouses. Despite the bland looking graphics, a lot of fun can be had from this game.

This game's original GoodNES name is Warehouse No.18, renamed according to the translation. Warehouse and storehouse in Russian being nearly the same, storehouse being more accurate from what I was told by blackhole89 who is from Russia.

All text has been translated in the game, as far as I can tell. Several assembly hacks have been made, most notably in my opinion is the removal of the hack protection scheme that caused the game to hang in reset if you changed a single byte. Most areas that I tried changing before removing the hack protection scheme always seemed to hang the game in reset.

Also the grey screen at the beginning of the game has been limited to a single frame in order to be less noticeable. Many of the windows have been resized, text has been repositioned by assembly hacking. The ROM has also been expanded to 32K PRG. Normally, ROM expansion for mapper 0 16K games to 32K is easy as cake, not so with this game. The text pointers are assembly hard-coded, so that required some basic assembly hacking.

NOTE: In worlds 3-1 and 6-2, you're going to have to find the vine to find the flagpole, but in 3-1, it's not so hard. In world 6-2 though, it's in the last block that's above the tenth pipe in the level.

    <desc>Yep, it's a badass Technos basketball game. Being technos, it should be a given that the game concentrates more on beating the snot out of your opponents than actually playing basketball. Also being a Technos game, it should be a given that it's quite fun. Anyway, the "courts" (and I do use the term loosely) are riddled with obstacles, weapons and multi-level baskets, and are in such locales as Navy Ship Yards, downtown San Francisco, and many other zany places like that. You know, normal, Technos-style fun-fun ^_^

Translation Description:

Ipkiss finished the game, but the disk the patch was on got corrupted. Ha! So this is a three-month old patch that isn't quite done, but it's good enough, so quit your bitching.

Ken grew up in a world of violence. He mastered the martial arts at a very early age and went on a global tour to challenge the greatest Street Fighters of the world. He was victorious. Upon returning to his home country he enroll- ed at Bargham University and began his life study in the field of Cybotics. While at Bargham, he was befriended by a gifted classmate named Troy. After many years, they perfected a revolutionary discovery they named Cyboplasm.

This substance, when properly administered, could make a man several times stronger than normal. This came at a good time, for mankind had just perfected travel to the "frontier" of other worlds. Ken had no interest in traveling to the new frontier, but he was glad their invention could be helpful.

One day he came to their lab and found it nearly destroyed. His partner Troy was killed, and their formula was stolen. The killer escaped to the new worlds. Ken knew he must avenge his fallen friend. He now has a very keen interest in the frontier...

"Strider" is the strongest secret maneuvers group in the world. It specializes in smuggling, kidnapping, demolitions, disruption, etc. One strider of C- grade is equivalent to one well-trained team of special corps.

Hiryu was the youngest strider of Super-A grade. After eliminating the sister of a mad A-grade Strider, he decided to retire and was spending his life peacefully in Mongolia.

One day the Vice-Driector of Strider, Matic, showed up. Apparently, Hiryu's friend Kain had been caught by the enemy. Matic ordered Hiryu to destroy his friend Kain and threatened to start slaughtering Mongolians if Hiryu refused.

Hiryu had no choice but to return. fter rescuing Kain, he discovered the fearful plan conceived by the Striders and an organization called "Enterprise" an evil project called "ZAIN"

Hiryu decided to destroy the ZAIN mind-control weapon along with Enterprise and the Striders. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.

--From the NES Strider instruction manual.

Overview:

Gamers familiar with the arcade hit by the same name might be wondering what this game has to do with that one. Is this a sequel? An alternate reality? Or just another totally different game that happens to have the same name and a few other things in common? Well, the answer is that Strider Hiryu was originally a character in an obscure Japanese comic book, and this game is based on his story-line from the comic, while the arcade version, which was later ported to Sega Genesis, features a very different plot about Communist dictators and alien invasion.

If you let the main screen go away you're shown 3 characters (Sheena, Kain, and Strider Hiryu) after the definitions of striders. It then shows the main base and has very impressive 8-bit music, possibly the best I ever heard in an 8-bit game. Once you start the game you're automatically thrown into a compelling, but very confusing storyline. The game is set up very nicely, especially for the day and age of the system and game. It is very unique on what your destination is and how power ups are found. All the little clues kept me wanting to find more and more, all the while I was advancing through the levels without taking notice and learning more about what was going on. (I'm sorry I don't want to spoil it) I may have understood the game a bit more if I hadn't played strider on GEN as a kid. The game play is fairly simple, don't let your health deplete to 0, kill everything you see, and collect everything you're given! The wide range of people you meet and places you go also added interest to the game. This is definitely one solid NES game that I suggest to all if you like Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi!

9.5 out of 10!

Directions:

Start out on an available level of your choice, eliminating enemies one by one, sometimes giving you health to help you throughout the level. Some levels have many different path choices to take, some smart and some you may want to think twice about. Almost each level has some sort of power up or hidden item for you. For extra help on finding these items you can acquire data disks and analyze them at the base. A message on the floppy will tell you places to look or certain missions to accomplish. Raise your level and power up to make it through the 13 levels of the game!

    <desc>Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation.

The back-story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the countryside. Of course, what kind of game would it be if there weren't fearless heroes to step in and fix things? That's where the four Dice Heroes step in. The four Dice Heroes will, of course, be under your control.

The four Dice Heroes are your basic stock-issue fantasy characters. There's the fighter, he's got a moderately high amount of strength, and a decent balance of everything. There's the dwarf, who's got plenty of strength and endurance, but he's dumb as a brick. There's the elf, who's really good at magic but has no HP and very little strength. Then there's the half-elf, who's fair and balanced. You must pick one of these characters before each level, and you're stuck with them until you finish.

Now, all of this may sound cliche, and you'd be correct. But all the cliches in the story are offset but the offbeat game play. Each area is made up of a path that is predetermined for the most part. Every time you move, you roll a die and move that many spaces. Some squares trigger events, which range from encounters with townsfolk, to warp tiles, to healing spring, and more. Some squares have multiple exits, and the one you end up using depends on which character you are, or how you answer a certain question. Any square without an event leads to a battle.

Battle is a bit different compared to most NES role-playing games. You face monsters one-on-one, and each side rolls a die. The side that rolls the higher number gets a number of attack equal to the difference between the die rolls. So if you roll a four and the monster rolls a two, you get two attacks. The loser gets to sit there and take it. In the even of the tie, you keep the tying roll and roll again. The winner of that roll gets to attack, and the defender loses their defenses. Using magic operates on the same principal.

Basically, each level continues like this until you either die, or you reach the cave where the boss resides. Then you can go back to the castle, buy some gear, and get your next assignment, until you finish the game.

If you're looking for an NES role-playing game that's a welcome departure from Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy clones, this game is right up your alley.

Translation Description:

There was a complete translation of this game made years earlier (done by, I think, RPG Castle), but the dialogue was completely made up, so it doesn't really count as a translation.

So AlanMidas stepped in and did an actual translation. The game is completely in English and playable, but there are some bugs. Sometimes, the text in the status screen is gibberish (though the stats themselves are fine), and there's the occasional typo. But if you can deal with that, (I've made it to the end, myself), then feel free to check it out.

    <desc>Sumo wrestling! Everybody loves it. This game (the video game, at least) involves you mashing buttons in an attempt to throw the other guy out of the ring. What do the buttons do? I do not know. Play the game anyway.

Translation Description:

This is one of those gaijin-hating games, where all of the text is displayed vertically. And, most of it's kanji, which Toma didn't translate. So the smallish percentage of stuff that IS done is kinda hard to read, cause you have to tilt your head to one side and stuff. Anyway, all the hiragana is translated, all the kanji is not.

Hop on your skateboard and get to church! Piece of cake, you say? Boy, are you in for a surprise. Not everyone wants you to go to church, and they're going to do whatever they can to stop you. So get ready for the ride of your life, and don't let go of your trusty Bible. It will keep you on the right path. If that doesn't wear you out, try your hand at Fish Fall, the fast moving flying fish game that will test your coordination while teaching you Bible verses to help you become fishers of men. Or, if you're in need of a little musical enjoyment, try singing lead vocals to "Ride of Life", the hot new song from Dove Award winning group of the year, 4HIM. Whatever your mood, Sunday Funday will keep you on your toes!

This is a top-view racing game, stylistically influenced by Super Sprint, from the company who later produced the Lotus series of games.

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game

You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman  get the right combination and the price will drop.

Hints:

An unusual easter egg was featured in the game, whereby typing in a certain swear word in the name screen will reset the game.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>An extensive graphics and text hack of Castlevania 2, with a couple surprises as well. Here's a complete list of all the changes, straight from the readme:

CHARACTERS AND ENEMIES:

 -  Completely new look for Simon. I gave him clothes that look like the guy in "Super Castlevania IV." He also has a bandana and long hair that even flips up in the back on his whip follow-through.
 -  Mario, Luigi, and Toad from "Super Mario Bros. 2? show up!
 -  Samus from "Metroid" shows up in the church to give Simon energy.
 -  Kirby also makes a guest appearance.
 -  Alex and Ryan from "River City Ransom" show up to sell Simon weapons and items.
 -  Kid Icarus shows up in the basement of the third town.
 -  Link shows up in the cemeteries.
 -  A Fighter from Final Fantasy replaces the ferry man.
 -  Many new enemies. These include: from.. SMB2: Birdo, Shyguy, and the Key Guardian. Kid Icarus: Egg Plant Wizard. Metroid: Ridley and the Metroids. Zelda II: the Iron Knights, Goblins, spiders, and bats. Mega Man II: Dr. Wily and the tall square dude with eyes. SMB3: Larry Koopa, Chain Chomp, and a Boomerang Bro. SMB1: Koopa Troopa (turtle)
 -  Sonic the Hedgehog makes a "guest" appearance in the Mansions.

GRAPHIC EDITS:

 -  The small hearts you collect from enemies are now rubies from Zelda and the larger hearts are the bags from Zelda 2.
 -  Those boring blocks that you walk on are changed to rocks, blocks, tiles, etc. from games like SMB3, Blaster Master, SMB2, Zelda 2, etc. You are also now able to tell the difference between regular blocks and those that you can break with the holy water.
 -  White Crystal changed to Brass Knuckles from RCR.
 -  Mario gives you a Mushroom instead of a Blue Crystal,and a Vegetable from SMB2 instead of a Red Crystal.
 -  Knives changed to look like Link's sword in Zelda 2.
 -  Dracula's heart is replaced with his rotten, blood drenched tooth.
 -  The laurels that make you invincible are replaced with stars from any of the Super Mario Bros. games.
 -  The Konami emblem on the title screen is replaced with the "Super Castlevania II" emblem.
 -  All letters have a shadowed look to them.
 -  The rib also has a new look on the action screen.
 -  The windows in the towns look cooler.
 -  There are now steps up to the doors in the towns.
 -  The cross above the church is changed to an Energy Tank from Metroid.
 -  Colors fixed for Nesticle v.0.43

TEXT EDITS:

 -  All three endings are changed!
 -  Fixed the garble on the start screen and code screen and made the code screen usable!
 -  All text east of the first town is changed as well as the first western town. (humorous things like silly one-liners and deep thoughts)
 -  The main screen has a new look including a version counter.
 -  The story is completely different.
 -  After you hit "start," it says "START NOW" instead of "GAME START" and "USE CODE" instead of "PASSWORD." I have also given credit to Konami and myself while keeping with the movie theme that occurs in the first three Nintendo Castlevania games in the opening screens.
 -  When you start a new game it says "GET READY" instead of "GAME START" and "LIVES" instead of "PLAYER."
 -  New text for starting night and day sequences.
 -  Other little things like "LTHR W." instead of "L. WHIP" and such.

    <desc>One of the best pirate companies, proud enough of its games to place its name on them, was Hi-Game. The company brought to the Famicom a few games that were never made for the Famicom. By porting the games from other systems, Hi-Game gave Famicom gamers something new to play all the way up to 1999, even though the last licensed Famicom game was released in 1994. This is true of Super Donkey Kong 2, also called Donkey Kong Country.

Most Hong Kong originals and ports are poor in quality, with ridged controls that make the game difficult to play. Hi-Game, however, was successful in recreating this Donkey Kong game for the Famicom. You avoid and kill enemies, gather bananas and letters, and monkey your way to the end of each level.

Your shuttle commander's log.

Spacedate: August 15, 2005.

I had just started my repair work on the Allied Space Agency spy satellite, when I was caught in a dimensional rip in space. All outside contact has been severed. Without spacesuits or weapons my only hope is to use my jet-powered robo-repair glove to try to find a way out of this drifting maze in space.

Spacedate: August 16, 2005.

I can't help but wonder whether this maze is a freak of nature or created by some alien race to test my intelligence. I have tried to break out, but nothing seems to work. The robo-glove is useless against the walls of force around me. There must be a way out.

Spacedate: August 17, 2005.

Balls of energy seem to form out of thin air and float around this insidious space trap. I tried to hold one of these balls, but couldn't hold it for long. However, I have learned to hit these floating balls to break holes in the force field surrounding. I am now moving onto the next level. Who knows what new challenge will be waiting for me?

Spacedate: August 18, 2005.

There are things alive in here, strange things I've never seen before! They're trying to destroy me. So far my only defense seems to be hitting them with energy balls. My glove charges are getting low. I don't know whether I'm going to make it. This may be my last entry.

    <desc>
In the summer of 1990, the biggest Jeopardy tournament is happening. And you're in it! You have to go through 3 grueling games of asking questions and using your mental power to defeat your opponents. But there's more than enough obstacles in your way. Categories with topics you know everything about, categories you don't know anything about. And that daily double that strikes at times you don't expect it. Can you win those 3 fate deciding games to win the Super Jeopardy tournament?

When I got an old NES back in 2003, this game was the first one I got. It's a classic in the Jeopardy games. Because this Jeopardy game would be first with "digitalized speech". The graphics were great, the questions good for ages 10 and up, and what knocked my breath out most was the facial expressions. Characters made faces when they got a wrong question, and clapped when they got one right. It's an amazing, but even a little bit creepy, Jeopardy game.

Directions:

The game is very simple to play. First you must choose what round you want to play. If you're new, you have to go into a quarter final game. Once you've chosen the quarter final game, you choose the amount of humans playing (the computers will even it out to make 4 contestants) and then, you get to pick your name. Unfortunately, you can only have 5 letter names or less. So shortening your name down or picking a cool word works too. Then, you get to pick your avatar. Once that is done, the jeopardy begins.

Controls:

A Button: Selects things, buzzes in, picks letters
B Button: Selects things, buzzes in, picks letters
Start Button: Brings you to game selection screen
Select Button: Nothing

Hints:

Final Jeopardy strategy
Not much I can say, except, be strategic on Final Jeopardy and Daily Doubles. For example, say you are in Final Jeopardy. You own 7000 points, while your closest opponent has 3000 points. Do the math. He or she will always double their points in Final Jeopardy. So if they get the correct response, you should at least wager 999 points. Because if you lose, you'll still have one point over your opponent. So, always do the math in Final Jeopardy. It will save your life, and you'll win more games that way.

    <desc>Mario decided it was time for a vacation, so he went to the Tofu Kingdom for some rest and relaxation. One of the sites he was going to visit first was a famous play where the most beautiful Geisha in all the land performs. When Mario buys his ticket he notices a big ball of light coming from the sky and crashes right into the hall where he was going to watch the play. When Mario arrives at the hall he sees people running out in a panic and some people already dead in a massacre. When Bowser sees that Mario is at the Tofu Kingdom he takes the famous Geisha along with her three uncles, and flies away into the sky. One of her other uncles was lying on the floor and tells Mario that Bowser has gone into the Exile Valley, he also warns Mario that people who went there has never returned. So before he dies, he gives Mario a map where the Valley is located. So now Mario is in a new land, with a new quest, while he's on vacation?

Super Loco Spoof! is a Smb1 hack that was being made while I was working on my other hacks in progress. You'll notice that there's a couple of changes in this hack, like the ability to shoot while being small. Hard players will get their fix since the levels are challenging. So if you have what it takes, help Mario save the Geisha.

In this Jump'n Run, you take on the role of the Man of Steel and must free Metropolis from criminals in several missions.

You start the game as Clark Kent, but as long as you have enough energy, you can change into Superman. Apart from jumping and punching, Superman can also use different super powers such as Heat Vision, X-Ray Vision (makes certain enemies visible), two kinds of Super Breaths (one that freezes certain enemies) and Super Flight which takes him to different locations.

    <desc>Super Mario Bash includes all new levels (all 8 worlds) and new graphics. I find most Mario hacks to be too hard (by making them super-hard they get away with only changing world 1?), and not actually fun, like it's supposed to be. So my levels are more like what you'd find in a real Mario game.

BTW, I borrowed some graphics from the Japanese Mario 2, but I think there's a little bit from other hacks as well. It's been 5+ years since I made it so I can't remember for sure, nevertheless find and contact the original authors to ask for permission. Hope it's not a problem.

    <desc>Super Mario Bros 3 - 2nd Run is the latest of my "Level only" hacks. Building on what I have learned from my previous hack, SMB3-2R is in many ways even better then my first attempt. The same commitment has gone into this hack to make it a great game to play. I have invested even more time into this hack then my previous one, and it shows -- at least this is what many people who have tried it have told me. Give this a try, I don't believe you will be disappointed.

There's also a HTM file with this patch that talks about this hack from the original authors.

So here's the final version of Super Mario Bros. Challenge, a tribute if you will, to The Challenge Games Community. Enjoy the hack everyone. :D

    <desc>Super Mario Bros. DX is a complete graphics upgrade for Super Mario Bros., based partly on Super Mario Bros. 3 including a combination of directly-imported, modified, and entirely new graphics. Special attention has been paid to color. This hack may be combined with separate level hacks, or (if credited) used as a springboard for your own hacks.

    <desc>Hello there! You're probably here because you're looking for a fun hack of Super Mario Bros, right? If so, Super Mario Bros HF could be just for you. Perhaps the main focus of SMBHF is the difficulty. Most hacks that redo levels (at least the ones that I've tried) make the game nearly impossible! I've had quite a few games where I couldn't get past the first few levels without savestates. In my opinion, games like these are just not fun. How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump? I don't think you can.

That is why SMBHF's levels are about as difficult as the original game's. You will NOT find ultra-hard levels in SMBHF; if you can beat Super Mario Bros, you can beat SMBHF. These levels were created for the gamer's enjoyment, not for the gamer's frustration. Each level (1-1 through 8-4) has been changed. Some have been changed moreso than others, but each has been significantly altered.

The lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing. Some major graphic changes include: New floor tile, New underwater tile, New "?" blocks, New brick graphics (Borrowed from SMB2J), and others. There are also some minor graphic changes that you may notice throughout the game. (And yes, those lines on Mario's face are longer sideburns.)

If you expect SMBHF to be terribly difficult, you will probably be dissapointed. If you are here to play an enjoyable remake of the original, you should enjoy this game. Thanks for giving SMBHF a try, and I'm sure you will enjoy it! ^_^

    <desc>This is a hack of the original SMB2 game with new levels. The idea behind this hack is that it's the same SMB2 game we all love, but with entirely new levels. Game difficulty is easy to moderate but rises from moderate to nightmare for worlds 6 and 7. Ain't that nice?

The Mushroom Kingdom has been a peaceful place thanks to the brave deeds of Mario and Luigi. The Mushroom Kingdom forms an entrance to the Mushroom World where all is not well. Bowser has sent his 7 children to make mischief as they please in the normally peaceful Mushroom World. They stile the royal magic wands from each country in the Mushroom World and used them to turn their kings into animals. Mario and Luigi must recover the royal magic wands from Bowser's 7 kids and return the kings to their true forms. "Goodbye and good luck!," said the Princess and Toad as Mario and Luigi set off on their journey deep into the Mushroom World.

"We took 7 wands from the 7 kings. Each of us has one. Our father has instructed us to protect the wands."

--From the NES Super Mario Bros. 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

It wasn't long ago when Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Toadstool had set off on their exciting adventure to rescue the Subcon World. The characters have now arrived back at the Mushroom Kingdom, and it seems that everything is remaining peaceful...until one fateful day...

Bowser invades again! But this time it's not the Mushroom Kingdom he's after. It's the Mushroom WORLD he wants! And this time he's brought his 7 Kids (known as the Koopalings) to help him control the world! Bowser and his 7 children, Iggy, Lemmy, Wendy, Morton, Roy, Larry and Ludwig Von invade the 8 kingdoms in the Mushroom World and steal each kingdom's magic wand from its holder, that kingdom's king. The Koopalings turn the kings into animals using the wands, and havoc is eventually wreaked again among the Mushroom World. But all hope is not lost...

Enter Mario and Luigi, who bear no grudge against Bowser and his children. The two brothers are now setting off to get the wands back, and kick Bowser and the Koopalings out of the Mushroom World for good! So, it's up to you to control Mario and Luigi, and help them venture through 8 worlds and restore peace to the Mushroom World.

Mario and Luigi now walk out of the gates of the Mushroom Kingdom, into the wide, open world. "Goodbye!" Princess Toadstool and Toad shout as they wave to the brothers, who are now ready for their biggest adventure yet!

Super Mario Bros. 3 was a monumental game for Nintendo. They decided to go back to the roots. In other words, they made it a lot more like Super Mario Bros. 1. An upgrade to the graphics and the addition of the ability to fly made for a great game. Super Mario Bros. 3 was the first Super Mario game to feature the overland map where you can sort of choose your own path. This game also debuted the ability to fight your opponent for the next turn. When your opponent is walking by your square, you can push your button and pull them into a Mario Bros. style battle for the next turn. You can also steal his cards in this mode. Super Mario Bros. 3 is a very fun and popular game, we have had to go out and buy more copies of this game several times. Enjoy!

Directions:

Lead Mario through the Mushroom Kingdom, restoring kings along the way to save the Princess. Classic Mario action with new powerups. Mushroom still makes to become Super Mario, but after becoming Super Mario you can become many other forms. If you grab a flower you become Fire Mario(Shoot fireballs with B), with a Leaf you become Racoon Mario. Rare suits (Tanooki, Hammer Bros., and Frog) do not require you to be any Mario form. Tanooki Mario can turn into a statue by pressing down and B, Hammer Mario can throw Hammers with B and if ducking is immune to fireball attacks, and Frog Mario helps a lot in the water, but will only slow you down on land. Star Mario is invincible.

Racoon Mario and Tanooki Mario are the only Mario transformations that can fly. To fly, hold down the B button and run across a flat surface until your P meter charges up. Jump and tap A to fly now. After a few seconds, you will lose your flight. You can now slowly lower yourself by tapping A.

Enemies with shells(not including Spikeys) can be used. Just jump on them once to put them inside their shell. Then hold B and walk into them. Release B to let them go.

Unlike Super Mario Bros. 1(And JPN 2) Mario will go back to Super Mario if he's hit when he is in any other form besides Super and Regular. A welcome change! 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Run/Grab
Start Button: Pause
Select Button: Select between 1 and 2 players

Hints:

Play in Background
To play in the Background, hold down when you are on a white 'block' (Next to the first koopa troopa in level 1). You will go into the background. In level 3 you can use this technique to get a warp whistle.

White Airships
White Airships are full of coins, and are tricky to get. They only appear on Odd Levels (1-3-5 etc...). You need to complete the level with a factor of 11 coins. Also, your score must match your coins 'tens' place. So if you have 77 coins, and end with a score of 345,074, the white Air Ship should appear.

White Mushroom Houses
To get the Secret Toad Houses, you must collect a certain amount of coins in certain levels. There is one in each world except for 8
World 1 - Level 4 (44 coins)
World 2 - Level 2 (30 coins)
World 3 - Level 8 (42? coins)
World 4 - Level 2 (22 coins)
World 5 - Level 5 (28 coins)
World 6 - Level 7 (78 coins)
World 7 - Level 2 (42 coins)

Super Mario Bros. Battle!
To play a variation of the original Mario Bros. game, you have to be in a 2 player game. Go to the second player's spot(It should be a small circle with an L or an M) and press A.

One evening, Mario had a strange dream. He dreamt of a long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never seen before spreading out as far as his eyes could see. When he strained his ears to listen, he heard a faint voice saying "Welcome to 'Subcon', the land of dreams. We have been cursed by Wart and we are completely under his evil spell. We have been awaiting your arrival. Please defeat Wart and return Subcon to its natural state. The curse Wart has put on you in the real world will not have any effect upon you here. Remember, Wart hates vegetables. Please help us!" At the same time this was heard, a bolt of lightning flashed before Mario's eyes. Stunned, Mario lost his footing and tumbled upside down. He awoke with a start to find himself sitting up in his bed. To clear his head, Mario talked to Luigi, Toad and the Princess about the strange dream he had. They decide to go to a nearby mountain for a picnic.

After arriving at the picnic area and looking at the scenery, they see a small cave nearby. When they enter this cave, to their great surprise, there's a stairway leading up, up and up. It is exactly like the one Mario saw in his dream. They all walk together up thew stairs and at the top, find a door just like the one in Mario's dream. When Mario and his friends, in fear, open the door, to their surprise, the world that Mario saw in his dream spreads out before them!

--From the NES Super Mario Bros. 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Mario Bros. 2 was a pretty fun game. It boasted a good many changes from the original. For instance, in this one you can choose to play as Mario, Luigi, Princess, or Toad. Another big difference was the ability to gain more than just two hit points. In this game you could get up to four. Personally, I didn't like Super Mario Bros. 2 as much as the original, but I think it still did pretty well. I'm glad they went back to something more like the original for Super Mario Bros. 3. If you like Mario games, be sure to try Super Mario Bros. 2.

Directions:

Pick up vegetables to hurl at enemies. The POW blocks destroy every enemy on screen! While exploring and hurling vegetables, you'll probably come across Magic Potions. By dropping it, you'll activate a door. Go inside to appear in a darker, reversed world of the world you're in now! You might also find a Mushroom to enhance your energy bar by 1, depending on where you place the potion. Be careful, though, it only works until you beat the level! You'll come across a boss or Birdo at the end of each level, so be ready!

Controls:
A Button: Jump
B Button: Pick up or drop an enemy/item/vegetable, dig sand, stop Bonus Round slots
Start Button: Select character, pause/unpause
Select Button: No use

Hints:

Characters
When choosing which character you want to use, remember that Mario is the all around guy, Luigi is known for his jumping ability, Princess can float, and Toad can pull things out of the ground the fastest.

One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopaa tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horse-hair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.

The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of the great Koopa turtle king.

Mario, the hero of this story (maybe) hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.

You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!

--From the NES Super Mario Bros. instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Mario Bros. was one of the great classics, and everyone has played it, but we will give you a little insight on the game. Based on the arcade game Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. became one of the most popular games ever. It had decent graphics and was fairly easy to play. You play either Mario Or Luigi, two plumbers that are trying to save the Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom from the dreaded King Koopa. Super Mario Bros. was the start of a great series that has continued to this day.

Directions:

Run, jump, and collect items, but most importantly keep moving. Collect Mushrooms to get bigger and flowers to spit fire. Collect coins to get extra lives.

Nine worlds, containing three levels each, stand between you and your goal. Find secret areas that might let you skip certain levels and save the princess. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Run, shoot fireballs
Start Button: Pause the game/Start the game
Select Button: Select 1 player, 2 player(or Duck Hunt if playing SMB/DH)

Hints:

Continue
If you die and lose all your lives, just hold A+B and press start at the start screen to start at the first level of the world you were in.

Extra Points
When finishing a stage you have to jump onto a flagpole as high as you can. To get the highest score possible, be sure to land on the pole as high as possible and try to land on the pole when the clock's last digit is a multiple of three. If you do this, fireworks will go off that give you extra points.

    <desc>This is a hack found on a Japanese site which does a pretty good job of hiding the fact it's a regular Mario Game. It changes the music, graphics, and level structure to be a bit unlike your normal Mario game. While it is relatively short, it is pretty fun while it lasts.

    <desc>Super Mario World is probably the most sought after and hardest to find of any Famicom pirate. There are allegedly two version of it. The first is a single game cartridge, like this one, where the game starts on the first world. The second version, found on multi-carts, starts with a level select option. Some say it's only this second version that is complete, containing all the levels.

This version of Super Mario World starts you out with 15 lives, and for a Hong Kong original, is incredible. It's probably the most fun you'll have with any pirate because it's both challenging and free of many of the glitches you see in other originals and hacks. That doesn't mean it doesn't have glitches, of course, but they're minimal.

Don't expect for this to be the SNES version of Super Mario World! Many collectors make the mistake of expecting too much from this port, because when it gets right down to it, it's nothing like the original. But it's challenging, and even though you start with 15 lives, you'll soon find those dwindled down to only a few.

Expect to pay about $60 for this. You're lucky to find it at all, much less for a reasonable price. If you can find one for less than $60, consider yourself lucky.

Pitfall Harry is back, ready to embark on the most dangerous, most impossible mission he has dared to attempt so far. All alone, with only a gun and his wits for protection, he must recover the priceless Raj diamond from a vast subterranean dwelling high in the Andes Mountains. And to complicate matters, he must also rescue his beloved niece Rhonda and feline friend Quickclaw the Lion, both trapped in the dark, damp depths below.

This is no weekend caving adventure. With no map to guide him, Harry must find his own way through the cave's endless passages-over 270 screens-infested with poisonous frogs, bats, snakes, scorpions, tarantulas, cavemen, lava pits, deadly condors, falling rocks, and other evil creatures and hazards.

Care to join Harry in his quest? He could certainly use some assistance.

--From the NES Super Pitfall instruction manual.

Overview:

Pitfall Harry's back, in a new form and a more exciting adventure! Harry has his new gun, but that probably won't get him far without his courage. He must get the Raj Diamond from the Andes Mountains, and he must rescue his niece, Rhonda, and his pet Quickclaw The Lion! There are many different monsters, so watch yourself, and good luck! 

Directions:

Do you remember those old Pitfall games for the Atari? You do?! Good! Because this plays like it, except you have one advantage: the gun, which can kill baddies! But if you touch a baddie, you lose a life, so don't underestimate this game.

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Fire gun

Hints:

Continue Game
Press Select, A, A, A, Select (on title screen).

Super Sprint started as an arcade game in 1986. Its popularity inspired game makers to port it to several other systems, NES included. It is a lot of fun to play. It's highly addictive, and frustrating at the same time.

The graphics look pretty good, but they aren't as good as the arcade. The arcade had better looking textures and shading. The sounds are pretty enjoyable. There is only music for the title screen, and the in between screens, not during the race. All you hear during the race is the hum of the engines and little sound effects when items are attained, or you crash.

The gameplay was excellent, with a nice amount of variation on seven different tracks. The ability to tune up your car was also a nice touch.

Directions:

Choose one or two players. In one player mode, it's you against the other three computer players. In two player mode, as long as you or your friend finishes first, you will advance to the next race. Player one will control the yellow car, and player two will control the blue car.

In this game second place is the first loser, it's game over if you place anything but first. If you crash your car, it will explode and another will appear, the only penalty is being left behind by the other racers.  

Randomly on the track, there will be bonus points, wrenches, oil spills, puddles, and a tornado. In the later levels you will also see cones, and bars that raise up and down for you to crash into. Wrenches can be collected to upgrade your car. If you have two wrenches at the end of a race, you will be taken to the upgrade screen. From here you can spend your wrenches on a higher top speed, more acceleration, more traction, or an increase in score. Each stat will max out at level six, then you can only spend your wrenches on a higher top score.

Oil spills will make your car spin out of control for a short period, as will the tornado. Puddles will just slow you down for a second, as will cones. Once you've hit a cone it will disappear, but the puddles will be there for the duration of the race. There are also a few tracks with shortcuts you can take that the computer cars won't. This is a never ending point battle; once you complete the seventh track, it starts over with a few tricks thrown in to up the difficulty. There was a secret track at stage 85 in the arcade version, but I'm not sure if it was added into this NES port. 

Controls:

A Button: Gas
B Button: Brake
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select

Hints:

Race Dirty
If done right, you can knock the other cars into a part of the track that they've already been on, or aren't supposed to go to yet, and their lap won't count.

The year is 2525. The United Nations are the target for a major covert attack by terrorists. Their devious intentions are to destabilize defense systems and to overthrow the allied governments. This covert action is the evil demise of the international terrorist known as "X".

The CIA has just received information which indicates that "X" is near comp- letion of an ultimate war weapon which will enable him to begin his attack. The CIA has sent out their best agents in order to undermine his criminal espionage but all have failed. Finally, they call upon rookie agent Rachel (Code HE03) who has been specially trained in international espionage. Much time passes and she has not yet returned. For fear that "X" has her in his evil grasp, the CIA calls on an unofficial agent in a last desperate attempt to save the world from utter chaos. This agent's code name is SSH "Super Spy Hunter".

Like other entries in the series, Super Turrican for the NES is a side-scrolling platformer in which players explore large levels filled with enemies items and secret areas. Three different, upgradable weapons are available: multiple (spreadshot), laser and rebound. Holding down the fire button activates a rotatable laser that is useful for discovering hidden power-up capsules.

Despite carrying the same name as one of its big brothers, Super Turrican for the NES is based on Turrican and Turrican II. While some levels are very similar to those found in Turrican I and II (with only slight changes of layout and enemy types), others are entirely new.

Apart from different/new level design, there are other notable changes: Holding down the fire button let's Turrican run, there is no time limit to levels anymore, energy wheel usage is limitless and the shield isn't time based anymore, but can sustain a certain number of hits.

Super Xevious is a 2D shoot 'm up by Namco and is part of the Xevious series. Xevious is known as one of the hardest and fastest shooters around and Super Xevious is even harder and faster!

The enemies of the first Xevious game are back! But this time they are not alone. No, the brought some nasty friends with them! It is your job, as a fighter pilot, to blast them away! Destroy everything in sight!

Some ground structures that must be destroyed are hidden and are called Sol Citadels. To locate these hidden structures you must keep an eye on the target-sight that will flash when it goes over the structures.

Super Xevious takes all the great elements of the original Xevious and has also some improvements. Some examples of improvements are, for instance, the shield option and the upgrade option. The shield protects you from immediately death if you got hit during an attack. The upgrade option gives you the possibility to upgrade your bombs, lasers and shields.

Swamp Thing is based on the DC Comics of the same name. Deep in the swamps of Louisiana, a Dr. Holland, is hard at work on a growth formula for plants. His sponsor however has different ideas for the technology and burns down the lab. The poor doctor is burned and covered with formula and inside of the organically rich Bayou swamps... he becomes Swamp Thing.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game. Swamp thing can punch (but not duck and punch) and jump a short distance. Health powerups will be needed to keep him alive and additionally ball powerups can be found to give him a projectile weapon.

    <desc>This is a really nifty RPG by Capcom that is precursor to Resident Evil. What makes it interesting is that the game places a greater emphasis on puzzle-solving than fighting, which makes for an interesting change of pace. Actually, you are far more likely to die in the game itself than in a battle. Wandering around is what you'd expect in any Nes RPG: over-head, tile-based movement. You use a variety of items to solve puzzle in this environment, while randomly encountering enemies. The graphics are really nice, too. The overhead graphics almost remind of Quest of the Avatar for some reason, and the battle graphics and portraits look really nice for the Nes. It's a great game.

Translation Description:

This translation is an accomplishment of well over a year's worth work, which is reflected in the quality of the translation. This isn't a fly-by-night DBZ translation, this is high-quality, kids. You MUST play this game.

Sword Master establishes the tale of an evil wizard in league with a monstrous demon who have dared to kidnap a damsel. The Sword Master is a knight who seeks to rescue the fair lady and destroy the evil people and creatures in the castle in which they dwell.

It is a parallax side-scrolling action game in which the player must use sword and shield to battle through 7 game levels, from the forest, to a cursed town, to multiple levels of the villain's castle lair. The player will encounter giant bats, wolves, skeleton warriors, evil knights, wizards, lizard men, gargoyles, and other fierce enemies on his quest. The Sword Master can swing his sword, defend with his shield, and gather power-ups which enable him to change his form; for example, the Sword Master can transform into a magic user himself and cast offensive magic spells.

Swords and serpents chronicles the journey of four adventurers through the dark depths of a foreboding dungeon. Fierce Monsters, mind numbing puzzles, and crusty old men who give cryptic advice, all stand between our heroes and the riches they seek. In the greatest depths of the dungeon lies the Serpent King, who has plagued the land for hundreds of years. Your quest is simple: Destroy the Serpent King.

Directions:

You begin your quest with the creation of your own party, by rolling stats and choosing each character's class. Both the character generation and combat systems closely resemble popular D&amp;D games. The player must create four characters, choosing from Warrior, Wizard, and Thief classes.

To create these characters, you must first roll for your abilities, which consist of Strength, Intelligence, and Agility. The top score is 19 and the bottom is 1. Then you must choose the character's name and class. The Warrior is more or less the tank of the group, running into combat and beating everything with his sword. His main strength is his... well, Strength. The Thief will help you evade traps, relying on his Agility. The Wizard is the spell caster, with both combat and healing spells. He needs high Intelligence to cast effectively. Your choice of party members determines the experience of the game.

After the party has been created, you begin your exploration of the dungeon. You must take your characters through sixteen levels of mazes, monsters and traps before you can face the mighty Serpent King. To reach and finally defeat him, you will need to build your party into an effective fighting machine, combining the best elements of brawn and brains.

Hints:

To continue the game you are given five passwords to input, one for each player and the fifth for the overall game progress.

Taboo is a simulated Tarot deck. Pretty simple stuff.

Directions:

First the game asks for your name and birth date and gender. Then you get to ask a question, and in typical Gypsy style it gives you a bunch of vague stuff about the cards and the final result is like a fortune cookie with no cookie. Oh, you're supposed to 'influence the shuffling of the deck' with the directional pad. This makes it more personal. Really.

    <desc>It's Sanrio! And you get two games in one cartridge! Such a deal. Er, you're Tabo, and you run around avoiding ghosts and stuff. Tabo's cool because his mouth is perpetually open. Hell yeah! And on occasion he even opens his eyes! How awesome is that? In the Card game, he just runs around flipping cards that match, like Memory or Concentration or something. The Cube game is just weird, because you're sort of shifting rows of blocks to line up blocks of the same type. Trust me, it makes a lot more sense when you play it. So play it!

Translation Description:

Feb. 22nd 2006 Addendum: - Hap's Addendum Patch was released Feb. 18th 2006 and fixes the problem that the game doesn't work on some emulators, and adds a missing translation. This is an unofficial addendum patch.

First off, here is an animated gif of the ending credits, from the old 0.95 patch. InVerse wanted me to add that because he says it's l33t. After the 1.00 release (which screws up the ending for me), I took the liberty of making my own ending sequence. I'm sure it says something about my hentai worship or pedophilia or something, but who can say, really.

As far as I know, this patch (actually, this GAME) will only work in NESticle. I've tried Nesten, FCE Ultra, and about five or six unofficial Nesters, and all I got was a black screen. Choose wisely, kay? Oh, and that image in the lower right is outdated. That cube game is hard, okay? I don't wanna fix it.

Update by Sliver X:

This release (1.01) fixes the ending credits, some glitches, and includes some save states for various NES emulators. Save states, you ask? See the above mentioned inability of the best NES emu's to play the game? Well, these save states can get the game working on them.

Apparently, it's something in the intro that makes emu's choke, so if you can jump past that, you're good to go.

Play tag with maze after maze full of dragons. Catch them if you can! Only adragon's tail is vulnerable, so sneak up from behind and munch till they turnto bones. If you are fast enough to snatch the Magic Lantern, you can discover the secrets buried within the walls of each maze.

Directions:

The object of the game is to outmaneuver the opponent dragons. Run behind themand bite the tail. It will chew off part of it and make it weaker. A weaker dragon is open for attacks from the front as well. The dragon can regain its tail by biting off another dragon's tail. If a dragon is weak and is bitten once more - it dies (turns into a skeleton). The player must us appropriate tactics by observing each dragon's tail. For example, if dragons of equal tails approach each other head on, the snapping dragon will hurt the dragon with a closed jaw. If one has a shorter tail, he cannot defeat the other even if he snaps.

There is a time limit on each level. The time indicator is in the lower left corner along with the amount of dragon's left and the player's score.

There are several objects in a zone you can pick up or destroy. The basic hedges that divide the area can be eaten after you have picked up a special lantern. The metal blocks cannot be removed and are permanent obstacles.

Not every area is the same. If there is ice on the floor you will run through them very quickly and cannot control your movement. Another zone is called "Time Zone", which kill you if you stay in them for too long.

Items:

Magic Lantern:
Enables the dragon to eat up the hedges in a maze, to reveal more bonus items.

Dragon Egg:
Extra live.

Light:
300 points.

Fire Capsule:
300 points.

Corn:

Fruits:
300 points.

Cherries:

Directions:

You team with a partner to fight another team of two for a trophy! If you win the match, you get a trophy. If you win, the trophy gets bigger.

B Button: Select manuever, tag in partner
Start Button: Start game, pause/unpause
Select Button: Select between 1 or 2 Players

Hints:

As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".

    <desc>Taro's Quest is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1989.

This is the US translated prototype version of the Japanese game.  It's not clear exactly how far the translation went.  It is a Dragon Warrior type RPG.  ~Rx

T&amp;C Surf Designs II: Thrilla's Surfari is a sequel to the original, Town &amp; Country Surf Designs: Wood &amp; Water Rage for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game system. The game features Thrilla Gorilla, a surfing/skateboarding mascot of the company, Town &amp; Country Surf Designs , on a quest to save his girlfriend who has been kidnapped, as you find out in the opening scenes.

Gameplay involves steering Thrilla around obstacles, over pits and past creatures while collecting coconuts used in the shell game to gain extra lives, bananas to gain extra life, and powerups such as the handstand powerup which grants temporary invulnerability to all manners of danger but pitfalls.

O.K. dudes, the time has come to really get radical. You and the rest of "DA BOYS," T&amp;C's famous group of skate and surf crazies, can kick out 
and pull off some awesome maneuvers together.

Whether you're jammin' the ramps, jumping the cracks, riding the rails or just laying back tall, the skate action is hotter than hot!

...and when you hit the beach to rip up the surf you'll be face to face with some of the most explosive swells around. Execute some low, hard 
bottom turns, flawless spinouts or just skate the lip in order to rack up some serious points on your way to becoming the ultimate skate and surf 
champion. This action is hardcore... and it's your turn.

--From the NES T&amp;C Surf Designs instruction manual.

Overview:

You can't tell by the title but this is a surfing game. Well, it's also a skating game. If you like a skill based game, this is a good one to try out. It can 
be difficult to get the controls down at first, especially for surfing, but it is a pretty addictive game once you're used to it.

It side-scrolls and the background repeats itself a lot, since you redo part of the board over again at the start of new rounds, but it's still fun to play. 
Watching them wipe out makes me hurt. Their chin drags the ground and you can see the heat. The music is a kind of campy rock, but at least it 
isn't annoying.

Directions:

There are three options on the Selection screen: Street Skate Session, Big Wave Encounter, and Wood and Water Rage. Street Skate Session is 
only skating, Big Wave Encounter only surfing, and Wood and Water Rage alternates between the two.

Street Skate Session: Speed is king.
You're timed and maintaining a high speed earns you life so it's in your interest to keep up the pace. Choose from either Joe Cool or Tiki Man to get 
your skate on, and if you can't tell which is which then you're a square, man! Each wipe out costs you time and life (happenin' lil' yin yang shapes 
in hip tones of orange and yellow), run out of either and it's game over. Catch coins to add to your score. Jump onto some things that would normally
be hazards and turn them into points, i.e. toy cars, turtles, etc. Grind a high rail or take a ramp jump for bonus points as well. Time and life left over
at the end of a round also add to your score.

Big Wave Encounter: Choose your man, er, animal: Thrilla Gorilla or Kool Kat. This one is really tough and requires fine controlling. Surf long and
fast to increase your life. Reach the beach past the piers to end a round. Life left over at the end of a round adds to your score. Gain points for 
simply surfing without falling, but then it may not be so simple. Pull off turns to gain points and for third turns gain 1 extra life symbol. Gain points 
for surfing just inside the pipeline (where the wave forms a tunnel behind you) but be careful! One wrong move in there and you'll be lost! Pick up 
bananas floating in the surf for bonus points and watch out for other things floating in the surf or flying just above it or flying up out of it, or really 
just anything besides bananas that'll knock you off your board. Note: pier supports are hazardous to your health as well, so don't get reckless in 
the home stretch. 

Controls:

Start Button: Starts Game, Pauses Game
Select Button: Moves you around the menu

Skating
A Button: Jump off board
A Button and Back: Ollie (jump while holding board)
B Button: Tap to speed up

Surfing

Hints:

Time Stop Skating
Keep your speed up to fill your life, once your life is completely full, time ceases to be a problem! That is, unless you crash.

    <desc>I was fortunate enough to play this game on cart at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where Sardius very narrowly beat me. However, I thoroughly trounced him in another game that night, so I guess we're even. If you can call a sound defeat "even."

Anyway, this is a game in the glorious Technos series of games, in which people beat the hell out of each other while doing various things. Think Nintendo World Cup on ice, I guess. Except with a lot more beatings, and variety and stuff. You're the hockey team at school, and you're playing all the other sports teams at school. It sounds odd, but who cares - when you beat a team you get the option of using their uniforms, which also includes the ability to use their special attacks. It's a hell of a lot of fun, believe you me. As you can well imagine, beating your opponent unconscious is one of life's little pleasures, and this game manages to faithfully reproduce that same experience. And the first game is soooo much fun, because you can easily kick their ass. Who says only challenging games are fun?

Oh, and this is the game that was almost going to be released in the States as "Crash n the Boys - Ice Challenge". In case you were dying to know.

Translation Description:

TransBRC's translation is pretty odd, especially the "Americanization" of a lot of the names. Look out Kunio, here comes Ric! Oh well, it's complete and it's playable, so who cares? Right?

    <desc>Of the extremely little I've played of River City Ransom, I would say that Technos Samurai is a lot like it. Except Technos Samurai is much more Japanese, and a whole hell of a lot more confusing. I played the game for a long time, and not only did I not know what I was doing, I forgot what I was supposed to have BEEN doing. If that makes sense, anyway. You pretty much just run around Japan, looking for enemies to fight.. And after you've cleared a screen of enemies, then you fight the boss of the enemies, who may or may not tell you something afterwards. But it's fun, and you certainly do fight a lot, so who's complaining? It's Technos, so have fun and stuff.

Translation Description:

Be sure and skim through the readme and FAQ before you start playing. Aside from the interesting translation notes, there's some stuff in there that's absolutely essential to know if you actually want to know what you're doing in the game.

Tecmo Baseball is a video game developed by Tecmo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in January 1989, it was a game for baseball. There were three modes for the game; 1 player, 2 player, and watch. In addition to games between teams, there was also an all-star game with the best players in the game. The game has become very popular on college campuses.[citation needed] One of the major drawbacks of this game is that the pitchers become tired after only a few innings.

There was a National division (comparable to the National League) and an American division (comparable to the American League, although both divisions only featured seven teams each. The National teams were: St. Louis, San Francisco, New York, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Chicago. The American division teams were: Minnesota, Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Boston, California, and Texas.

All the players on the teams had names and statistics similar to those of real Major League ballplayers. A player on the Detroit team was named Arex but his statistics were those that Alan Trammell of the Detroit Tigers had in 1987. The best teams in the game were St. Louis and Minnesota, the two teams that also played each other in the 1987 World Series.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Tecmo Bowl on NES is not the first home console football game and is certainly nowhere near as realistic as today's versions, but it has to be the first fun football game in video game history. It may be the first with actual 11 man teams, but don't quote me on that. Featuring 12 NFL teams with rosters full of actual players on those teams at that time, you can play such greats as Walter Payton or Tony Dorsett. 

Tecmo Bowl features all of the facets of the game: running, passing and kicking. You play 4 quarters of 1:30 each, which doesn't sound like much time, but it's plenty. There are no penalties, however. Gameplay is smooth and controls respond very well. Avoiding tacklers is kind of tough, but can be done. They are faster than you in the open field, but you can dodge them when they dive at you. Passing the ball is pretty easy because your receivers always catch the ball when they are open. If they are covered by a defensive player, it almost always results in an intercepted pass for the defense. Kicking field goals is easy, too. You do not have to aim your kick, just hit the meter at full and you can make them from the 50 yard line or closer.

The graphics are of the Nintendo era, of course, but if you are a fan of this game, it doesn't matter. It's very musical with various different themes for scoring, end of a quarter or at halftime, and during gameplay. Tecmo Bowl can provide hours of fun, either head to head with a friend, or in 1 player mode versus the computer. A Japanese original combined with an American original, and what a combo it was. 

Directions:

Two teams are matched up on a playing field of 100 yards. At each end of the field are designated goals, or endzones: one side is your goal, the other is your opponent's. You try to prevent your opponent from reaching your goal and scoring. Score takes place by either: Moving the ball into the endzone (goal) for a touchdown and six points, or by kicking the ball through the goalposts for a fieldgoal and 3 points. After a touchdown has been scored, you attempt a short field goal for 1 extra point. You can also score 2 by tackling an opponent with the ball in his endzone. 

When you have the ball on offense, you have 4 tries or "downs" to move the ball 10 yards or more. If you succeed, you are awarded a first down and another four downs. If you fail to move the 10 yards in four downs, your opponent gets the ball and you must play defense. Usually, on fourth down, you would either punt the ball to your opponent to move him further from your endzone, or attempt a field goal if you are in range.

On offense you select from 4 different plays, two running plays and two passing plays, before play begins. Each play is shown on the screen and is selected by with directional and A corresponding to a controller diagram below the play. Your team lines up and ball is put in play by pushing A. When passing the ball, A cycles through your receivers and press B to throw the ball. For running plays, press A when your team lines up and the quarterback automatically hands the ball to the running back.

When playing defense, you pick a play you think your opponent is going to use. When the other team lines up, select a defender to control during that play using A. If you pick the exact same play as your opponent, your team will fiercely tackle the quarterback or running back.

To kick the ball, press B when you are selecting plays. A window will pop up with the option to punt or field goal. Move the cursor over your selection and press A. When your team lines up, for either punt or field goal, press A to put the ball in play. When the ball has been snapped, a meter will appear in the corner of the screen above the kicker. Press A again when the meter gets full or near full. 

Controls:

D Pad: Used for moving players, selecting play formations, and other operations.
Select Button: Used for selecting play mode. (One player, two player, and coach mode.)
Start Button: Used for starting plays.
A Button: Used for hiking the ball, choosing the receiver, kicking and, other operations.
B Button: Used for pass plays, diving tackles, and other operations.

Hints:

Dodging Tackles
When running from defenders, run at an angle and alternate between up and down. This will make some defenders dive at you and miss.

Tecmo Cup Soccer Game (known as Captain Tsubasa in Japan) is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1992 by Tecmo, it is a football (soccer) game. In the game you must fight your way from junior league all the way to the finals of World Cup.

Tecmo Cup Soccer Game is a heavily Americanized version of Japanese Captain Tsubasa football (soccer) game released for the Famicom system, featuring a different main character, a different introduction and more western-looking players. The game contains elements from role-playing games as the players have skill levels and are mostly controlled by different kinds of text commands. Because of the unusual interface and presentation, Tecmo Cup Soccer Game did not attract casual gamers in its time and therefore had a relatively small fanbase.

After the initial success of Tecmo Bowl, Tecmo followed up with the release of Tecmo Super Bowl in 1991. The company was able to obtain the NFL's team license, making it the first game to feature all 28 NFL teams of the day. It became a great success because of its mixture of realism and gameplay. TSB also included the real players of each team, rated realistically, with the exception of Jim Kelly, Randall Cunningham, and Bernie Kosar, who were represented by generic names: QB Bills, QB Eagles, and QB Browns, respectively. This was because those players were not members of the National Football League Players Association union and their likenesses were not allowed to be used.

However, the Super NES version had their names, but did not have the names of the Bears' kicker or the Bengals' punter. Each team had 11 players on the field at a time, as in real football. There were separate rosters for Offense and Defense, plus the ability to substitute players on Offense, with the exception of the offensive line. Another groundbreaking feature was the full-length NFL regular and postseason schedule for 1991 (including the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl games). These are now common ideas, but they had only rarely been seen in a video game at that time, and certainly not at all for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Tecmo Super Bowl retained the arcade-style football gameplay of the original, including the unique ability to break tackles, but it was more refined and deeper than its predecessor. It added new features, such as statistics, more plays, editable playbooks, fumbles, and player injuries. The game's use of detailed cutscenes for important events like touchdowns, halftime shows, injuries, and big plays was also unprecedented at the time.

Can you get to the Super Bowl?


Based off of Tecmo Super Bowl, but this game is so entirely different that it is basically an original game. 

In the words of the programmer:

"In typical Tecmo Super Bowl, you can control the players. This game is more defined for a coaching experience, though. I've even taken some of the 'manual' elements out of the game to enhance the coaching experience. That being said, now having priority WRs that the QB selects makes the strategy and 'option selecting' better defined, which in turn, gives more 'control' to the coaching aspect."

What's NEW in Tecmo Super Coach?

TECMO SUPER COACH 2009-10: { Real Men Coach.}

The TSC Instruction Book can be found at the Author's Web site: 

http://www.supertecmobowl.com/tsc_instructions/index.html

GAME PLAY DESCRIPTION:

Most importantly, changed in Tecmo Super Bowl is a complete tightening of its legendary football gaming experience, through creating in it specific custom Defensive formations in response to the Offense chosen by the opposing Human or CPU-controlled player. Defensive formations, in combination with a total "Tecmo Super Coach" graphic re-branding, Offensive game play overhaul, and hundreds upon hundreds of hours invested equates to the most complete TSB coaching experience ever!

GAME PLAY DETAILS:

Previously, Tecmo Super Bowl had very unspecific Defensive reactions. Any controller option selected by the Defensive to confront the Offense with was, more-or-less, randomly selected by the player with no notation of what was being chosen, or why. The goal of the original TSB was for the player on Defense to pick the same play as the opposing Offense, which would send all of your Defensive players 'blitzing' towards the ball carrier. Ultimately, this feat would be your only true success in the game on the Defensive play-calling side of the ball.

What I have done, along with a handful of talented Tecmo Super Bowl enthusiasts, is recode each and every individual player AI reaction so that both Offensive and Defensive sides of the ball work together to create a more fluid football gaming simulation. In addition to dozens of visual and functional game engine mechanics, every modification in Tecmo Super Coach has been made to compliment, specifically, the coaching experience of the game, and to provide what I view as a more simplified (some might say 'chill') version of a more authentic TSB football experience!

QB SPECIFICS:

Also previously found in Tecmo Super Bowl was a set pattern of extremely sloppy Quarterback AI. As a coaching player, you often didn't see the kind of results you would have liked in the QB decision-making process. Quarterbacks now scramble less, throw faster, and react quicker to Defensive pressure!

GENERAL MODIFICATIONS LIST:

- Complete "Tecmo Super Coach" graphical re-branding
- Complete 2009-2010 NFL 'End of Season' Rosters update
- Complete Custom Defensive Playbook creation
- Complete Offensive Playbook integration
- New Offensive Plays
- Dozens of Game Play Hacks and Edits
- And much, much more!

Between tournament matches, the player is given an option to train with his female trainer. He can chose to do button mashing exercises, either squats, situps, or push-ups (with a sumo wrestler on his back). Successfully completing training increases the character's fighting abilities. When all the competitors are defeated, the player must overcome the challenge of the final boss, Blue King The Manic Warrior, a nonplayable character, before winning the game.

Sun. Sand. Surfboards. Shredder? Talk about a party pooper. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles try to take up a vacation only to have it cut short by Shredder's shadiest sham yet. He'll stop at nothing for revenge. This time that ice-hearted anti-hero made off with the entire island of Manhattan. His sinister alien ally Krang has given him the technology to rip the bustling borough from its earthly ties with a rumbling earthquake and lift it into the sky. If our holiday heroes ever want to see April O'Neil and the Big Apple in one piece again, they've got to burn rubber and get back home!

DO THE SHELL SHOCK ROCK

Getting back to Manhattan will be no smooth sail. You'll have to use every modus travelus imaginable, including jet surfboards, a battleship, a blimp and your own ingenuity. Here's why. Shredder's set up dastardly detours every inch of the way with the most mindless meat-ripping maniacs ever to have a taste for turtle. And he's taught them quite a few new treacherous tricks. The burliest beasts of all await at the end of all 8 totally awesome levels. But keep that melon of a chin up; you've got some stunning new moves yourself. You can take out enemies and rack up points for the good guys. So suit up with the turtle of your choice and prove that crime and late pizza deliveries never pay.

--From the NES Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

After a victory over their nemesis, The Shredder, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles decide to go to Florida to take a vacation. While watching television, they learn that Manhattan is being pulled into the sky by a giant spaceship! Like always, the Turtles grab their weapons for another adventure!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 is similar to the other TMNT games in terms of graphics and sound. Well, the music and sound effects are all recycled, so it gives the series some continuity. At least they're good music and sounds (Slash! Pow!). The characters are drawn and animated well, and the backgrounds are nicely done as well.

Directions:

This game is very similar to the other games, so if your a fan of the Turtles' NES games, you pretty much know the drill.

If you press A and B together, you can execute a special attack. Each turtle has a different one. If you die, you can select a new turtle if you want or keep the one you selected. Either way, you'll still lose a REST. You'll run into a boss at the end, so be ready for anything he'll dish out! 

Controls:

A Button: Jump, attack while holding B
B Button: Attack, Jab and Toss while holding Down
Start Button: Pause/Unpause, confirm selections
Select Button: Switch between selection on title menu

Hints:

Stage Select
While on the title screen, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, Start to activate the Stage Select!

Welcome to the crime infested boroughs of New York, where one wrong look at the right person can be your last. But the turtles sleep contentedly, for they've made Manhattan a safer place for all. Especially since they've sent Shredder to the local landfill. Or so they think.

While dreams of pepperoni pizzas dance through their heads, the turtles' worst nightmares blast into Earth's atmosphere. Two intergalactic bounty hunters have been attracted by the price Shredder has placed on the half shell heroes' heads. Shredder's alive and looking for payback!

Although the turtles tossed Shredder into the metal jaws of a garbage truck, his titanium battle helmet protected his maniacal mind from being mauled. Upon awakening on a seabound garbage ship, Shredder vowed vengeance.

After floating back to land on a pile of non-biodegradable styrofoam cups, Shredder began training a new breed of Foot Soldier. One that is better trained in the lethal art of Taekwondo. And one that will make the ultimate sacrifice to defend his leader. But that was only the beginning. Shredder journeyed throughout the universe, via his Translocation Matrix Beam, recruiting the top bounty hunters. He chose two.

Tora is a ten foot, half ton blizzard beast who, in 2000 years, has never known defeat. Journeying from the distant ice planet of Traglodoon, he has come to Earth needing only one weapon, his devastating claws. His partner in cosmic crime is Shogun, an inhabitant of Sector Six in the Dead Star Zone, and the mastermind behind the Ultimate Galactic Sword.

But that's not all, folks. Shredder and his professional punishers have again captured April O'Neil and plan to use her as turtle bait. Fail to save this lovely journalist, and that's all she wrote!

Shredder's ten levels of terror, with a lethal leader at the end of each one, are the deadliest the turtles have ever had to face. Even if you survive the eight action riddled arcade areas, you still must contend with the two new unbeatable bounty hunter stages. But the turtles stand ready to fight through this shell squashing mess. For Splinter has taught these turtles to fight with the ferocity of a lion.

--From the NES Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

After the so-called demise of The Shredder, the Turtles have been chillin' for a while. Then Shredder came back and vowed revenge on the 4 Turtles! He also teaches his ninjas Taekwando, which will make them more dangerous! He used his Translocation Matrix Beam to recruit some great bounty hunters, Tora and Shogun! Shredder kidnaps April, to lure the Turtles into his trap. Splinter also gets captured, which adds quite a twist to the plot. So get ready for another shell-shockin' game, dudes!

Directions:

You can choose between 4 turtles: Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelango, and Raphael. Each turtle has their own different style. But you probably already know that. Moving on, you fight through 8 stages of grueling butt-kicking action, each ending with their own boss!

Controls:

A Button: Jump, jump attack while pressing B
B Button: Attack, Jump attack while pressing A
Start Button: Pause/Unpause
Select Button: Select between 1 or 2 Turtles

Hints:

Steam rises from Wall Street sewers like hot breath from a pack of wild dogs. Just below the pavement's puddle strewn surface, the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles(r) have gathered around the leftovers of a family-reunion-sized sausage pizza with extra sausage. Usually these party dudes would inhale the mozzarella platter as if it were the last "za" on earth, but not tonight.

You see, only hours ago, their trusted friend, April(tm), was kidnapped from her mobile news van by the vile, ruthless, terrorist bully SHREDDER(tm)! He's a Slice-O-Matic crum, a villain more vicious than an army of mind altered Bruce Lees.

With their lovely cohort held hostage, the fearless foursome must concoct a way to rescue April before Shredder brain washes her into joining his Ninjitsu Foot Clan. They'll combine this treacherous task with the mission they've had since their mutated beginnings - to thrash Shredder and capture his Life Transformer Gun, the lone piece of technology that can turn their rat friend, Splinter(tm), back into the man he used to be.

So take control of these heroes in a half shell, and either claim total victory over New York's premier Kick Man... or lead them onto the menu at McTurtles (Home of the Quarter Flounder with Cheese).

--From the NES Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles instruction manual.

Directions:

You'll start out as Leonardo, but you can change to any other turtle by pressing start and selecting another turtle from the menu. 

- Leonardo - Leonardo Leads, he's the middle turtle. His range is decent and he's not that slow

- Donatello - Donatello does machines, his Bo has the longest range, and can hit enemies behind him.

- Raphael - Raphael is cool but rude, his sais are short range but they come out fast.

- Michelangelo - Michelangelo's a party dude, a lot like Leonardo. A middle character.

There are three types of game areas.

- OverWorld: This is the area that has the top down view. You can use your basic attacks to stop any foot soldiers that try to stop you. Watch out for the steam rollers thought because they kill you instantly.

- Battle stages: Here you've got your full arsenal. Enemies swarm and you'll wish the control was more responsive.

- Underwater stages: Tap A to swim up, tap B to swim down. Avoid the electrical barriers and defuse the bombs. Watch out! You've got a time limit! 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use weapon
Start Button: Start game, pause/unpause game, bring up menu while in play
Select Button: Switch weapon

Hints:

Boomerang makes the world go round
The boomerang. Get it and keep it. The boomerang is your best friend. As long as you catch it you have infinite ammo.

TETRIS is a dynamic puzzle that seems easy enough: Rotate and flip moving geometric blocks into unbroken rows. When you completely fill up the bottom row, it disappears from the screen and your score rises. When enough rows vanish, the blocks descend faster and faster. Nothing to it, right? Wrong! When you can't find the way to make the pieces fit together and more blocks tumble down to clog your screen, you'll wish you had ten hands - and ten brains. Warning: Although TETRIS may be great food for thought, it's so much fun, it's positively addictive. So don't forget to eat something to fuel your body (maybe apple pie?).

Tennis is a video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The concept of the game is very basic in that the player controls one person faced against an opponent CPU player. This game uses the same scoring system as "real-life" tennis. The game also features a doubles (2-player) option. The opponent CPU player can be set at 5 difficulties.

All the excitement of the original movie is rolled into one awesome video game for the SNES. Play as Kyle Reese, the hero who's gone back in time to help Sarah Conner escape fellow time-traveler, the Cyberdyne Systems model 101 (AKA the Terminator.) Eventually, Sarah's son will be the leader of an important social resistance unless, of course, the Terminator catches her and ends any hope for human life.

Featuring six levels of white-knuckle gameplay, THE TERMINATOR furnishes you with lots of awesome weaponry and you'll really need every bit of it if you hope to reckon with the hyper-alloy robot chassis and human flesh of your evil friend. Polish your reflexes and lose all sense of remorse--it's time to become a mercenary. Six levels; excitement based on the movie; awesome weapons; cool graphics; two-player action.

Numbered bases release power-ups when shot - these can either be used in combination or (by pressing the space bar) in Formation Mode, covering a wider range of shooting positions. Each pass over the planet ends with a boss; the third and final one with a boss who can only be killed if you are at maximum power. Death puts you back to the start of the world.

    <desc>At first glance, this may just appear to be a neat little Space Harrier-type game, but actually it turns out to be a really cool neat little Space Harrier-type game. I know the screenshots are kind of confusing and don't really show much, but it really has to be seen to be appreciated.. Some of the effects are just incredible, especially for the NES. Not much to be said about the gameplay, really.. You fly around and shoot stuff. However, the tricky part is that you also have to dodge all the stuff that might kill you. That's the part that most people have trouble with, anyway. I don't know, maybe it's more complicated than that, but I never bothered to find out. I just kept hitting the B button. And that's good enough for me, dammit.

Translation Description:

This game has a surprising amount of story for a shooter. Fortunately everything is translated, so enjoy dammit!

Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.

The Birth of a New Tetris

Tetris 2 is a new edition to the family of puzzle games that began with the megahit, Tetris. Tetris 2 consists of red, green, and yellow blocks. In the original Tetris game, the object was to erase the blocks by arranging them horizontally across the screen. However, in Tetris 2, your goal is to arrange three blocks of the same color vertically or horizontally. This will cause the set of three blocks to disappear. While maintaining the "simple, but fun" tradition that was started with the original Tetris, Tetris 2 moves ahead as a game that is even more challenging and more fun to play.

--From the NES Tetris 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

Raindrops keep falling on my head, or in this case, block groups. The objective of the game is simple; erase blocks by arranging three blocks of the same color either horizontally or vertically, which will cause the three aligned blocks to disappear. Since you cannot start a nuclear war by playing Tetris2, simply begin the game and learn as you go. There are game options which you might explore at your leisure. Tetris was a MAJOR hit when it debuted and fans of it should be happy to have another challenge.

You can select from four choices of background music, none with that over-the-top-treble so you should be able to find some tunes that are enjoyable to play by. The action sounds include some nice explosion sounds whenever blocks are eliminated.

The graphics are excellent, with shading on the blocks, and the backgrounds come in various shapes that should keep you from becoming bored. The colors are somewhat subtle, not glaring, which you might or might not like.

As with the original game, the falling of the blocks speeds up as you advance. Or maybe I just slow down.

Directions:

Turn the falling blocks in the orientation you desire and move them to where you need them using the Control Pad, and accept the consequences. "Down" causes the blocks to fall more quickly.

There are, in addition to the falling blocks, "Flash Blocks" and "Fixed Blocks".

If you erase a "Flash Blocks" of a particular color (red, green or yellow) all fallen blocks of the same color on the screen will disappear. If you eliminate all of the different colored "Flash Blocks" you advance to the next level. If you eliminate all of the "Fixed Blocks", you will also advance to the next level. And of course, you receive points and bonus points for all of your hard work.

The Two player option apparently just places two Tetris screens beside each other. If you find another arrangement consider yourself lucky. I didn't.

Controls:

A Button: Clockwise
B Button: Counter-Clockwise
Down: Speed Downward
Start Button: Start, Pause

TETRIS is a new type of puzzle game from the Soviet Union that tests your reflexes. It's really simple to play. Seven different shaped blocks fall down the game field one after the other. The object of the game is to keep the blocks from piling up to the top of the game field. To do this, you can move blocks to the left and right, and rotate them as they fall. If you can completely fill in one horizontal line, that line disappears and you get points. If the blocks pile up to the top of the game field, then that's the end of the game. TETRIS is simple, easy-to-understand, but difficult to drag yourself away from!

TETRIS originally came from the word "tetra" meaning the number 4. By rearranging four squares, you can make seven different shapes which are the pieces used in this game.

--From the NES Tetris instruction manual.

Overview:

When this game was released in 1989, it became an instant classic, along with Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros. and many others! The Russian-themed music got into everyone's head, and people were playing Tetris even in their sleep. A huge hit that started a new era in video gaming.

Directions:

In this classic game, you must get through as many lines as possible! There are two modes: A and B. In Mode A, if you destroy 10 lines, you move up one level. In Mode B, you must destroy 25 lines! The Tetris pieces come in many shapes and forms, so use different tactics to prevail!

Controls:

A Button: Rotate pieces to the left
B Button: Rotate pieces to the right
Start Button: Pause/Unpause, make selections
Select Button: Hide preview of next piece

Hints:

Start With 4 Free Lines on B-Type Game
Start the game and wait for the demo. When the computer eliminates the four lines at once (makes a tetris), and the screen begins to flash, press start. Now start a B-type game. The screen will flash, and you will start with extra points plus 4 less lines to eliminate.

Warp 10 levels ahead
Select the level you want to go to and hold A, then press START, you will be 10 levels ahead.

The Three Stooges come upon an old widow, her three daughters and their orphanage, which is in extreme disrepair. On top of that, an unscrupulous banker demands the mortgage payment of $5000 within thirty days. The trio immediately sets out to collect the money. Several options for getting (or not getting) money are presented: from dropped wallets to finder's fees to participating in competitions: Hospital, Boxing, Pie Serving, Radio Quiz, and "Dough Balls in the Soup".

There is also an interesting option which seems trivial at first, but becomes important as the game progresses: Each day, the choice of options is made by a hand moving randomly between several panels, which also includes a mouse trap. As the days pass, the hand speeds up, and if the player is not careful, he will lose a finger to the trap(s) (and if all fingers are disabled, the game is over). With a special option, the speed can be reduced by having the Stooges "blow off steam"; the player controls Moe as he attempts to hit either Larry or Curly, and for each hit the selection speed is reduced.

Each of the pilots have been assigned a particular ship, but only DR. BRAIN can visualize the global extent of HOOD's plants - and even he can't comprehend the full dimensions of the scheme. But as DR. BRAIN determines the targets of HOOD's attacks, he'll mark them on a world map in yellow.

When you choose to take on a site, the marker will change to a blue triangle. When a site has been neutralized, it turns pink. Due to the massive nature of HOOD's threat, it will take him 60 days to ready his power source. But that doesn't help the TBirds much, since a TBird ship damaged in an attack can take 3 days to repain, and there's no guarantee that DR. BRANI can determine all of the places the TBirds will need to attack when he first evaluates HOOD's scheme. So, there's no time to waste!

    <desc>This is one strange pirate/unlicensed/whatever the heck it is. Well, the cover and title is ripped off from what we know as Mega Man X, but the actual game itself is completely new, nothing stolen... good thing or bad thing... that's the question.

Storyline: I can only guess it's a rip-off of the Mega Man X story except you're this blue and white superhero dude who throws boomerangs, named Rocman X. In Gadem City, people are celebrating its 100th anniversary when the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy is kidnapped! A guy by the name of Havel threatens the city by demanding 20 billion dollars (this Dr. Wily is a tad greedy) to support his gang: Paulung-Tang (cheap as well. No wonder his robots suck). A superhero by the name of Rocman X (who doesn't know how to spell rock) must rescue Miss Lucy and make Gadem City as peaceful as it was before and forever defeat the Paulung-Tang gang.

Graphics: The graphics are a tad cartoonish and the enemies are boring to look at and Rocman X doesn't look the greatest either. When you start off the game you are greeted with a stolen title screen from the Famicom version of Mega Man, Rockman... this is not to be associated with this crap! The enemies are all Mega Man-like; strange robots that have weird personas about them; bats that swoop at you, Scorpions that try to sting you, etc. At least the graphics are more detailed then they could've been. Credit for Sachen for that at least.

Sound: It's pretty bad. There's not one tune that sticks in my head. The sound effects are as horrible as possible and not worth talking about. I guess you got to give them credit for having their own custom "bling" noise when you push start to play the game instead of using the one from Rockman for Famicom.

Gameplay: Basically, it's a mixture of Mega Man/Mega Man X, as you get to choose a stage and it also has at least one element of Power Blade; a Mega Man-like game which competes. Just like in Power Blade, you throw boomerangs but in this game it's one at a time and more of a chore than anything related to fun. Upon killing an enemy you either get a coin which accounts for money (worthless?) or a pill which regains your health which you'll need. Despite the dude has 16 blocks of health, he drops like a rock. I think one hit takes 4 out of him from touching bad guys and 2 for getting hit by a fireball.

There's only three stages in the entire game and they all drag on. I think when you beat a stage (there's no boss) it sends you to an extra stage which is the same one but is has different stuff in it. Another Mega Man trademark is used when the words, "Ready !" flash on the screen every time you enter a stage.

Control: The controls are pretty decent; "B" fires boomerang, "A" jumps, "Start" is pause, and the control pad controls your dude. That's as good as it gets. You character seems to be out-run by all enemies and it takes a while for Rocman to even shoot a boomerang. By holding "B" you can flash like Mega Man X could, but you have to push a direction on the control pad to make this move work. The move? Not a huge "kamehameha-like" blast that kicks ass, but Rocman launches forth like Superman and gets hurt if he knocks into enemies. Nice move. Sad thing is, is that it was probably put into the game by Sachen so that the impossible jumps could be launched over instead. Very sad indeed.

Fun Factor: The storyline intro that plays when you don't push any buttons is pretty fun, but that sadly is where the fun stops... it only gets worse from there! I mentioned before that you die too easily but at least you are given one continue to come back at the exact spot you died at. After that however, your doomed to head right back to the start, then you either close out of FCE Ultra or turn the power off on the NES!

Frustration: In this game you die way too easily. The enemies are allowed all these cheap shots on you and Rocman is so slow he can't dodge anything. All Rocman has is his trusty good-for-nothing boomerang which cannot kill anyone in one hit. Borrowed from Power Blade or not, you can only fire one boomerang at a time which affects your time alive in the game dramatically. Also, the jumps you have to make in this game are impossible. Sometimes you fall through platforms and into spikes! You are forced to use the stupid power-up move that Rocman does and risk hitting an enemy just to get across a gap. Did I mention the guy loses more health than necessary? Yeah, it's harder than any real Mega Man game could ever be.

BOTTOM LINE: Rocman X is one of those games that's better off hard to find; trust me. Imagine buying this for 30 bucks thinking it's the NES version of Mega Man X! Overall, this game had the stuff to become a classic; good idea, good graphics, and good storyline but somehow managed to screw up. If only Sachen gave it a name and fixed up the code better it would've actually been a Mega Man clone and not a Mega Man rip-off!

    <desc>Sly Dog Studios debuts on the Nintendo Entertainment system with Tic-Tac XO! Not being a regular game of tic-tac-toe, you can gain power-ups to up your game and demolish the computer. Power-ups include the ability to take an extra turn, change one of the computer's tiles, clear a row, and clear a column.

If you have a need to play tic-tac-toe, but need an extra boost in your game, look no further than Tic-Tac XO!

Much more than a reproduction, this original game cartridge is built using all new parts. No donor carts were harmed in the making of this game.

The game is a vertical scrolling shooter where the player controls a helicopter taking on hordes of enemies which include tanks, battleships, and artillery. It is interesting to note that, besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. The player's main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles which travel a max distance of half the screen's height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large circular radius. These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets.

The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length previous. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players powerups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player's helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totalling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing powerups when not necessary yields 5000 points.

In 306 B.C. Lou Ban, the most acclaimed artist of the Chin clan, sculpted from the finest ivory, 7 sets of enchanted Tiles. Legends say the original set of Tiles was created by gods and played as a game. Wizards said when played by mortals, it was an art that could be used to predict the future. Priests said it was a dangerous gamble that actually altered the flow of fate. Soon the art of the Tiles had spread across the whole of China, but with it something strange was also spreading. Droughts and then flooding, terrible famines and then gigantic harvests. Everyday something more strange and unlikely would occur, the forces of fate had indeed been blown out of control. The influence of the Tiles on the land of China had to come to an end, but it would not be easy. Like the force of Yin &amp; Yang, each Tile has a match that when united, will allow both Tiles to achieve symmetry, and simply cease to exist. You must conquer 7 castles to defeat 7 sets of Tiles.

It will take more than quick reflexes - you must use strategy, skill and luck to defeat the TILES OF FATE!

    <desc>Time Zone is one of those seemingly hallucinogenically inspired japanese platform games that never saw the light of day in western markets. You take on the role of some little kid who's girlfriend is kidnapped by the evil Professor Time (Oooooh!), for reasons not quite mentioned. Is he a perverted kidnapper? A lonely old man looking for a surrogate granddaughter? Perhaps the world will never know, but his ass needs kicked regardless. Unfortunatly, Dr. Time has a habit of dropping large rocks on your head and jumping into different time periods, which of course you end up going to as well. To help you defeat the legions of walking traffic signs, dinosaurs, and depictions of native americans that would make even Archie Bunker say "Damn!", you're armed with your lucky red hat. Yes, a hat, but not your every day, run of the mill hat, by god! This one has the magical ability to come back to you like a boomerang, with physics that remind me heavily of the Windmill Shuriken from Ninja Gaiden.

Also dispersed throughout the game are little trivia levels, which from what I see amount to counting crap that flies by on the screen. But wait, there's more! If you collect enough little bells and make the smiley alarm clock on the status screen hit midnight, you'll turn into an invincible skateboarder, which I guess is because skate boarding is "totally radical, dude!", or something. Overall, this is a pretty fun little platformer, with pretty solid controls, decent music, and whacky ass enemies to kill.

Translation Description:

Well, the game's complete, and very very nice. So yay!

When the Tiny Toons Plucky Duck, Hamton, Furrball, Babs Bunny, and Buster Bunny are invited to a new amusement park, they're bursting with excitement and anticipation. But once they're inside the park Wackyland the Toons realize they're in trouble, because the owner is their archenemy, Montana Max.

The attractions in Wackyland are prank-filled rides disguised as legitimate ones, and it's up to you to help the Toons get through each of the five rides unscathed. Along the way, you'll be confronted by four foes Roderick Rat, Batsy, Arnold the Pit Bull, and Elmyra that will cause all kinds of problems. If you can get through all five rides and survive the traps that are scattered throughout the park, you just might be able to get back home safely.

There's trouble brewing in Acme Acres

The residents of Acme Acres sat on the steps of Acme Looniversity singing the blues. They've been carrying on this way ever since that menace to merriment, Montana Max, kidnapped Babs Bunny. What they wouldn't do to hear just one of her knock-knock jokes again.

You see, it all started during the Animation Festival at Acme Loo. The festival has always been a grand celebration in Acme Acres, highlighted by the acreenings of student films. Every year Montana Max tries to bribe the judges to vote for his film befcause he is accustomed to having his way. He's a rich dude with an attitude. Monty has always been jealous of Buster Bonny and it only made matters worse when Buster won "Best Student Film".

That's when mean-hearted Monty reached maximum boil. He was going to get even if it was the last thing he did. While Babs was on her way to Buster's house to congratulate him on his win, Monty and his thugs lured her away to his mansion with the promise of making her a star. To parade his prize catch, Monty brought a TV station and broadcast a live "na-na-you-can't-catch-me" speech for all of the stunned citizens of Acme Acres to see.

Well Buster was one bummed out bunny. He was even about ready to give up jumping. But here comes his pals Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil and Furrball to pledge their help in rescuing everyone's favorite female bunny. With a little help from you, Buster and his buddies can now set out on their adventure- packed mission to the outer fringes of Acme Acres to rescue Babs. Can they possible survive the slew of snares that Monty had laid out for them? You better get jumping or it'll be "curtains" for our playful pals!

    <desc>Toad's Treasure Quest is my latest SMB 1 romhack. The foundation of this romhack is what makes it special and very fun to play. A fellow romhacker, Googie, put together a rom containing hacks from various open-source Japanese SMB hacks. He then changed all the GFX and sent me the file for a collaboration project. That project ended up dieing unfortunately. But after a couple months, I found myself with some free time and decided to make a new SMB hack using this incredible hack as a starting point.

This hack contained new music, new GFX, conveyor belts, new lead character animations and upside down pipes/piranha plants. None of the levels were actually changed though. So I loaded up SMB Utility and went to town. I created 16 original levels making sure to utilize these cool new features. This romhack is definitely easier than my previous SMB Bowser's Jumping Challenge and the levels flow much more smoothly.

The story involves how Toad came to posses all those useful items in SMB3. In this hack, you search for those warp flutes. Yes, I know Toad doesn't actually give you those flutes in SMB3. Just pretend he finds em and intends on giving them to Mario, but then Toad trips on a Goomba and drops the flutes which then get stolen by Bowser's henchmen.

The hero of the game is a young jungle-man named Toki. One day the evil wizard Dr. Stark kidnaps his girlfriend Wanda. When Toki tries to save her, he is turned into a monkey! Now Toki has to find Dr. Stark in his palace, to rescue Wanda, and to become a human being again!

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon"; for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. This game is ported from an older arcade version.

Tombs &amp; Treasure is predominantly about solving puzzles and interacting objects with one another as they are found throughout the Mayan city. When travelling from temple to temple, the only available action is to walk using the D-pad. However, once a temple is entered, the player may start exploring much more thoroughly. Using a list of picture-based action keys ("Go", "Push", "Wash", etc.), the characters can interact with the environment, inspecting it for clues and manipulating it to unlock another area elsewhere.

There are several items to collect, as well, whose purpose can be learned by looking at them. Interestingly, the game gives each of the three characters -- the boy, the girl, and Jos? -- their own special attributes to let them all contribute to the quest. The boy is the player's in-game avatar and usually does the most hands-on work; the girl is talented musically; and Jos? is very strong and able to move things the other two cannot. However, some light turn-based combat also faces the player when a demon is encountered inside a ruin. These encounters almost always happen in the very first room of a ruin, although there are some exceptions.

Fighting is accomplished, simply enough, using the "Fight" command, although it should be noted that doing this means the player is using his bare hands. Equipping the sword is done before each fight by selecting "Use", and then highlighting the sword in the inventory, first. Battles are strictly turn-based, with no means of healing, and are simply bashing away at the monster until one or the other is dead. However, it is possible to run away from the fight with the "Go" command, with the player being fully healed when he comes back to try the battle again later.

    <desc>Rom hacks are always made with villainy on the mind. True, most rom hackers seek nothing more than to profane and disrupt, but there also exists a small collection of hackers that actually want to do... something with the original game. Some feel that the original Castlevania wasn't hard enough, and so they edit the levels to make it more challenging. Others will take characters and storylines (rarely both, but there are a few non-slacker hackers) and put them in a completely different game to create a pseudo-sequel.

These are all best case scenarios, however. In fact, I have recently discovered a middle ground between rom hack heaven and hell, a sort of rom hack limbo, where the author attempts to bring foreign characters into a different game, but ultimate creates only evil in the process. It is in this nightmarish place that I have glimpsed a hack of Mega Man 3 entitled "Tom Servo."

Now, of course, I don't need to tell you who Tom Servo is, or why anyone would want him in a game, but I will anyway for those of you who don't know, but are pretending that you do to avoid looking foolish in front of your friends: Tom Servo was one of the robots from the legendary TV experience known as Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K). Known for his gumball machine-like appearance and extensive underwear collection, it is only fitting that someone make a game with him as the main character, or rather, remake a game with him as the main character.

Toobin' involves Biff and Jet racing their way down the rapids of a river, riding on tires. You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus.

Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.

So you think you're hot stuff because you single-handedly won the war for us in the Persian Gulf? Well, that's going to feel like it was child's play after you get a look at your next mission.

In TOP GUN: The Second Mission, you'll be going up against a ruthless legion of planes, tanks, ships, and satellites that'll be firing missiles, cannon bursts, and anti-aircraft fire that have your name written all over them! You'd better master those Low-G YoYos, Immelman Turns, and Split-S Turns if you hope to survive out there. If you're not ready to take on an entire army by yourself, go head-to-head with a friend in some hardcore dogfighting action. Either way, you'll need to keep your cool if you're going to survive remember, this is not and exercise!

You are Quaid. Just a regular guy with a day job - who'd like to visit Mars. Then you see this commercial:

"..buy the -memory- of your ideal vacation - cheaper, safer, better than the real thing. Just call Rekall."

So you do.

"Let me tantalize you," says the Rekall salesman. "You're an undercover agent, people are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful woman. And by the time it's all over, you've got the girl, killed the bad guys, and saved the planet."

You smile reluctantly.

"OK," you agree. "Give me the memory implant."

Who are you anyway?

You're Douglas Quaid, right? A guy who does heavy construction downtown... Or are you?

You go to get this brain implant, one that leaves you with memories of a Martian vacation. But when they tap into your grey matter to prime you for the implant, they hit a memory cap...

Someone wanted you to forget who you were, where you've been, what you've done...

You work your way back home - fending off thugs with your bare hands - only to find your wife isn't really your wife. And your marriage is merely another memory implant. Plus, hired guns are after you. You gotta split.

So you end up in an abandoned cement factory. Weird place. Keep your guard up there.

And, oh yeah, there's one guy you never want to even get close to. Richter. Avoid him at all costs.

Things get really hectic when you're on the run. So you gotta keep your strength up. Pop energy canisters whenever you can get your hands on 'em. And stay away from dark alleys.

If you stay cool, you'll get an offer for a free ride to Mars. Take it. It's the only way you're ever going to find out what's really going on here.

Mars is a strange place. It's like the Wild West of The Future. They're mining some kind of super-valuable stuff called turbinium ore. And everyone wants a piece of the action. But a power-hungry guy named Cohaagen is trying to run off with the whole enchilada. Why doesn't anyone stop him? Could it be that this was -your- job?

Somewhere in this fiery red planet lies the answer to the two most important questions of your life: who are you? and who is it that doesn't want that question answered?

The object of the game is to destroy incoming bombs, asteroids, etc. without destroying friendly vessels. Due to the very quick speeds of the enemy ships and asteroids, the game is considered to be one of the most challenging Zapper games for the NES. The player must retrieve vials of medicine and deliver them to the Earth to win.

Game bosses are fought at the end of each level as the player moves through the Solar system. When the player reaches the Earth level, the player must keep the final boss, an alien named Nemesis, from reaching the planet's atmosphere.

Touchdown Fever is an arcade football game from SNK. Go head-to-head against the computer or a human opponent, or team up with another human player vs. the computer. Choose five, ten, or fifteen minute quarters for either league match (single game) or tournament play.

There are 12 teams from NFL cities to play with (six East, six West), although there is no NFL license and no real NFL players. Offensive plays can be run from five basic formations: long pass, short pass, quarterback sneak, running backs, and field goal kick/punt. There are no formations or plays on defense, but there are two possible players (A or B button) to take control of before the snap. The player perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling. Standard football scoring rules: most points after four quarters wins!

Track &amp; Field II is the sequel to Track &amp; Field created by Konami for the NES in 1988. It still continues the Olympic-themed sports events, but adds more realism by choosing a country for the player to represent. The series boasted 15 sporting events, with two of them available as bonus stages between rounds of the "Olympic" mode. It is based on the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, hence the introduction of Taekwondo (a Korean martial art) as one of the events.

Track &amp; Field helped to popularize the button-mashing style of gameplay, in which a player must hit a button on their controller as fast and as many times as possible in order to make their in-game athlete move quicker. This design rapidly incorporated into clones like Epyx's Summer Games. Many contemporary athletics games still use this form of control as a part of their gameplay.

    <desc>If you're thinking about playing this game, don't. I usually try not to say anything terribly bad about non-DBZ games on the site, because the people who translated it (usually) put a lot of effort into it. However, this game is just bad.

You are a large, 8pixel x 16 pixel red, white, and blue blob that can be Optimus Prime, or Inferno. I'm not really sure. And there's lot's of stuff zipping around the screen, and it all shoots at you, and it all can kill you in one hit. You hear the same song through the whole game. Many of the levels are palette swaps of the previous level. THREE of the bosses you'll fight are nothing more than a giant Decepticon symbol. (Yes, kids. Before there were Predicons, there were Decepticons. And they'd kick the Predicons' asses in). But the best part is, if you're patient enough to play this game for more than five minutes, there's some kind of an infinite loop in Stage 9. You get to the end ... and instead of fighting a boss (which is probably just another giant Decepticon symbol), you get whisked back to the beginning of the stage. Kinda remniscient of many old Atari games that never end. Anyway, play this horrible, horrible game at your own risk.

Translation Description:

This is an unofficial, independent addendum patch for the Transformers - Mystery of Comvoy version 1.00 translation done by No Talent Translations in 2000.

This patch corrects some emulator related issues. It does not alter the translation in any way.

After the game's release in late 1991, players had until noon EST on April 11, 1992 to practice beating the game. At this time, MTV revealed a secret password. By entering in this password and the game's serial number before beginning the game, players unlocked a secret "Prize World". After this, players had until midnight to complete the entire game including the Prize World. This prompted the game to reveal a 24 character code. By calling in to a special hotline with this code, players had a chance at winning one of 36,252 prizes.

When Samantha and Norbert were baby Trolls their Grampa told them tales of lost treasures stashed on a mysterious far away island. That was long ago. Yesterday, while wind surfing, our teenage troll twins came upon an undiscovered and uncharted island filled with excitement, adventure and hidden treasure. Exploring the island they soon realized it was the same island their Grampa told them about when they were young.

The twins passed through vine covered trees filled with multi-colored birds of every description. They were overwhelmed with the beauty of the island but they couldn't help thinking about the warning Grampa always told them: "If you ever come upon this magical island like I did when I was young - explore it with great care. there are many strange and dangerous creatures that make the island their home. Venemous snakes, giant flying insects, and huge slobbering jaws just to name a few. REMEMBER, ALWAYS BE CAREFUL!

Translation Description:

I don't know if this is complete or not, thanks to Neo Demiforce's lovely new layout, so I'll leave this here until proven otherwise. Anyway, this patch was dedicated to Sardu and Bloodlust Software, since version 0.42 of NESticle was able to play the game flawlessly (and also turned out to be the last release). From the start it's obvious that Demi translated it, since you'll see various things like "k" and "oh!" as you're flying around. That kinda stuff was really cool in Konami World, but it just seems out of place here. Oh well, enough bitching. Have fun with the game, and somebody let me know if it's finished or not.

Twin Eagle is a vertically scrolling arcade style shooter. You control a helicopter, and need to earn points by shooting or bombing the various (and numerous!) enemies you'll encounter. Planes, helicopters, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, foot soldiers, and more will all be trying to bring your mission to an abrupt end! Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points.

Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).

The story of Exodus centers on a quest (back in Sosaria) to destroy the final remnant of the evil Mondain and Minax. Exodus features revolutionary graphics for its time, being the first computer RPG to feature animated characters. Also, Exodus differs from previous games in that players now direct the actions of a party of several characters rather than just one.

Players now battle groups of enemies on a separate battle screen, where the player has to understand fairly complex weapons and magic systems and employ rudimentary tactics in order to overcome each opponent, as opposed to the system in the previous two games, in which the player is simply depicted as trading blows with one opponent on the main map until either is defeated.

Instead of the statistics-oriented character creation process typical of early computer role-playing games, in Ultima 4, players choose their character type by answering a series of ethical dilemmas. These situations have no easy resolution; players must rank the eight virtues and whichever stands as their highest priority determines the type of character they will play. For example, choosing Compassion makes you a Bard; Honor a Paladin, Sacrifice a Tinker, and so on.

While most wars throughout history were won and lost on the ground or at sea, we've entered a new era of fighting where most of the action takes place in the air. In ULTIMATE AIR COMBAT, you're the best fighter pilot in the world, and your country needs you to bring your skills to the front and help end an ongoing conflict.

You can choose between the F-14 Tomcat, the F-18 Hornet, and the Harrier II as you embark on a 36-mission campaign to take out an evil dictator and his renegade army. You can customize the arsenal on your plane by choosing from 20 devastating weapons you'll use in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. The 360-degree action will have your head spinning, but you'd better keep your cool if you're going to go home a hero!

The game plays like a conventional sports video game. The player choses from a list of eight available Teams, and controls five players on the team on the court, though only one player may be directly controlled at a time. There is a championship mode and a single game mode in the game. The game is unlike later sports based video games in that doesn't use real professional or college basketball players. The players a player may select for his team are entirely fictional, as are their statistics.

With your first mate steering the ship, you'll make your way to distant lands on a series of complex missions and breathtaking adventures. Stubborn merchants will sell you rare spices and valuable gems, which you can then sell to turn a profit.

Use your money to upgrade your fleet, or buy supplies to help you in your struggles against pirates, storms, and more. You'll have an armada of historically accurate sailing vessels as you try to reach famous 16th Century ports. If you can win a few new allies for Portugal, the King will reward you handsomely. Anchors aweigh and port ho!

The tires screeched loudly as you slammed on the brakes, swerving to avoid the shadowy figure in your headlights. Your sister screamed as your car careened off the road towards a tree. Then everything went black.

You awaken at the wheel of your crumpled car and realize that you are alone. Your sister must have gone for help. The aroma of gasoline assaults your nose, urging you to get out of the car as quickly as possible. As you exit the car, it bursts into flames. Before you looms a creepy old mansion. Could your sister have gone there for help? Are you to become the next uninvited guest?

--From the NES Uninvited instruction manual.

Overview:

You find yourself an Uninvited and unwilling guest in a house of horrors. Roam the mysterious mansion to find your missing sister. Search through various rooms, examine objects, pick up different items and use them to fulfill your quest.

Directions:

In the tradition of games like King's Quest and Quest for Glory, Uninvited is a first-person adventure/puzzle. The interface is a bit cumbersome in that you can't just type in "get the bottle" or "use the key" like you would on most computer games, it's all menus and pointers.

Still, it doesn't take any of the fun out, and it's not like you need lightning responses on a game like this. The challenge and the thrill is in finding the pieces of the puzzle and putting them all together.

I should mention that there is no RPG aspect and no fighting in Uninvited. Everything here can kill you easily, so the outcome of each encounter depends solely on whether you do the right thing. Save often, because there are many ways to die, and you're going to bump into most of them. 

Controls:

A Button: Select a Command, Scroll through messages
B Button: Cancel Selection
Start Button: Start Game
Select Button: Change windows

Hints:

Save...
Often. Worth mentioning again.

Keep Moving
You can't always solve every puzzle as soon as you come to it. Keep looking around to find more information or different items which may be useful. If you get stuck you might resort to the "do everything to everything" approach, but at least try to exercise some logic and patience first.

The purpose of the game is to knock the other player into a sewer manhole.There is a time limit, and the player has a set limit of stamina, both of which are represented by numbers. The player has two types of attacks: a light punch and a heavy punch. The light punch doesn't push your opponent as far as the heavy punch, but it is harder to block. The heavy punch sends your opponent reeling backwards, but can be blocked easily and takes a bit longer to pull off.

For every punch you throw, you lose 1 stamina. Flower pots are occasionally dropped from windows, which, if one hits a person, they will be dazed and will lose 5 stamina. In addition, a police car will pass by the fighting every 30 seconds which causes the players to return to their starting positions.

    <desc>This is an alternative patch to the standard translation. What's different, you may ask?

For one, you always have a map, and the maps have things such as the exits marked for you.

Also, both Up and Down exits alert you to their presence: This was one of the most aggravating things about the original game.

And finally, you take half damage; this makes things a lot more fair.

So basically, this is a big step towards what the game should've been like in the first place.

    <desc>Translation Description:

One of the lesser known entries in the Valis series is the NES title, which chucks the standard platformer formula of most of the games in favor of a Metroid-like format.

However, the game is *hard*, and mainly because the game has some critical design flaws.. I swear, the single credited game tester must have been high to not complain about these things.

    <desc>Okay, this game blows. I know that a lot of people spent a lot of time on this game (well not really), and I know that I should be nice and all (NOT really), but the game still blows. Think Hydlide with a sword. And better music. Okay, well it doesn't blow THAT much. You just walk around and kill stuff, and there's no point to any of it, and it's all just so bleh. It's got a day/night cycle, which is sweet, but there's no point to it, and it just goes back to day so quickly anyway, so it just ends up pissing you off. You might gain levels and stuff, and that character creation stuff in the beginning just MAY have some relevance to the rest of the game, but after about five minutes, you won't really give a damn, and you'll go back to playing your stupid Madden games.

Translation Description:

DvD was trying to play through the game, but all the issues with the current translation detracted from the experience. Since the game had very little text to deal with, he decided this well known classic Namco Action RPG really needed someone to give it a more accurate translation.

Our translation features:

- Title screen with translated title and subtitle

- Translated configuration and password entry screens

- In game "Danger" sign and start button popup translated

- "Ride the Ship" hint and "Exit" Inn/Shop signs in the ROM, but not in the game, were translated and put back in the game where they belong

- Cleaned up Engrish ending text

- "v" marks added to password on Inn screen to match those already on the password entry screen

Venice Beach Volleyball is no doubt the coolest video game under the hot summer sun. Check it out! We took miles of clear blue sky, warm sand, along with millions of gnarly 8-foot waves, mixed in dudes, babes, and one ton of pure fun, then crammed the whole thing with the maximum amount of challenge and excitement allowable by federal law. Here you have it, the most excellent beach volleyball game ever! Locals say kicking the butt of a computer-controlled team is never easy without a lot of practice. You haven't seen anything until you challenge a friend head to head in competitive double player action mode. Way rad beach volleyball action, blazing 8-bit graphics and killer tunes. That's what VENICE BEACH VOLLEYBALL is all about!

Controls:

D-Pad: Moves your character around.
A: Hits the ball.
B: Jump (used to spike the ball.)
Start: Pause Game.
Select: No Use.

Hints: 

Always try to spike the ball as any times as possible. Just set up a great spike and jump to time your shot right. Just spike as much as possible and try not to knock it out of bounds. If you spike the ball right every time, then it will be very easy to win. 

If they spike, you will have to predict where the ball will go. Try to predict where the ball will go right when you see them jump. You will have to get there quick and you may have to dive sometimes so be ready. 

If you ever have to dive to keep the ball alive, just toss the ball to them. Don't try to spike it to their side or anything because you will probably just mess up and the only person who could save you will be on the ground.

A small band of alien survivors landed on Earth several centuries ago. In order to survive in this new environment, they produced a neon green gel, which provided nourishment.

In an effort to blend into human society, they developed clones. As centuries passed, BEDA Corporation came into being. This was a company, which manufactured and distributed electronic and technological equipment; however, behind all this the company was also responsible for the maintenance of the alien race.

The neon gel had a very different effect on humans. It became a substance that was sought after by some of the world's wealthiest abusers. The gel is mass-produced by BEDA Corporation for profit, but the side effects proved to be lethal for human users.

Vice officer Quinn Hart, along with his partner Detective Reese, set out on assignment to locate the manufacturers of the mysterious gel. During the investigation, Reese disappears. Since his body has never been found, he is believed dead.

Now, Hart must go alone to uncover the source of the gel and the force behind it. His skills, nerves and ultimately fate are at stake in this deadly plot for survival.

--From the NES Vice Project Doom instruction manual.

"The year is 2525 and the planet Earth is in peril. Its destruction is imminent unless you stop an attacking force of evil alien space stations. Riding inside Vindicators, the most powerful battle tanks ever created, you must infiltrate each station and destroy its control center. Roam every level of each station in search of fuel, battle stars (used to customize your tank) and keys (to leave a level and enter the next) - all the while repelling fierce courtier attacks by enemy tanks, turrets, mines and flying saucers."

"Vindicators" was a pretty big arcade hit. It was a lot of fun on the NES as well. I don't think the graphics were as good, but they never are. The controls were a little slow, but it is still fun to play. I think it's a lot more fun if you have a buddy to play with. Vindicators is a lot of fun so give it a try.

Directions:

Destroy your opponents by shooting them with the various weapons on your vehicle. 

Controls:

A Button: Special Weapon
B Button: Normal Weapon
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Switch between special weapons

Hints:

Save
Don't forget about the save states, use them often.

No other baseball game gets you closer to playing in the big time than R.B.I. Baseball. Because every one of the ten teams in R.B.I. Baseball contains the rosters and player stats officially licensed from the MLB Players Association. Like real baseball, these skills and stats affect the outcome of every play. Like a real manager, you'll need to make good use of this vital information - and wise strategy decisions - if you want a winning record. R.B.I. Baseball is so intensely realistic, we've added amusing animation and a touch of humor to keep the action light-hearted and fun. You can play against the computer in a nine game season or compete against a friend in your own best-of-seven series. Stop playing with no-names and step up to the plate with real superstars in R.B.I. Baseball!

Nintendo Vs. System:

The Nintendo Vs. System is a coin-operated video game platform designed for two-player competitive play using the VS. UniSystem or VS. DualSystem, arcade system boards based on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Many of these stand-up or sit-down arcade machines had two screens and controls joined at an angle. These games were arcade ports of home video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, thus they could be sold cheaply to arcades in the late 1980s.

Hardware:

The Vs. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Popeye, and Mario Bros. machines. Being as such, they require the same special monitor that these coin-ops used. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors. Commercially available converters allowed one to use any standard open frame monitor with the game.

Almost all the games on the Vs. System ran on identical hardware, with the notable exception that four special PPUs (video chips) were also made, each containing a different palette (each of which appears to arrange the colors completely randomly). Most boards could be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs, though the appropriate PPU would also have to be used - if not, the game would appear with incorrect colors. Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

There were some dedicated Vs. double cabinets produced which looked like two games butted together at an angle. A single motherboard powered both games on those models.

A steel sit down cabinet for the Dualsystem, nicknamed the "red tent" due to its upper portion's resemblance to a pup tent, allowed play for up to four players similtaneously. This cabinet used the same motherboard as the double cabinet referred to above.

Differences Between Vs. System and NES Versions:

Sometimes the games were different from their NES versions. For example, Vs. Super Mario Bros. is considerably more difficult than Super Mario Bros; some of these levels are in the Japanese Disk System version of Super Mario Bros. 2. The graphics were also different from their NES counterparts; for example, Vs. Duck Hunt had more details and animation sequences than its console counterpart. Vs. Duck Hunt also contained a bonus stage which was notable for allowing players to shoot the dog who would normally obtain the ducks if the player shot them, and who would also laugh at the player, should the player miss the ducks.

Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

A steel sit down cabinet for the Dualsystem, nicknamed the "red tent" due to its upper portion's resemblance to a pup tent, allowed play for up to four players similtaneously. This cabinet used the same motherboard as the double cabinet referred to above.

Differences Between Vs. System and NES Versions:

Sometimes the games were different from their NES versions. For example, Vs. Super Mario Bros. is considerably more difficult than Super Mario Bros; some of these levels are in the Japanese Disk System version of Super Mario Bros. 2. The graphics were also different from their NES counterparts; for example, Vs. Duck Hunt had more details and animation sequences than its console counterpart. Vs. Duck Hunt also contained a bonus stage which was notable for allowing players to shoot the dog who would normally obtain the ducks if the player shot them, and who would also laugh at the player, should the player miss the ducks.

If you think it's scary on the outside, wait'll you see the basement! You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats - creatures lurking around every corner. As you descend deeper and deeper, they get thicker and thicker. Better stick close to the cavern floor - it's your only chance of finding a weapon or two. You're gonna need 'em. Because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular. So keep your courage up and your stake sharp. And say your prayers!

Nintendo Vs. System:

The Nintendo Vs. System is a coin-operated video game platform designed for two-player competitive play using the VS. UniSystem or VS. DualSystem, arcade system boards based on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Many of these stand-up or sit-down arcade machines had two screens and controls joined at an angle. These games were arcade ports of home video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, thus they could be sold cheaply to arcades in the late 1980s.

Hardware:

The Vs. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Popeye, and Mario Bros. machines. Being as such, they require the same special monitor that these coin-ops used. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors. Commercially available converters allowed one to use any standard open frame monitor with the game.

Almost all the games on the Vs. System ran on identical hardware, with the notable exception that four special PPUs (video chips) were also made, each containing a different palette (each of which appears to arrange the colors completely randomly). Most boards could be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs, though the appropriate PPU would also have to be used - if not, the game would appear with incorrect colors. Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

The game is based on a movie from 1985. A group of youngsters organizes a gang called The Goonies. You control one of the gang members, and your goal is to rescue your buddies, at the same time trying to escape from a level, avoiding pesky monsters and vicious rivaling gangsters.

The gameplay is platform action. You run through platforms, killing regenerating enemies (such as mice) by kicking them, and neutralizing pistol-shooting gangsters who are there to kill you (and whom you can't kill permanently). You collect items such as bombs, with which you can blast doors open, release your friends, or find valuable items. You can also jump and duck. There is a time limit for each level.

Unlike the sequel, the NES version was never released outside of Japan.

You are the last hope of the gentle people of Gradius. You've just lifted off to confront the all-out attack of the amoeboid Bacterions. Your hyper-space fighter is armed with the greatest arsenal in the galaxy. Air-to-surface and double beam laser cannons for incredible firepower. Powerful force fields for protection. Time and space warps for fleeing the dimension. You'll need it all just to survive. Because at the heart of the Bacterion Empire lies the Xaerous Superfortress - the nerve center of the all-knowing, all-seeing Bacterion Bio-Computer. It's a duel to the death, while the entire galaxy watches, waits, and hopes!

Nintendo Vs. System:

The Nintendo Vs. System is a coin-operated video game platform designed for two-player competitive play using the VS. UniSystem or VS. DualSystem, arcade system boards based on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Many of these stand-up or sit-down arcade machines had two screens and controls joined at an angle. These games were arcade ports of home video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, thus they could be sold cheaply to arcades in the late 1980s.

Hardware:

The Vs. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Popeye, and Mario Bros. machines. Being as such, they require the same special monitor that these coin-ops used. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors. Commercially available converters allowed one to use any standard open frame monitor with the game.

Almost all the games on the Vs. System ran on identical hardware, with the notable exception that four special PPUs (video chips) were also made, each containing a different palette (each of which appears to arrange the colors completely randomly). Most boards could be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs, though the appropriate PPU would also have to be used - if not, the game would appear with incorrect colors. Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

There were some dedicated Vs. double cabinets produced which looked like two games butted together at an angle. A single motherboard powered both games on those models.

A steel sit down cabinet for the Dualsystem, nicknamed the "red tent" due to its upper portion's resemblance to a pup tent, allowed play for up to four players similtaneously. This cabinet used the same motherboard as the double cabinet referred to above.

Differences Between Vs. System and NES Versions:

Sometimes the games were different from their NES versions. For example, Vs. Super Mario Bros. is considerably more difficult than Super Mario Bros; some of these levels are in the Japanese Disk System version of Super Mario Bros. 2. The graphics were also different from their NES counterparts; for example, Vs. Duck Hunt had more details and animation sequences than its console counterpart. Vs. Duck Hunt also contained a bonus stage which was notable for allowing players to shoot the dog who would normally obtain the ducks if the player shot them, and who would also laugh at the player, should the player miss the ducks.

Differences Between Vs. System and NES Versions:

Sometimes the games were different from their NES versions. For example, Vs.

The graphics were also different from their NES counterparts; for example, Vs. Duck Hunt had more details and animation sequences than its console counterpart. Vs. Duck Hunt also contained a bonus stage which was notable for allowing players to shoot the dog who would normally obtain the ducks if the player shot them, and who would also laugh at the player, should the player miss the ducks.

Nintendo Vs. System:

The Nintendo Vs. System is a coin-operated video game platform designed for two-player competitive play using the VS. UniSystem or VS. DualSystem, arcade system boards based on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Many of these stand-up or sit-down arcade machines had two screens and controls joined at an angle. These games were arcade ports of home video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, thus they could be sold cheaply to arcades in the late 1980s.

Hardware:

The Vs. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Popeye, and Mario Bros. machines. Being as such, they require the same special monitor that these coin-ops used. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors. Commercially available converters allowed one to use any standard open frame monitor with the game.

Almost all the games on the Vs. System ran on identical hardware, with the notable exception that four special PPUs (video chips) were also made, each containing a different palette (each of which appears to arrange the colors completely randomly). Most boards could be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs, though the appropriate PPU would also have to be used - if not, the game would appear with incorrect colors. Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

The odds are definitely against them. The enemy's coming by land, by sea, and by air, with an arsenal of every deadly weapon known to man. Tanks. Machine guns. Battleships. And the most villainous army of soldiers this peaceful little land has ever seen. And the defense? Just two lonely skykids in thinly armed, single engine prop bi-planes. They've got guts, but they'll need help from Above to win this battle - a steady hand, lightning reflexes, nerves of steel, and a heart of gold. Do you have what it takes? Then fasten your seat belt and take a deep breath. Because you are their only hope, SkyKid!

Star Luster has you piloting a fighter craft from a first person view, and warping around sectors in space through a stellar grid to destroy enemies before they move in and destroy your bases. All the while, your ship can be crippled through destructive enemy shots, and must be repaired by docking at the base for supplies. Star Luster broke the Star Raiders mold by incorporating an adventure mode that provided the player with a greater goal than the complete extermination of every enemy in space.

Star Luster was only released in Japan, but it is easily accessible by English speakers since none of the game's messages are written in Japanese, only English. But like many other Japanese games developed around this time, it can be mercilessly difficult. It incorporates a few enemy designs that originated from Bosconian. Star Luster saw some life after the Famicom. Nintendo adapted the title for play in the arcade as part of their Vs. Arcade system, calling it Vs. Star Luster.

Super Mario Bros., which stars Nintendo's classic mascot hero Mario in 30-some levels of inspired 2D platforming, introduced millions of players to videogames and left them captivated. Super Mario Bros. remains one of the most pioneering and influential titles to date. More importantly, it's every bit as addictive, enjoyable, and satisfying today as it was two decades ago.

Nintendo Vs. System:

The Nintendo Vs. System is a coin-operated video game platform designed for two-player competitive play using the VS. UniSystem or VS. DualSystem, arcade system boards based on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Many of these stand-up or sit-down arcade machines had two screens and controls joined at an angle. These games were arcade ports of home video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, thus they could be sold cheaply to arcades in the late 1980s.

Hardware:

The Vs. System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Popeye, and Mario Bros. machines. Being as such, they require the same special monitor that these coin-ops used. These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors. Commercially available converters allowed one to use any standard open frame monitor with the game.

Almost all the games on the Vs. System ran on identical hardware, with the notable exception that four special PPUs (video chips) were also made, each containing a different palette (each of which appears to arrange the colors completely randomly). Most boards could be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs, though the appropriate PPU would also have to be used - if not, the game would appear with incorrect colors. Several of the later Vs. games employed further measures of protection by using special PPUs which swapped pairs of I/O registers and/or returned special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory - attempts to run these games in other Vs. systems would result in the game failing to even start.

There were some dedicated Vs. double cabinets produced which looked like two games butted together at an angle. A single motherboard powered both games on those models.

A steel sit down cabinet for the Dualsystem, nicknamed the "red tent" due to its upper portion's resemblance to a pup tent, allowed play for up to four players similtaneously. This cabinet used the same motherboard as the double cabinet referred to above.

Differences Between Vs. System and NES Versions:

Sometimes the games were different from their NES versions. For example, Vs. Super Mario Bros. is considerably more difficult than Super Mario Bros; some of these levels are in the Japanese Disk System version of Super Mario Bros. 2. The graphics were also different from their NES counterparts; for example, Vs. Duck Hunt had more details and animation sequences than its console counterpart. Vs. Duck Hunt also contained a bonus stage which was notable for allowing players to shoot the dog who would normally obtain the ducks if the player shot them, and who would also laugh at the player, should the player miss the ducks.

Super Xevious is a 2D shoot 'm up by Namco and is part of the Xevious series. Xevious is known as one of the hardest and fastest shooters around and Super Xevious is even harder and faster!

The enemies of the first Xevious game are back! But this time they are not alone. No, the brought some nasty friends with them! It is your job, as a fighter pilot, to blast them away! Destroy everything in sight!

Some ground structures that must be destroyed are hidden and are called Sol Citadels. To locate these hidden structures you must keep an eye on the target-sight that will flash when it goes over the structures.

Super Xevious takes all the great elements of the original Xevious and has also some improvements. Some examples of improvements are, for instance, the shield option and the upgrade option. The shield protects you from immediately death if you got hit during an attack. The upgrade option gives you the possibility to upgrade your bombs, lasers and shields.

It's challenging and the pace is demanding. But satisfaction comes as you position each block neatly into place. Start at new heights for a tougher contest. Pick the music and set your pace from 20 progressive skill levels.

The sun shimmers on the horizon as your armed-to-the-teeth Navy fighter screams from the carrier deck, accelerating into the danger zone. High above hostile waters your mission is to defend the task force from enemy attack. Suddenly, bogeys flash onto your radar. They're everywhere, diving toward you at Mach 2. Only a second to react, you go to guns and arm missiles. Your heart pounds and palms sweat as you blast into the dogfight with cannons blazing. Tracers zip past your engines. Shells shatter your senses. Now it's just you against them. And to survive you'll need more than speed and firepower. You'll need guts and instinct. You'll need to be a "TOP GUN" pilot!

Warning: Wacky Race is a platformer, not a racing game!

The player controls Muttley through three different areas (Hip Hop, Splish Splash and Go Go America) in typical platform action. By collecting 100 diamonds, Muttley gains an extra life and by finding a bone, Muttley can switch out another one of his weapons, adding a slight strategy element to the game.

Controls:

Down - Crouch
Left - Move back 
Right - Move forward
A - Jump
B - Use weapon (if any)
SELECT - Pick option in menu bar
Start - Pause game (press again to resume)

Hints:

-Secret area in Hip Hop A-1
When you are in the castle and must drop down the hole to reach the next section, don't do so yet. Continue to the right instead and you'll find you can pass through the wall. You'll reach a new area, which contains 4 crystals, 2 bones and 1 life-up as well as an enemy.

-Easier boss fights
To make boss battles easier, try to encounter the bosses with the arrow in the menu bar on the third slot. There's always one bone when you fight against a boss. Now, you just need to take it and you can refill your health when you're low.

    <desc>Wagyan Land 2 plays pretty much identically to the first Wagyan Land. You're a cute green lizard dinosaur thing, and you walk to the right and shoot various syllables out of your mouth, which don't actually hurt enemies. They just remain frozen for a certain period of time, depending on how powered-up your attack is. Once you get four power-ups you become invincible, and you can finally kill the damned things. Which doesn't happen often.

So, how can you defeat the bosses with a crappy syllable that can't hurt anybody? Why you play minigames with them, of course! The whole game's pretty frustrating, with the whole "one-hit-and-you-start-the-entire-level-over" thing that's so popular in the world of videogaming. Honestly, it's fun and all, but I don't understand why the game needed to have two sequels.

Translation Description:

While this isn't iquite/i as polished as a href="http://www.spoony-bard.com/alanmidas/" target="_blank"Midas/a's translation of the first Wagyan Land game (the title screen, for instance, and the GYA syllables that he shoots out are left in Japanese), it's still all in English, and pretty fun to play. You can just pretend those projectiles are magical, uh, runes, or something.

    <desc>If you've played Kero Kero Keroppi's Great Big Adventure 2, you know exactly what to expect. You shoot things at enemies, and you play some kind of funky game with the boss, instead of actually fighting him. The word chain game is freaking DIFFICULT. Anyway, the most major change (not really a "change," since Wagyan Land came first) is that you can't jump on your enemies to kill them. You can't even kill them at all, unless you get four powerups and become invincible. Once you shoot an enemy, it's just FROZEN for a little while, and you can jump on it and stuff. It's pretty wicked. And of course, one hit kills you, just like in all great games. Too bad the collision detection totally bites. Oh yeah, and the graphics are awesome! They're just so simplified and elite and stuff. So yeah! Play the game.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated, yeah! Love this game.

    <desc>At first glance, it may look like a bugs bunny rip-off, but it is actually a bootleg game loosely based off a Russian cartoon called "Nu, pogodi!". The sprites, however, are based off loony toon characters.

The game sucks. For an attack, you do a spin thing, similar to the tazmanian devil. When you jump, the game slows down, making it frustrating every time you have to jump. Bad controls, and bad jump psychics make this game freaking hard to beat. Not only has no one heard of this pirated game, little have ever beaten it. This game is so bad, and so frustrating, that I was screaming my head off while playing this awful game.

Well in all honesty, it's a bunch of games just kinda smashed together. There's some Twinbee action going on, and a little Gradius, and a lot of side-scrolling stuff. Thankfully the crappy scrolling in the first Wai Wai World is done away with, and the game's a whole lot easier. It's still pretty unfair sometimes, like why some small little piddly-ass green thing does three hearts' worth of damage. It confuses me, which is why this game is cool. Kind of. Ummmm, yeah.

Translation Description:

All (most) of the instructions you need to play are in the readme, not like it's too difficult to figure out, but have fun! Version 1.01 fixes an untranslated graphic.

    <desc>Konami just kicks ass. Not only do they make some rockin games like Metal Gear, Castlevania, and Tokimeki Memorial (of course), but they even make some crazy stuff like this game. You take control of Konamiman, and you go around places and rescue characters from other Konami games, like Goemon and Simon Belmont and stuff, and then they become playable characters. Pretty freaky eh? Fortunately the game never takes itself seriously, which is definitely a good thing, since it's not all that great of a game. It's too hard! And what the HELL is up with the scrolling? It's not difficult kind of hard so much as it's an unfair kind of hard. Like, the scrolling. Or, little monsters jumping at you and hurting you when you first appear on screen, and even if you DID have time to react, you could do nothing to stop it. NOTHING. Why do people like this game? I mean sure, a bunch of Konami characters in one game is kinda neat, but the game is really bad! Just go and play their separate games, for God's sake.

Translation Description:

The one thing that really bugs me about this patch is that the whole reason for it is because Dylan thought that Demi's translation was inaccurate, and he decided to do something about it. Yet, Vic Viper and Twinbee have been changed to Dylan and Tina. Wha? Aside from that, and various abbreviations/spelling errors, everything is very well done, and much more verbose than the old Demiforce translation. A lot more things actually make sense, and stuff was added to explain things a little more. This doesn't make the game suck any less, but oh well. Anyway, all in all a great translation was made here. And give some respect to Tina, because the font owns you. Seriously.

Wall Street Kid is nearly as exciting as Wall Street. Probably because, Wall Street isn't all that exciting either. But, it does have some uniqueness to it and is the only game I know of its kind. If you love text then you'll love this game. Other than that it is rather bland!

Directions:

You are given $500,000 dollars and set loose on the stock market. Your goal is to gain enough funds to pay for a new home and to eventually have the family home and maintain its heritage. Along the way you need to spend money on other things such as cars, gifts for Pricilla, and other expenses that come your way. Get enough money to buy the family house and become a successful stockbroker!

Wally Bear is a member of the NO! Gang. This gang is no normal gang. It works like a youth support group. They help each other get through life's rough spots that deal with drugs/stealing/alcohol/peer pressure etc. You must navigate Wally from his home to his Uncle's house for a party. You will meet up with many friends along the way. This guide will chronicle the interactions between Wally and his friends throughout the journey.

Overview:

Wally Bear and the NO! Gang is an educational Nintendo Entertainment System game that teaches children to say no to potentially harmful drugs like tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. It is notable for being one of the many NES games that were not licensed by Nintendo, most likely because the game's content did not comply with Nintendo's Content Guidelines that were in power at the time of the game's release. The game was designed in cooperation with the American Medical Association and the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information. Like in most early platform games, even getting hit once meant losing a "chance" to beat the game.

The game was originally going to be called Wally Bear and the Just Say No Gang, but Nancy Reagan had trademarked this phrase. The Wally Bear Hotline provided by this game, 1-800-HI-WALLY, was still active as of 2006. However, it was finally disconnected by October 2007; 15 years after the game was released.

Toad, the player's avatar in the game, has to arrange monsters and bombs to stop Wario from taking control of the forest. The player controls a character that moves the already fallen objects. Toad can pick up individual objects or entire columns of objects and move them elsewhere. The object of the game is to clear the player's screen of objects, the objects of this game being the monsters. This is accomplished by arranging monsters and bombs of the same color in horizontal, diagonal or vertical rows of three or more blocks. Clearing four objects at once lowers your opponent's screen by one row in vs. mode, or gives you more time in single-player mode.

Trivia:

The NES version was later re-released for Wii's Virtual Console in 2006, and in Animal Crossing in 2002. Wario's Woods is a Tetris-derived falling block game, although in this case the blocks are actually forest-dwelling creatures and bombs. Due to the increasing popularity of the Super NES, Wario's Woods was the last licensed game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. [1] This game is the only game in which Toad has the starring role, although he has been available as a playable character in various games since Super Mario Bros. 2.

    <desc>
Ah, WCW. Created by Mr. "Controversy Creates Cash" Eric Bischoff. This was his business until 2001, when WWE, The WWF at the time, bought WCW out, and put Bischoff out of a job. But this game is 12 years before that happened and a few years before 'Monday Night Wars' (The Story of WCW Nitro and WWF Raw is War) and you can wrestle as some of the greatest wrestlers who ever lived, and some who still wrestle.

Wrestle as the Nature Boy Ric Flair, who put people and still puts people out of action with the Nature Boy Figure 4 Leglock. Wrestle as the famous Sting, who made many men give up when he locked them in his Scorpion Death Lock. Wrestle as the Road Warriors Animal and Hawk, who made their appearance as the mystery tag team in the 1998 Wrestlemania Battle Royal... and won. Or become Rick Steiner, one of the famous Steiner Brothers.

In my opinion, you'd have to have a lot of consistency to like this game. You're going to stink at first, but then eventually you'll have the eye of the tiger with your chosen wrestler, and dominate.

Directions:

Wrestle as your favorite WCW wrestler of 1989. 

Featured wrestlers:

-Ric Flair
-Sting
-Lex Luger
-Mike Rotunda
-Road Warrior Hawk
-Road Warrior Animal
-Steve Williams
-Kevin Sullivan
-Ricky Steamboat
-Ric Steiner
-Eddie Gilbert
-Michael P.S. Hayes

Controls:

A Button Punch
B Button Kick
Start Button Exit main menu

Hints:

-How to do your moves
Since you won't be able to do all your moves, you get to choose 4 moves that are assigned to your wrestler. Look on your control pad to determine which ones you want and what move you want assigned to each direction. 

-Secret Character
To unlock the secret character, known as the WCW Master, you must defeat all
of the other wrestlers in "One Player - Single" Mode.

He's BAD, RAD and extremely MAD - because to a WEREWOLF, there's nothing like revenge! The world's been destroyed by Dr. Faryan, a twisted madman possessed by an ancient spirit. Faryan's henchmen rule. But one buff warrior's been granted magical powers of the wolf and is now out to bust-up Faryan. And when WEREWOLF finds him, the fur and fangs will fly!

"I will destroy you, Faryan..."

But in order to get to Faryan, you've got to battle your way past his army of death slaves. Nothing in Faryan's New World can be taken for granted - evil lurks everywhere. There are five levels you must clear in order to reach Faryan. Easier said than done - each level is protected by one of Faryan's Level Bosses. And they get gnarlier as you go along. But you've been granted powers of the Great Spirit, War Wolf. You know what you must do. The time has come to live your vision. Destroy Faryan.

    <path/>
    <image/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Of all the Wheel of Fortune games on the NES, this one has to be the best. If you're trying to put together a good NES system with good games, controllers, and all the cool equipment, this game should be near the top of the list. Its music is an improvement (I think Rare had something to do with the music), the puzzles bigger, the prizes better, and you earn a lot more money. However, the graphics are no better and the game base is the same. It would have looked a lot like this if you were playing the original Wheel of Fortune. Overall, this game is a good one, and if you want a classic Wheel of Fortune game, I say give this one a try. The opening scene graphics are pretty cool too.

The exciting software version of television's number one game show has an all-new Family Edition! Now, everybody's favorite, Wheel of Fortune, has even more great fun: over 1000 challenging puzzles in both regular categories and new ones to give you even more great game play. You're the contestant competing against your friends or matching wits with the computer. You already know how to play... and it's your turn. Let the theme music inspire you and spin for a consonant or buy a vowel if you have the cash. If you're right, the pretty hostess will turn the letters. Do you want to take a shot at guessing the puzzle, or do you want to run up your score? Get set to spin, get set to win - the Wheel of Fortune Family Edition is hours of fun for the whole family!

Directions:

Spin a wheel and guess letters to solve a puzzle. There are things to stop you, such as Bankrupt and Lose a Turn. If you win the game, you get to choose a prize (however, in modern day Wheel of Fortune, you spin a smaller wheel, with a chance at 100,000 dollars, or some other nice rewards). After you choose, you have to pick 5 consonants and one vowel (I suggest you pick R,S,T,L,N,E, because those are the most common letters in a word, and in modern WOF, you get those letters automatically, then you get an extra 3 consonants and one vowel). Then it's up to you to solve the puzzle, with 40 seconds on the clock. Hit the "Play Now" button and get going.

Controls:

A Button Pick letters, Choose how hard to spin the wheel
B Button Same as A
Start Button Exit the main menu into Game Setup
Select Button Nothing

Gametek just took their first Wheel of Fortune creation and renamed it, and changed the prizes around. Barely anything is Junior about this game.

Directions:

Spin the wheel, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle. 

Controls:

A Button Choose letter, choose options
B Button Choose letters, Choose options
Start Button Go to game after menu

Hints:

The letters to pick in the last round
When you get to the bonus round, if you get there, always pick "R, S, T, L, N, E." These are the most common letters and they'll always give you a decent chance (this game was made before the rule where you automatically got those letters).

Spin the Wheel. Buy a Vowel. Solve the Puzzle. If you're not familiar with this concept then you've been asleep for the past 25 years.

Directions:

As a faithful reproduction of the idea of the TV Game Show, this is pretty good. But as a video game it's a bit, well, not so good. Graphically, it's behind the times even for when it was made. Vanna is a horrible monster in a horrible pink dress. The Wheel is round in the sense that it doesn't have corners, but it's pretty far off from circular. Don't bother playing against the computer. If you play on Easy your opponents are completely illiterate, if you play on Hard they already know all the answers, and if you play on Normal, well, it's purely a game of chance.

Controls:

Start Button Start Game
A or B Button Choose Letters, Spin, Vowel, Solve

Hints:

-Spin Strength
The strength of your spin doesn't affect the game in any discernible way except for the time it takes to stop. So to keep the game moving use low strength, because the high strength spin will keep that wheel moving for about an hour.

You are an agent of the ACME detective agency. Guess what? The world famous female criminal Carmen Sandiego and her henchmen are up to no good, stealing things from the past and moving through certain time periods to cover their tracks. So, as an agent of ACME, use your chrono-skimmer to go through those time periods to track those criminals, and eventually Carmen, down. But you only have a certain amount of time to do it! And can you?

Trust me, no true NES fan should have neglected this game. The graphics are perfect, the menu is creative (you can stop by the detective lounge for a coffee, or the lab to look at an experiment, or look at the credits in the basement) and the sounds just get an A+. You'll enjoy it because it also involves your brainpower. This is history class in your NES system. 

Directions:

It's a more complicated game, due to its historical time period theme. But once you've played it for 10 minutes, it easily sinks into you. There's 3 things to do - Travel, Search and gather your data. But search is the real moneymaker in the group. In search, you look for clues from witnesses, informants, and scanning the area for stuff. Identify is how you pinpoint the exact identity of your thief (he or she steals certain things, from Mickey mouse to ancient statues) and you can look up dossiers to find out the full description of the person you're after. Travel gets you using your chrono-skimmer to travel in time to where you need to go. And if you're on the right track, you'll see a short segment of "V.I.L.E henchman detected" and you'll know your person was there. Eventually, you track them down to the last moment, and then you have to rely on luck, because your person will set traps. There's 3 ways to catch the criminal - the witness option, the informant option, and the scanner option. Picking the right one will get you to the criminal. The other two will just slow you down and possibly get the crook slipping through your fingers. So grab your chrono-skimmer, get your cursor over the "play now" button, and start the game.

Storyline:

A MEMO FROM THE CHIEF

To: All Acme Offices
From: The Chief
Re: Sandiego, Carmen

As you all know, Carmen Sandiego is the ringleader of an international band of thieves who have been making life difficult for Acme and police forces throughout the world. They travel from one country to another as easily as you or I go to the supermarket. While we've been able to nab her precious mobs, no prison seems able to hold her.

I need you all to help Acme crack its toughest assignment yet...track Carmen through time! Carmen and her V.I.L.E. henchmen have gained the ability to travel through time. They've broken into a super-secret laboratory and made off with the latest model time machine. Not content with pillaging the present, they are using this technology to loot the most famous treasures of the past 1500 years: Napoleon's hat, Don Quixote's lance, and even Paul Revere's horse. (Fortunately they took Mr. Revere's horse on April 19, 1775, the day after his famous ride, so no damage was done.)

You will be issued the latest development in portable time travel devices; the Chrono-skimmer 325i. You will use it to travel 1500 years of time and 48 locations. You can electronically scan the crime scene for clues and translate conversations with witnesses. It also contains a Capture Robot to nab your suspect with a minimum of fuss.

Acme has been granted a Federal Time Travel Commission license allowing us to use the Chrono-skimmer with certain time limit restrictions. The attached information will assist you in your tasks.

Best of luck from all of us at Headquarters. We're counting on you!

    <marquee/>
    <desc>
Yes, it's true, the popular Where's Waldo (Where's Wally in England) books were made into a video game. Unfortunately however, because of the pixilated graphics of the NES, it's surprisingly difficult. The only way you can distinguish between people is their shirts; meaning heads, arms or any other limb looks the same on everyone. Although, sometimes hats can be seen, and usually that is how you will spot him. 

Directions:

The main theme of the game is easy enough to understand: if you see Waldo, just move your cursor over him and select that area. Selecting areas decreases time if you don't select the area where Waldo is, so don't go nuts with the A button.

You don't get a message if you've found Waldo, so listen out for the "Mission Accomplished" style music.

There are 4 modes to choose from: Practice, Easy, Medium &amp; Hard. The difficulty increases by giving you less time to find Waldo, and also the map space increases with difficulty. The practice mode, however, doesn't have a time limit, so you can take as long as you want searching for Waldo. There are 9 levels in total, varying from everyday places such as a train station, to the moon...

Most of the levels keep the same aspect of simply finding Waldo, but there are a odd few that are random mini games such as the revolving maze.

This game will give you a little burst of fun if you liked the books, and if you didn't then this may not be the game for you. Most people I know that have played this, played it once then got bored. 

Controls:

A Button Scan selected area for Waldo
D Pad Move cursor
Select Button Select difficulty
(In main menu)

Hints:

-Watch for the Hat
On the easier modes, keep an eye out for the trademark Waldo's hat (on the harder modes, he doesn't always wear it).

You've seen the movie. You know the story.

A heartbroken, Hollywood "Toon" star is accused of murdering one of the most popular men in town. The same man who was, just 24 hours earlier, seen playing "pattycake" with our star's lovely and mysterious wife. It's an open and shut case, right? WRONG!

This is where your job begins. You must search high and low through downtown Los Angeles, the City Park, the Warehouse District and even ToonTown looking for clues to help Eddie prove that Roger is innocent. You have to unearth all four pages of Marvin's missing Will that will guarantee ToonTown's future forever. At the same time, you must also keep the Weasels from getting Roger, protect Jessica from the dreaded Dipmobile and help Eddie stay out of jail. As if that's not enough, you must collect the right weapons, accessories and facts that will enable you to defeat Judge Doom in the final confrontation.

You'll have to call up all of your game playing and super-sleuth detective abilities to get you through this one... And there's still no guarantee. In the end, the joke could be on you.

--From the NES Who Framed Roger Rabbit? instruction manual.

Overview:

Based on the Disney movie, you are Eddie Valiant. With Roger Rabbit as your faithful companion, defeat Judge Doom and save Toon Town.

Directions:

This is actually a surprisingly fun and complex game. It is basically a quest game, meaning that your fundamental task is to go around talking to people and finding different items to proceed through the game. It also has some action and fighting aspects, too. As you explore L.A. and Toon Town watch out for the Weasels. Choose the correct Punch line to keep them laughing. Use various items to tempt the different characters into giving you information or other useful stuff. 

Controls:

A Button Talk, Search, Enter Code, Gas
B Button Attack, Use Item, Brake
Start Button Start, Pause
Select Button Choose Start or Enter Code, Hold while pressing Up or Down to select items, Enter the Cab

Whomp 'Em is the story of Soaring Eagle, a young Indian Brave who ventures into the world seeking totems for his magic pouch. Whomp 'Em consists of eight worlds. The first world acquaints you with the game. The next six worlds may be traveled in any order. The final world is a secret!

--From the NES Whomp'Em instruction manual.

Whomp 'Em is an action platformer, akin to many games at the time. It is notable for being one of the few video games to feature a Native American as the protagonist. After completing the first stage, the player can play the other six in any order. Each of the stages revolve around elements, such as fire and water. After each stage, the player gains a new weapon, much like in the original Mega Man series, which was extremely popular at the time.

Both Whomp 'Em and its prequel (which was an adaptation of Wonder Boy in Monster Land), are based on the Journey to the West novel.

The title, "Whomp 'Em" is a pun, based on wampum, white beads used by Native American tribes primarily for trading.

Controls:

Directional Pad - Controls Soaring Eagle's movements
START - Press to select a Totem to use
SELECT - Pauses/resumes the game, shows how many more Gourds before you get an extra Heart
A Button - Jump
B Button - Strikes with Soaring Eagle's spear or Totem

Hints:

-Access Sound Test
At the title screen, hold down A + B on Controller #2 and press Start on Controller #1. Continue holding A + Buntil the message ''BGM + SE 00'' pops up on the screen.

-Extra Energy
When you begin the game, die quickly and continue. You'll continue with two energy bottles. Repeat the process to begin with three energy bottles(the maximum).

Widget must stop his evil twin from destroying the planet Earth. Widget was sent to Earth and uses his changing powers to fight enemies.

Overview:

Widget is a platformer, much like Mega Man where you play as an alien who shoots pellets out of a gun. Also like Mega Man, the player can choose which level to play first, after beating the first level, and gains a new weapon (in this case new creatures he can change into) each time he beats a boss.

It is based on the cartoon series Widget the World Watcher, staring a purple alien named Widget who has the unique ability to transform into other versions of himself, including a golem, a cannon, a bird and a speedy mouse. It also had a sequel by the name of Super Widget on the Super NES.

Put yourself in the middle of a western showdown. Armed with the Zapper, it takes a quick hand and deadeye to earn your reward. Draw against the most wanted outlaws in the West. Then, if you're brave enough, take on the whole gang at once!

--From the NES Wild Gunman instruction manual.

History:

The original version was one of Nintendo's early electro-mechanical arcade games released in 1974. It consisted of a light gun connected to a 16mm projection screen. An image of a Wild West gunslinger was projected onto the screen and when his eyes flashed, the player needed to draw and shoot. If the player was fast enough the projection would change to that of the shot gunman falling down, otherwise it would show the gunman drawing and firing his gun. A piece of Chopin's "Funeral March" indicates the player's defeat.

The second version had a plastic gunman figure mounted on top of a plastic battery box called Custom Gunman, which later became one of the microgames in the Nintendo Game Boy Advance title, WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!.

Other releases:

An updated video game version of the game was released in the arcades in 1984, replacing photographic images with cartoon-style video game sprites. In this version the player also waited for the opponent's eyes to flash (accompanied by a speech bubble reading "FIRE!!") before shooting. This was the first NES game that used voice synthesis.[citation needed] It also featured a shooting gallery where opponents had to be shot from the windows of a saloon. It was available on the PlayChoice 10 system, and also as a two-player Vs. Series version. The Famicom version for use with the Zapper peripheral was released in Japan the same year, and in the US on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The Famicom version was also available packaged with a plastic, western-style revolver accessory that could be used instead of the Zapper.

A very limited edition of the game was created for promotional purposes and distributed at the 1986 National NRA Annual Meeting. This version of the game is very similar to the original with the primary difference being that some targets are labeled 'anti-gun advocate' and 'ATF thug'.

The NES port of the game will be available for Nintendo's Wii console by way of the Virtual Console.

It is a time of great turmoil to the world. Bavmorda, a former messenger from the Spirit of the Skies, has turned towards evil. Her plan is to rule the world through her twisted magic. Her force is incredible and her armies are unstoppable. She even dared to transform Fin Raziel, the messenger from the Spirit of the Earth, into a small animal. Bavmorda believes that there is no one that can stop her.

But she had not heard of the tribe of the Nelwyns. There had been a prophecy among these people that one of their tribe would help lead the world out of its darkest hour. The High Aldwyn, the wizard of the Nelwyn tribe, recognized Willow Ufgood as the chosen one. The adventure begins for Willow as he leaves his family and friends and sets out to stop all of the evil that Bavmorda has created.

--From the NES Willow instruction manual.

Directions:

Defeat Bavmorda and her minions with your sword and magic. Your sword (once obtained) can be used in two different ways. Jab and Swipe. To Jab, move while pressing B. To Swipe, stand still and press B.
You can also cast magic (once obtained) with A.

    <desc>This is a board game that stars five Mega Man characters: Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, Dr. Cossack, Roll, and Kalinka, Dr. Cossack's daughter. From what I understand, up to four players can choose one of those characters and play a board game, which seems similar in setup to Monopoly. It also appears to have some mini-games, but I couldn't find any.

The object of the game (and again, I'm guessing) is to go around the board enough times and collect a certain amount of cash, so you can win the game. Along the way you'll get items, and get your character replaced by one of the Mega Man boss characters. Seems fun, but having everything in Japanese kinda spoils it.

Translation Description:

All in-game text has been replaced, along with the appropriate graphics. This makes the game fully playable in English.

This is the Patch with North American names instead of Japanese names.

Based on the popular game show and party game. Guess the clues based on the pictures drawn by the other team (or let the computer do the drawing).

Directions:

This is probably the worst concept I've ever seen for porting a party game or game show to a console video game. The medium just doesn't lend itself to what Win Lose or Draw is all about. First off it's pretty hard to draw anything recognizable with a Nintendo controller and a time limit. At least it's not an Etch-A-Sketch; you can push A to move the pointer without drawing, so you don't have to try to retrace yourself if you need to start a new line. But the game structure is pretty bizarre even if you ignore the implementation of the drawing component. I think in the party game the drawing guy is on the same team as the guessers. Otherwise you'll need a referee to prevent people from drawing the wrong thing just to intentionally confuse the other team, right? How am I supposed to guess 'cat' when you've clearly drawn a car? Oh, right, you're not on my team, why should you try to help me get the right answer? One answer to this is to let the computer do all the drawing for you. Also, play is slightly more interesting on the harder difficulty levels, because the words are longer and not necessarily simple concepts like 'dog'. On the other hand, it's pretty frustrating to try to spell a long word with the poor interface in this game.

As for graphics and sound, you can guess there isn't much to this version of Win Lose or Draw. The human figures are recognizable, and I guess those are meant to be couches they're sitting on. The music is a very annoying and very short song that repeats infinitely until you are driven screaming mad from the room. There are a grand total of three sound effects, and none of them is any good. Presumably all the memory for this game was reserved for a vast library of secret words and clue pictures, so if you can stand to play at all you can at least hope not to see the same words every time. 

Controls:

A Button Change Options, Pick Letters, Toggle Pen
B Button Submit Answer, Erase Drawing
Start Button Start/Pause

Hints:

-B Ain't Backspace!
The most frustrating thing while playing this game is to realize you've put in the wrong letter. You'll want to press B to go back, right, since A is to enter the letter and go forward, right? But B is of course to submit your answer, and you lose points for putting in the wrong answer, so make sure you remember to go over to the little backspace arrow when you need to correct yourself.

It's all here - the strategy, the challenge, the competition and the pageantry of the Winter Games. Compete against a friend or take on the computer in four completely realistic and action-packed events. Choose the country you want to represent. Then practice, train and develop the winning strategy for each competition... Speed Skating in a grueling race on ice. Hot Dog Aerials for daredevils on skis. Figure Skating to test balance, stamina and precision. Bobsled, where every screaming turn could mean the difference between wiping out and winning gold. Your adrenaline and heart are racing. Let the games begin!

A snow-and-ice themed follow-up to the highly successful Summer Games, Winter Games was released in 1986 for the Commodore 64 and later ported to several popular home computers and video game consoles of the 1980s.

The game was presented as a virtual multi-sport carnival called the "Epyx Winter Games" (there was no official IOC licensing in place) with up to 8 players each choosing a country to represent, and then taking turns competing in various events to try for a medal.

    <desc>Did you ever watch Tron? Thought the Light Cycle scene was really cool? Well, this game is very similar to that, only with a few tweaks and one of the most abysmally bad storylines I've ever seen.

The gameplay itself isn't bad; it's actually pretty fun. Like in Tron, the goal is to get your opponent to cross either the line you leave behind when you move, or to cross over their own line. However, unlike those lame Light Cycles, you can actually jump over a line or two in this game, a maneuver that will save your ass quite frequently. The difficulty isn't too bad, since most of your opponents will fall for the same trick over and over again, but environmental effects like the ice level can throw you off badly, since you'll slide 3 or 4 lines over whenever you pull a corner.

Now, let me state that this game has one of the most retarded storylines I've ever seen in a game; a storyline so bad it makes the one from Blaster Master seem believable and brilliant. Any explanation I'll give won't come close to explaining it, so here it is:

"Joe was a teacher.."

"He saved a student."

"A car hit him!"

"Dr. Wit asked him to join his Joke Army and take over the world. Joe refused and became Naked Man!"

"Now save the world!!"

Oh god, where to begin.. First of all, seeing the pictures during this intro will help, I guess.. But I have to wonder; since when does getting mangled by a car suddenly make you a candidate for some evil genius's army? I guess that's why it's called the Joke Army; I know I'd think it was a joke if some guy in a full body cast came wheeling at me in a gurney groaning that he was here to kick my ass and take over the world.

But, Joe refuses, and becomes.. Naked Man? Way to go there, Dr. Wit; give the person who refuses to work for you Super Powers. Maybe he isn't so much a genius as he is evil. At least Naked Man's powers seem to suck really badly compared to most super heroes.

Oh, and most of the Joke Army lives up to its name, with one opponent who's apparently a relative of the Invisible Dick Licking Clown from Citizen X.

But, if you basically ignore the story Wit's is a pretty fun, albeit short game to kill some time with.

Translation Description:

Well, the translation is good, especially since there seemed to be some technical issues with hacking this game. The only japanese text was the intro, which you can read in the game review above.

A classic Dungeon-crawler. Fight your way to the bottom of the labyrinth to confront an evil wizard and recover the Overlord's lost Amulet.

Wizardry is one of the true classics. It comes from a time when RPG meant simply fighting your way through a maze, with some few puzzles and such along the way, but primarily focused on gaining levels through combat. The features we now think of, e.g. overland travel, NPC interaction, etc., were considered the realm of Adventure Gaming. So we have a very simple plot in which an evil wizard has stolen an incredibly powerful artifact and hidden with it in a huge labyrinth beneath the Overlord's city. Your job is to fight your way to the bottom level, destroy him and recover the stolen item. To do this you will create a party of up to six characters of different types (loosely based on D&amp;D rules) who will then fight, cast, and sneak their way through the maze, picking up treasure and experience along the way. Of course it seems quite simple by today's standards, but it is still an extremely fun game, and one of the must-plays if you are an RPG gamer.

Directions:

It is almost impossible to tell you everything you'll want to know to play this game, but here are a few vitals: Different Races have different starting stats, so choose appropriately based on the type of character you want.

The Classes are Fighter (Needs 11 Str), Mage (11 IQ), Cleric (11 Piety), and Thief (11 Agility). There are also Elite classes which you usually won't be able to choose until later in a character's career as his stats increase: Wizard, a sort of Cleric/Mage (12 IQ and 12 Piety); Samurai, a Fighter/Mage (15 Str, 11 IQ, 10 Piety, 14 Vitality, 10 Agility); Lord, a Fighter/Cleric (15 Str, 12 IQ, 12 Piety, 15 Vit, 14 Ag, 15 Luck); and Ninja, a super-Thief (needs 17 in all Stats). However, changing the class of an existing character will reduce his stats to his racial defaults.

Armor Class: similar to old D&amp;D rules, your base armor class is 10, and lower is better.

Spells
Unless you want to bully around the game with no casters, you'll need to know what the spells do, but there's no way within the game to find out, except trial and error. So here's a partial list to help you get started:
Priest Level 1
Dios - heals, Badios - harms enemy, Kalki - Improves Armor class of party, Milwa- causes a glowing light increasing vision and revealing secret doors, Porfic-improves caster's armor class by 4
Priest Level 2
Calfo-reveals trap on a chest, Manifo- causes monster paralysis temporarily, Matu- improves party members' armor class by 2,Montino-makes it impossible for monsters to cast spells
Mage Level 1
Dunapic-informs you of the party's exact position from the stairs to the castle, Halito-flame ball hits monster for 1-8 points damage, Katino-causes most of the monsters in a group to fall asleep, Mogref-improves caster's armor class by 2
Mage Level 2
Dilto- reduces monster's ability to defend against your attacks; Sopic- causes the caster to become transparent thus improving armor class by 4 

Controls:

A Button Enter Selection
B Button Cancel Selection, Go Back
Start Button Start Game
Select Button Toggle Caps and Lower Case in Name Screen

Hints:

-New Characters
Make lots of 'em. The random Bonus Points you start out with are crucial to getting the character classes you want. Wait for at least 15 for a good character. What do you do with the ones you don't want? Add them to your party, pool all their money to one character, and then delete the rest. When you're finally ready your party will start with heaps of money for equipment.

The game functions virtually identically to the first scenario, Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, with the player guiding a party of up to six adventurers into a 6 level dungeon. The original version required players to import characters from the first game, whilst later versions include a pre-generated party and the ability to create new characters. As the game is intended to be played by those who have successfully completed the first game, the difficulty level is intended for characters of at least level 13, and no training area means that lower level characters will go through a "baptism by fire". Mechanical differences include the ability to save the game in the dungeon rather than forcing the characters to exit the dungeon and return to the training grounds, and some of the spells increasing in power (as noted by a message in the dungeon).

Unlike the first scenario, where half of the levels had no purpose plot-wise and could be skipped if the player wished, exploration all of the levels in Knight of Diamonds is necessary to complete the game. Each of the six levels has a piece of the Knight's armor somewhere in the level, and all of the pieces must be collected in order to finish the game. Furthermore, unlike in the first scenario, there are no elevators that can be used to skip levels, and teleportation spells will fail if the party attempts to use them to teleport to a level that has not yet been reached via stairs.

Gameplay:

The game begins with the city of Llylgamyn under siege. Llylgamyn's rulers have been killed, and the city's only hope is for the recovery of the staff of Gnilda, only obtainable from trading the mystic "Knight of Diamonds" armor from the legendary Knight of Diamonds to fend off the invaders.

Ironsword: Wizards &amp; Warriors II is the second video game in the Wizards and Warriors trilogy for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by Zippo Games for Rare and first released in 1989 by Acclaim. The hero of the series, Kuros, must face off once again against the evil wizard Malkil, who has taken control of the four elementals of the worldwind, water, fire and earth.

Each of the four elemental realms consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kuros must find a golden artifact which belongs to the Animal King of the realm; once accomplished, the path to the second part of the realm will appear. In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros will pick up a piece of the legendary Iron Sword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.

A few new elements were introduced in this installment of the series. Gems and keys still exist, although the former are used for monetary purposes and the latter can be stored to open any chest Kuros comes across. Shops are located in each level, which sell weapons, food and magic spells. Kuros can also gamble in a game of chance at each shop, where the goal is to guess which cup a skull will land in. New to the series were magic spells which give Kuros special abilities for a limited period of time. Some spells can be used at any time, while others are only for specific situations.

Although the game is slightly easier than its predecessor, continues are now limited. The player can only rely on two continues, and cannot continue the game at any point after completing the Fire stage (the third of five major levels). Despite this, the game still includes a 12-letter password system.

When Kuros last did battle with the Evil Wizard Malkil atop Icefire Mountain, he raised his Ironsword in triumph and glory... or so he thought. Suddenly, a powerful bolt of magic has robbed Kuros of his armor, memory, and honor. But the distant presence of evil stirs in his mind, leading him to the once fair city of Piedup, the very same place where the villainous soul of Malkil survives. Without his armor, Kuros will need crafty disguises to travel undetected, ready to do battle as a wizard, nobleman or thief. His quest will take him from the depths of the dungeon to the palace containing riches beyond belief - building strength, perfecting fighting skills and acquiring rare knowledge of magic along the way. The time has come for Kuros to turn his visions of power... into reality!

The game takes place immediately following the events of Ironsword, with the evil wizard Malkil escaping from Kuros and taking refuge in the town of Piedup. Malkil has taken the form of King James of Piedup, taking control of the town in the process.

Gameplay:

Unlike the previous games in the series, the gameplay takes place in three main areas; the town of Piedup, the caves underneath and the castle above it. Kuros is free to travel between all three areas, but will need certain skills to advance further. These skills come from joining three guilds in the game, each revolving around a certain class; Knight, Thief and Wizard. To advance in rank at each of these guilds, Kuros must find the statue, which corresponds to the guild's level; bronze statues for first level guilds, silver statues for second level guilds and gold statues for third level guilds. Each class has its own unique abilities, which evolve throughout the course of the game; Kuros is free to switch between classes at any time, except during boss battles or during guild tests.

Due to the game's open-ended nature, exploration is necessary to find all necessary items and secrets. Most doors can be entered with a key, which can be purchased at an inn; however, some passages can only be accessed using certain skills. Most of the important items in the game are guarded by boss monsters.

Unlike the past games in the series, there is no continue mechanism; once Kuros loses all of his lives, the game ends. There are no hidden continues, nor is there any way to restore a life once its been lost. Even though there is no continue mechanism, the game is drastically easier than its predecessors. It is possible for Kuros to avoid almost all damage by using the appropriate class in its respective area.

Controls:

A button - jump in the air
B button - fires your weapon (if able to)
Up - aims your weapon up
Down - squat down (try walking while squatting :)
Start - pauses the game so you can get a snack
Select - brings up your forms menu

Hints:

You need only to buy 14 keys for the whole game. Each key is used to open: All 3 Thief Guilds, The 1st and 2nd Knight and Wizards Guilds, the Bronze and Silver Thief and Knight statues, and all 3 Wizard statues.

Beat the Wizards Bosses easily: Stand right where the tip of their staff would be if they were thrusting it, and keep stabbing them until their dead. They won't be able to hit you! It might take a bit of practice, but you'll get it!

Best stabbing technique: Hold down the B button and press down. This is the easiest way to kill enemies without getting too close.

She's asleep now, the Princess. But who knows what he has planned for her once she awakens...

He is the Wizard Malkil.

Legend has it that Malkil was once one of the greatest. So great, in fact, that even the renowned Merlin was his pupil. But alas, Malkil has gone mad with age, and turned his powerful magic to the dark side.

You are Kuros, the only knight warrior brave enough to enter the woods of Elrond. Strong enough to wield the Brightsword. Powerful enough to ward off the demons, the undead, and the caverns of fire. And clever enough to discover where Malkil has hidden his prisoner.

--From the NES Wizards &amp; Warriors instruction manual.

Directions:

There was a lot of fun to be had in customizing your character. There were items to find throughout the game that would improve your warrior. There were, in fact, more items than there was room in your inventory. That meant you had to make a decision sometimes. Don't worry though; they wouldn't put you in a situation where you needed an item that was unattainable. I recommend you find and keep the boots of force. They will open any chest that you find without needing the key. Be sure to find all three keys in each level for extra points. At the end of the game you will find Malkil waiting for you and he is pretty tuff. 

Controls:

A Button Jump
B Button Attack
Start Button Start/Pause
Select Button Use Item

Hints:

-Secret Rooms
There are secret rooms throughout the game. Look for them by jumping around randomly.

You are Wolverine.

You were just on the receiving end of the evil Dr. Cornelius' horrific experiments. They turned you into a walking switchblade, and now you're angry. In this Action/Adventure game you're on a mission to find answers about your mysterious past, but along the way you are confronted by the bloodthirsty Sabretooth and the evil Magneto. Now you and the X-men are the only ones who can save the world.

WOLVERINE uses classic NES graphics, and the sound quality is good. The general game play starts slow, but picks up later in the game, and can get addicting.

Directions:

As Wolverine, you are given a set of ADAMANTIUM CLAWS. These will serve as your weapons. Use them to cut down enemies and jump from pieces of land or pipes, and try to make it to the exit or defeat the boss. Look out for items along the way, like the health hamburger or the berserker rage bottle. For each enemy you kill, you get two bars on the berserker rage meter. Be sure to look for your friends Jubilee, Havok, and Psylocke. They will give you key items that you will need, to proceed to other levels.

Controls:

A Button Punch/Claw
B Button Jump
Start Button Pause
Select Button Extend/retract claws

Hints:

-Invincible Berserker
When Berserker Rage meter is full, you are temporarily invincible

The Oliver Twins have today announced the release of a brand new Dizzy game, although it may not be the series revival fans were hoping for.

At a special event at The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge to mark the launch of a Kickstarter fund for a book celebrating their careers as game developers, brothers Andrew and Phillip Oliver revealed the immediate release of Wonderland Dizzy, a game that had been thought lost for 22 years.

Fans won't have to shell out for Wonderland Dizzy though; it's free for all to play right now in browsers and is the first game in the Dizzy series to give players control over another member of the Yolkfolk - Dizzy's girlfriend Daisy.

Wonderland Dizzy was discovered five months ago, after the twins accidently stumbled across a map for the game in a box of props they'd brought along with them to Play Blackpool, where they were hosting a talk about their early work. After the talk, the brothers discussed the game and realized that they couldn't remember if it had even been finished. This led Philip to search his loft where he found, amongst all the clutter, a disc bearing the Wonderland Dizzy name.

"Sadly the finished compiled game file wasn't there, but all the source code and graphics were," Philip told Eurogamer.

After writing to Andrew Joseph of Dizzy fan site Yolkfolk.com, the twins were put in touch with a Polish Dizzy fan named Lukasz Kur, who managed to convert the files into a working ROM image.

Lukasz also took the time to fix a few bugs and add a 'Fun Mode', which grants the player infinite lives - played in classic mode the game can be very difficult to beat.

But how is it possible to forget a game you've made, especially one that features your most beloved creation? "During the space of '84 to '93 we produced 50 games." Philip explained.

"That's not counting different platforms. If you actually multiply by platforms there's an average of two or three that we personally produced. So it was over 100 different SKUs that we programmed personally, so it was very easy to sort of forget one or two!"

It wasn't just a lapse in memory that contributed to the loss of Wonderland though. The game was originally intended to be a full price release but Codemasters' marketing department decided it wasn't prepared to publish it.

"Like gamblers you try to forget the bad stuff and quite frankly we were very, very upset by it", Philip remembers. "We did fall out with Codemasters big time over several unreleased games, that being one of them." 

It was this period that signaled the end of The Oliver Twins working relationship with Codemasters. After they left to start their own studio, Wonderland Dizzy was consigned to the loft and its existence slowly faded from their memories.

Thankfully, the bad blood is all in the past and Codies were happy to give this new release their blessing. "Because they wanted to release the Dizzy iPhone game a few years ago, we put an agreement in place at that time that any new games could be released - that we could release new games. That said I still went and had a meeting out of courtesy and told them. So it's all fine and actually Frank Sagnier (Codemasters' new CEO) was very happy about it."

The Twins teased the release of Wonderland Dizzy last month with a cryptic tweet that lead some fans to believe a brand new game for modern machines was in the works. For those fans this retro release may come as a bit of a disappointment, so we asked Philip what the chances would be of a proper new release.

"Probably quite slim, which is not want you want to hear as a Dizzy fan! We're busy working on SkySaga." (the free-to-play Minecraft-inspired MMO the Twins are currently producing with their company Radiant Worlds). "SkySaga just takes all of our attention and we've got a massively talented team here and if you think anything that might have been in a Dizzy next gen - SkySagas got a lot of spirit of that anyway. It's kind of what we're doing but it's on a level like a hundred times what Dizzy could have ever been."

The Oliver Twins previously tried to resurrect the Dizzy franchise on modern computers via a Kickstarter campaign for a game called Dizzy Returns but they admitted defeat after only raising &#xA3;24,605 - over &#xA3;325,000 shy of the &#xA3;350,000 target.

    <desc>Woody Poko was a pretty mediocre Famicom game that was (unsurprisingly) never localized outside of Japan. It's a pretty simple adventure game in which you can walk and jump around, kill enemies, collect money and items, use those items to reach more locations and then progress through the game's levels.

This hack was finished about a year before I ever actually released it anywhere. In the mean time, apparently someone translated the MSX version of the game, which is probably both a way better game and a way better translation hack. You should probably play that one, honestly.

Running Stadium was developed and published by Bandai and was released in Japan in 1986 and in North America in 1987 under the title Stadium Events. However, shortly after release, Nintendo purchased the North American rights to the Family Fun Fitness series and decided to market the series themselves. As a result, Stadium Events was renamed and repackaged under the title World Class Track Meet, and all Family Fun Fitness mats and copies of Stadium Events were pulled from store shelves. Stadium Events has become the hardest to find licensed game available on the Nintendo Entertainment System; there exist less than 10 known complete (cartridge, manual, and box) copies of Stadium Events.

Despite the changes, the three games remain identical to one another, aside from the name change on the title screen. The game featured an Olympics-style competition, with events such as the 100m dash, 110m hurdles, long jump, and triple jump. Race opponents were named after animals, the slowest being Turtle and the fastest being Cheetah.

Big Apple crime is rotten to the core. Now, there's only one way to keep the peace. The way of the Ninja! Introducing the deadliest fighting skills the game world has ever seen! Ten awesome powers, including: Art of Invisibility. Disappear and become invulnerable to attack. Art of Fire Ring: incinerate enemies caught in your deadly ring of fire. Art of Teleportation: Freeze time to reposition yourself and surprise attackers.

The story takes place in New York City. Black Manta, a ninja, gets a call that kids are being kidnapped. Now, Black Ninja must go out to the streets and uncover the plans that involve the kids and maybe even drugs!

Directions:

Classic side-scrolling tradition. You fight baddies.

In order to really beat the game, you must use your arts to succeed. Grab the red-shirt guys because they give up info to you. Cowards. You could also save kids that are in buildings and factories, which is good, because they give good info and power-ups! At each stage, you face a boss with a distinct fighting pattern.

Controls:

A Button Jump
B Button Throw weapon
Start Button Pause, Unpause
Select Button Display arts

This Nintendo Programmable game lets you design your own buildings, place barriers where you want them, and then get set to demolish them in record time. So you can build a different maze of obstacles to tear down every game! You can also choose to knock through a series of walls pre-programmed by Nintendo. Each wall gets tougher, and you have to be clever to keep away from monsters like "Gotcha Wrench" and "Egg Plant Man", blazing Fireballs, and the mean "Foreman Spike".

--From the NES Wrecking Crew instruction manual.

Overview:

Another great Nintendo game starring Mario, this time as a demolitionist. Grab your Hammer and get ready to Wreck!

Directions:

This is sort of a puzzle game in that you have to figure out how to get all the breakable objects broken, while avoiding monsters and such. Of course in the early stages it's pretty simple but you'll have to figure out a few tricks to get through the later rounds.

There are 100 in all. Also, here's a fun feature: if you don't like the scenes that are provided in the game you can create your own. Build a building just for the fun of smashing it down, or build a real puzzler and challenge your friends.

Flat walls, support beams and white ladders take 1 hit, light bricks take 2, and dark bricks take 3 hits. Hitting a bomb will destroy a row of consecutive objects and knock down enemies, but it will knock Mario down too if he stays in front of it.

One warning note: your hammer is not an offensive weapon; you can't hurt your enemies with it. Knock open the green doors to send the bad guys over to the wrong side of the wall, and then you'll be safe for a while. 

Controls:

A Button Swing Hammer
B Button Swing Hammer
Start Button Start or Pause
Select Button Return to Main Menu

Hints:

-Golden Hammer
In some screens there is a chance to get a super strong hammer which will make your life easier and the level faster. It will be hidden inside certain bombs, and you have to destroy the right objects in a certain sequence to get it. If you see objects popping out of a bomb, it's a clue that the level could contain a magic hammer. A Duck tells you you're not getting it right but lets you know it can be done. A Santa Clause tells you that you've got a good deal of the sequence right, and a Bunny tells you you're very close to the winning sequence.

The year is 1999. Strange phenomena has begun to take place on the surface of the earth. Destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have scarred the earth, altering the vital ecological balance of our planet.

Worried leaders of the world have summoned their brightest scientists to discuss the possible reasons and repercussions if the phenomenon continues to destroy the planet.

A decision has been made to mobilize a team of scientists to explore the phenomena deep below the surface. With the Marine Corps as the crew, a multi-configuration vehicle, the VZR, was prepared for the mission. Those that have seen a VZR in action have begun to call it the Wurm.

One by one, four VZRs were quickly dispatched. All four became lost and any attempts to establish contact with the lost crews proved to be futile.

A special unit of the Marines has been called in to rescue the vanished crews in the face of what appears to be more than just geological phenomena.

But as the young Marines boarded the Wurm, they couldn't help but wonder: "What happened to the others?"

--From the NES Wurm instruction manual.

Additionally, players can battle the entire roster through a string of singles matches to become WWF Champion. Also available are exhibition matches in singles and tag team modes for one or two players.

Each of the game's wrestlers possess the same basic moveset, consisting of punches, kicks, a body slam, a suplex, a throw, a dropkick, stomps, elbow drops, and a move off the turnbuckle. There are no signature moves. However, each wrestler varies in speed, strength, and stamina attributes.

Featured wrestlers:

- Bam Bam Bigelow (NES version only)
- Bret Hart
- Hulk Hogan
- Lex Luger
- Mr. Perfect
- Randy Savage
- Razor Ramon
- Shawn Michaels
- The Undertaker (NES version only)
- Yokozuna
- "You" - A generic character which the player can name and distribute attribute points for. When playing the title tournament with this character, his stats can be upgraded after each victory. Though limited, this is one of the earliest examples of a create-a-wrestler mode.

Wrestlemania. The granddaddy of them all. The Superbowl of pro wrestling, if you will. And the steel cage...What an unforgiving structure. Two men enter it, but one man will win the watch. There is a chance, though, that neither man will be the same afterwards. Take a step back into yesteryear with the stars of the WWF, from The Immortal Hulk Hogan to Bret "Hitman" Hart to "Rowdy" Roddy Piper!

Recommended...only for those with a sense of nostalgia in them. Because that's one of the few high points of this game. The graphics are less than average, even for a Nintendo game, the wrestler models looking small and somewhat blocky. The sound is all right, having the theme song for each wrestler. The game-play lacks as well in a sense, the controls being sloppy and unresponsive at times. Play only if you want a taste of nostalgic wrestling action.

Directions:

In this game, you have a choice of ten wrestlers to play as: The Mountie, Ted DiBiase, I.R.S, Bret Hart, Sid Justice, Randy Savage, Roddy Piper, The Undertaker, Jake Roberts, and Hulk Hogan.

There are four different game modes you can play in. One On One is when you pick a wrestler of your choosing and you fight another wrestler. You can choose whether to use a steel cage or not. Tag Team is when a team of two goes at it against another team of two in tag action! In Tag Team Championship, you fight your way up a ladder of opponents in a team against other teams to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. WWF Championship is like Tag Team Championship, only with one person fighting a ladder of single opponents to win the WWF Championship. Each mode has a different difficulty, but only in One On One and Tag Team can you change it to your liking.

During a match, your goal is to pin your opponent down for a three count. You do this by weakening your opponent enough by using different moves and strategies. Every match may bring new lessons, in a way, so be sure to pay attention to each match you play in!

Featured wrestlers: 

- Bret Hart
- Hulk Hogan
- Irwin R. Schyster
- Jake Roberts
- The Mountie
- Randy Savage
- Roddy Piper
- Sid Justice
- Ted DiBiase
- The Undertaker

This game features many of the WWF greats, such as Ravishing Rick Rude, The Big Boss Man, Andre The Giant, "The Macho Man" Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan, Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake, and The Ultimate Warrior. You can go through a small career trying to become the WWF Wrestling Champion by playing as you. There are also one on one playdowns. Tag Teams of 2 Vs. 2 are also another option. The survivor series is where 3 wrestlers take on 3 wrestlers, and the last team standing after the other has been eliminated is the winner.

Wrestlemania. The biggest wrestling event ever. Only the best succeed. Play as many legends and show 'em who's boss!

Featured wrestlers:

- Hulk Hogan
- Andr? the Giant
- "Macho Man" Randy Savage
- The Honky Tonk Man
- Bam Bam Bigelow
- "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase

Gameplay:

All wrestlers possess a limited amount of moves, which comprise of basic standing punches and kicks, headbutts, a running attack, a move off the turnbuckle (Andr? the Giant can't do this), and a body slam (Bam Bam Bigelow and Honky Tonk Man can't do this). All wrestlers also possess a "back attack" that they can use on an opponent standing behind them (usually a backwards punch). The moves themselves are somewhat tailored to each wrestler (Randy Savage, for example, uses elbow smashes instead of punches, while Bam Bam Bigelow has two running attacks instead of one). The wrestlers cannot leave the ring and can only execute turnbuckle attacks from the bottom two corners. Sometimes, while a wrestler is being pounded on, they will turn red, indicating anger. An "angry" wrestler can inflict more damage than normal while in this state. Sometimes during a match, an icon will come on screen that a wrestler can pick up to gain health. The icons are unique to each wrestler (for example, Honky Tonk Man's looks like a guitar, while Hulk Hogan's looks like a crucifix) and cannot be used interchangeably (wrestlers can only pick up their own icons).

Players can either play a single exhibition match (one player versus the computer or two players head-to-head) or a tournament. In a single player tournament, the player chooses one wrestler and must defeat the other five in a series of matches to win the championship. In a tournament with two or more player-controlled wrestlers (up to six can play), each wrestler faces every other wrestler once (fifteen total matches). At the end of the tournament, the wrestler with the best record wins the championship. In the event of a tie, the wrestler in the tie who achieved the single fastest victory during the tournament will be declared the winner.

Trivia:

-The 2008 film "The Wrestler" features a game graphically inspired by WrestleMania, with similar looking characters and the missing front ring ropes.

-It was the first WWF licensed video game, meaning it featured actual WWF wrestlers as opposed to fictional characters like previous wrestling games.

Controls:

A Button Selects wrestler, enters letter
B Button Get on turnbuckle
Start Button Pause, Unpause
Select Button Select number of players

Zee-no-phobe: fear of anything alien. At first glance, you'd never guess there was a living thing aboard the deserted star base. But inside, it's alive and crawling - with the most gruesome hoard of alien life forms in the arcade galaxy. They lurk around every corner; they blend into every background. They multiply, they metamorphize, they jump from room to room and screen to screen. Watch out or you'll get slimed! So grab your joystick and get ready for the latest, most frightening split-screen action imaginable. Xenophobe conquered the arcade. Now it wants you!

GAME OBJECTIVES
1. To exterminate hostile alien life forms (called "Xenos") that are infesting derelict space stations and moon bases.
2. To collect various forms of valuable hardware found at each derelict space station and moon base. 

Directions:

Xenophobe is a port from an arcade game which originally allowed up to three players at the same time. The NES version uses a split screen, with Player 1 in the top and Player 2 in the bottom. The graphics are somewhat lacking, but Xenophobe is surprisingly fun to play, with its variety of characters, monsters, and items.

First you get to choose your character from three Xenophobe Exterminators.

As far as I know this is merely an aesthetic choice, but none of your options are particularly pleasing to the eye. Next your ship delivers you to the base, where your job is to kill everything that moves. Some enemies will drop items which you can pick up, including ID cards, Fuel, Medicine, Skulls, Tools, and Knives. They are worth bonus points at the end of the mission, and some give you back some of your lost health. Occasionally you can also get weapons upgrades. These include the Laser Pistol, Lightning Gun, Smoke Gun, and Bombs. The Smoke Gun has the most powerful shot but a very short range.

A great variety of enemies await, some apparently fixed to certain locations, others appearing randomly wherever your explorations take you. There is no set number of enemies or items per level, so just destroy as many as you can in order to clear the mission. If you take too long, the base will self-destruct! 

Controls:

A Button Jump, Get Item, Sit or crawl (+Down), Stand up, Call Elevator, Throw Bomb
B Button Fire Weapon
Start Button Start, Pause Game
Select Button Choose 1 or 2 Players, Choose Exterminator

Hints:

Watch your health carefully. There are only three ways to get health back in Xenophobe: find Medicine, find the Coffee Cup, and clear the level of Xenos. Since you can't count on finding the power-ups you need, concentrate on killing Xenos as quickly as possible. If the end message says, "Overrun by Xenos" then you lose points and don't recover any health points.

In the year 2777, the earth existed in a totally different atmosphere. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, the population decreased dramatically and only five small islands existed on the surface of the earth. Those five islands formed a nation and for hundreds of years people lived peacefully. The new nation is called XEXYZ. At XEXYZ, aside from human beings, there exist fairies and spirits who lived under the ruling of King Xeu Star. But one day, the mechanic fortress, GORUZA, from outer space, attacked XEXYZ. XEXYZ did not have many weapons to fight back and was forced to surrender. GORUZA built mechanic castles on each island, captured a queen from each island and confined them. King Xeu Star was murdered and his only daughter, Maria Star, has been missing since then. Battle-soldier Apollo could not endure the cruel treatment of GORUZA any longer. So he put on his space battle suit and challenged the mechanic beasts' empire! 

--From the NES Xexyz instruction manual.

Directions:

Some will give you helth or more money. Their are several rooms and side quests before you can save the princess. Make sure your health doesn't empty out and make sure to sue your gone to kill any oppositin you may face. Enter ever area you can to see what is inside, good or bad!

WHAT NOIVE!

Somebody's wrecking New York City! Or maybe it's a whole gang! Wherever you go, hooligans jump out and knock you down. Can you imagine the noive!

For instance, try strolling on the wharf, and get flapped by a fish. Or go skateboarding in Central Park -- you'll get shredded by dive-bombers. And with loonies everywhere, what a time for a brownout in the Bronx!

This is what the NOID is up against, and more! In fact, it looks like his duplicate Mr. Green is causing all the antics. That's double trouble!

But the NOID's got plenty of ammo -- supernatural powers, incredible inventions, and a whiz-bang yo-yo. He just needs a pizza every now and then to keep him going!

--From the NES Yo! Noid instruction manual.

Directions:

Yo! Noid is a game of challenge, and the first indication of this is the lack of a life meter for the Noid. This means that if he's hit by an enemy, only once, he dies and you lose a life. So at times, you'll find yourself memorizing certain spots in order to overcome them easier.

But you'll need to move hastily; you have a time limit.

The Noid has a very unique means of offense to the enemies coming at him: his trusty yo-yo. With one whip of this yo-yo, he can attack enemies and cause them to fly off of the screen. Also, by collecting the scrolls in the levels, you can heighten the Noid's magic meter or find power-ups, the latter of which are found by opening large scrolls with the yo-yo.

Speaking on the magic abilities of the Noid, he can use them but at a cost. Using magic depletes the magic meter at the bottom of the screen and must be replenished with the use of scrolls: small ones filling one unit and large ones filling five units. These large scrolls could also contain the magic abilities. Amongst these are the Light Burst which kills all enemies on screen and the Dark Noid which gives our hero temporary running and jumping boosts.

What really separates this title from the rest in the NES library, or the whole video game spectrum for that matter, is the pizza-eating contests you'll find yourself in. Taking place at the end of every odd numbered stage, these serve as your bosses. The object of these card game battles is to eat more pizza than your differently colored Noid opponent. In order to win, you have to fill your pizza meter completely before your opponent does, and choosing your pizza cards wisely is how you do it. You have to choose a number of pizzas, and try to choose more than your opponent: if you choose a greater number than he does, you win the difference. To tilt the odds more in your favor, bonus cards can be found in the levels and can be useful, the pepper cards making your opponent lose a turn and the roman numeral cards multiplying their value double or triple.

Like with many games, Yo! Noid gives you the opportunity to compete in bonus levels. By access of invisible portals, you'll find yourself in games that resemble "Whack-A-Mole." You walk around an area with either 10 or 12 holes and you have to strike the moles as they pop out of their hiding places. If you hit enough during the elapsed time of 30 seconds, you get an extra continue and, if you're in an odd numbered stage, lets you skip the pizza-eating contest. Keep in mind, though: these bonus levels are nothing short of a challenge, and failure to clear these bonus levels results in the loss of a life and going back to the beginning of the level. 

Trivia:

The game is a modified version of an earlier Japanese release called Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru.

Yoshi's Cookie is a fast-paced puzzle game that can be enjoyed by everyone, as it is easy to play, but challenging to complete! To play, move the randomly placed cookies (HEART, FLOWER, DIAMOND, CHECK, CIRCLE and YOSHI [Yoshi's face]) into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear and you can start working on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" Cookie is very special in both the 1-player game, a screen-clearing game, and the 2-player game, a race that lets you test a friend's skill. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely to avoid sticky situations.

--From the NES Yoshi's Cookie instruction manual.

Directions:

Not resembling the original Yoshi, in this game you try to match cookie patterns by sliding them to complete a full row or column. Move the cursor to the desired row and hold it in place as you use the directional buttons to slide the row.

When all the cookies on a row match, it will disappear.

The cookies will collapse and any rows that are completed by the elimination of the previous row will disappear too. Get a large combo for a high score. Fill up the red blocks to the side of the cookies and you will get a Yoshi cookie which is a wild card and will eliminate some pesky mismatched cookies for you if you play it right.

Once again, the supposed Mario is the one pulling the levers you control! He's everywhere! 

Controls:

A Button Hold To Move Column
B Button Speed up new Cookies
Start Button Start Round/Pause
Select Button Select Players

Hints: 

-Beyond Round 10
At the Options screen, select High Speed and Music Off, then go back up to Round and hold Up as you press select. You'll be able to start on any round from 1-99. Then you can turn the speed back down if you want, you get new choices for music, and the cookies are replaced by some familiar little guys (if you've played the original Yoshi)!

Yoshi is an action puzzle game starring Mario's dinosaur buddy Yoshi, and other familiar characters like Little Goomba and Blooper. Once again, Mario is going to have to battle away to save Yoshi, who is imprisoned in an egg. Match the eggshells to release Yoshi and score big points! 

--From the NES Yoshi instruction manual.

Directions:

By controlling Mario at the bottom of the platform, make Mario flip the columns so the falling pieces match 2 enemies of Mario's. The 4 possible enemy matches are some of Mario's most recognizable enemies (Squid, Goomba, Boo, and Piranha). You can also get enemies trapped between 2 halves of the eggshell and the egg will fall and eliminate each one and make a Yoshi baby. In 2 modes, both resembling Tetris, a "free score" mode and an "eliminate all enemies" mode. Go wild on Yoshi's debut game! 

Controls:

A Button Flip Columns
B Button Flip Columns
Start Button Start/Pause
Select Button Select Players

Hints: 

-Column Switch
Remember you can switch columns even while waiting for things to fall. Watch the top of the screen to see what's next, and try to set up for the next turn before the current objects get all the way down. This can be especially useful if you switch a falling object with a column higher than that object. The object keeps falling at the same rate and gives you some time to plan.

    <desc>YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH! This game totally kicks it old-skewl! This second book of Falcom's classic Ys series is much like it's predecessor. It plays kinda like Zelda, where you run around various landscapes in an overhead view with real-time combat. Except it's cooler than Zelda because you actually have to charge through the enemy and run it through. The plot also has TONS of depth, even for an Nes game. The game also improves somewhat on the original Ys, by adding magic into the equation, as well as a larger arsenal of weapons, puzzles that are more difficult, and the fact that you can actually SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING in the dungeons. So play the game! Please.

Translation Description:

David and his anonymous friend did a wonderful job on this translation, and it's a great game, and I heartily recommend it. Now, if only someone would pick up Ys 5...

    <desc>This yet another port of another game in Falcom's Ys series. Why is this series of games ported to EVERY platform? Because it rules, that's why. Unfortunately, this particular Ys game is the black sheep. First of all, it's a side-scroller. Second, it is insanely (infuriatingly, even) difficult. I never beat the SNES version without the invincibility code. It's that hard. And this one has no such code. Hopefully some of the later stages are easier because the NES can't handle the amount of sprites the SNES could. Either way, check this game out, or don't. If you do, I can't be held responsible if you end up hurling your gamepad at the wall in frustration.

Translation Description:

After being worked on for a period of several YEARS, this thing is finally done! The script has been fully edited and polished, making this a very nice looking translation indeed. No known bugs or issues exist with this patch, but if any are found, Kitsune wants to hear about it so he can fix them. Otherwise, this translation seems very complete. Enjoy!

    <desc>Woo-hoo! This is a most excellent translation of a most excellent game. If you haven't tried it yet, Ys play very much similar to Zelda, but is twice as fun and the dialogue is 10 times more engrossing. And it's pretty challenging, too! This is definitely the version of Ys to get, unless you happen to read Japanese or own a Turbo Duo. Heh.

Translation Description:

Makoknight and Co. did an excellent job with the translation; this is truly what I'd call a flawless script. It's much truer to the Ys saga than the Sega Translation was, and much more grammatically correct. So, what are you waiting for? Find the ROM, download the patch, and have a blast!

The "system" was created by an organic intelligence body many millenniums ago and began attacking the human race. The earth was thrown into turmoil with only one hope for salvation. Fighter model AFX-6502 ZANAC was perfected by the 256th Riot Fleet to ward off the enemy system. It's your job, as ZANAC, to save the human race. Using eight special weapons and secret power forces buried along the way, guide ZANAC through 12 screens of enemy creatures to victory.

Storyline:

First it was probably a tiny dot. A few thousand years later, it grew gigantic enough to cover the whole universe. The system created by an organic intelligence body a long time agp was still active even after the organic intelligence body perished. The system had a purpose: giving wisdom to those who opened the icon properly, and giving punishment of ruin to those who opened it improperly.

One day, someone opened the icon improperly. The system started operation and startted attacking them. Then, they opened it properly. The icon ordered the system to suspend the attack. The system however ignored this order and became a slaughter device. The human beings who opened the icon fell into crisis. The attack from the system overwhelmed the offensive power of the human beings. When they were about to perish, there was one hope - the system is basically a strategic machine and is equipped for fighting against a multitude. If a single object confronts the system by itself, the system might not be able to cope with it effectively.

It was a risky gamble, yet it was carried out in hope of success. They produced the fighter model AFX-6502-ZANAC which took off to begin fighting alone against the system.

--From the NES Zanac instruction manual.

Controls:

D-Pad - Move
A - Special
B - Fire
Start - Pause
Select - Not Used

Hints:

Periodically, you will find a weapon upgrade. The Conventional Weapon is usually upgraded by collecting the POWER CHIPS dropped by Boxes. You can upgrade or switch Special Weapons by collecting the numbered bonus, which you receive, from Ground Targets or WEAPON DROPs.

    <desc>This is probably the best Zelda hack out there. Almost every single thing possible to modify in the game has been modified. This hack exemplifies the talented individuals in our community. Anybody even remotely interested in ROMhacking should give this one a try!

The old world map has been completely overwritten by the new one. You are guaranteed not to recognize any locations from the previous game. All location of dungeons and secreats have been changed as well.

Secrets are now locked according to what quest you're playing. For example, the rock you push to find a dungeon won't move on the second quest, so you have to find a new entrance somewhere else in the world. The game allows each secret to be set to 1st Quest, 2nd Quest, both, or neither. So, many places where you can bomb, burn, push things and use the recorder are quest-specific.

Most of the monsters have new graphics (including all bosses) and some even have new colors.

There are 42 possible block, water &amp; statue arrangements for the many dungeon rooms, and all but 3 are brand new.

That's just a taste of what has been changed and how much work went into this hack!

It will feel like a new game. Most of the overworld has been changed as well as the 7 palaces. There are all new puzzles in every single area of the game and some of them will most likely get you stumped! If you like Zelda II, then you will definitely like this hack.

    <desc>This hack is a continuation of the original Zelda II. It was created with one goal in mind, and that is to provide a challenge. Fortunately, there are 3 patches available to download: Easy, Medium, and Hard. This way, if you don't like challenging games, you will have other options to select from.

It will feel like a new game. Most of the overworld has been changed as well as the 7 palaces. There are all new puzzles in every single area of the game and some of them will most likely get you stumped! If you like Zelda II, then you will definitely like this hack.

Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep.

In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.

Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). There are many faraway locations and towns to visit, with a variety of weapons, spells, and armors to find which will help you on your quest. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.

Gameplay:

The Adventure of Link bears little resemblance to the first game in the series. The Adventure of Link features side-scrolling areas within a larger world map rather than the top-down view of the previous title. The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more RPG elements, including an experience points (EXP) system, magic spells, and more interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). Link has extra lives; no other game in the series includes this feature.

Hints:

Special save screen
Make sure you have two controllers in. Now on controller 1 pause the game, on controller 2 press up and A at the same time. You will be taken to a menu where you can save or continue. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Use Sword
Start Button: Pause, bring up Inventory
Select Button: Cast selected spell

Various ancient legends have been recorded of a young boy clothed in green, wielding the mythical master sword, sealing away all evil throughout the land. His ventures, passed down through generations have become legend. The hero of legend, had many different forms. He saved many kingdoms, restoring peace in all the lands. This is but one of the legends, of which the people speak...

Here is a ROM hack for the Legend of Zelda which has had many hours put into it (just shy of 3 years), ASM and coding changes, and graphics overhauls. New items have replaced the old ones in the original game and new concepts have been used in the game such as pitfalls, dash boots, the use of the hammer, and many more changes have been added to give the game a much new feel to it. Also the inclusion of the Capcom sound engine is another welcome change that has been added to the game.

For more details on the patch and how the project progressed over time please visit this site to take a look at how it started and how it came to its closing end.

http://acmlm.kafuka.org/board/thread.php?id=7308

Please use the PRG0 version of the ROM otherwise the ROM will not work properly. Enjoy!

!!!!WARNING!!!! - FOR THOSE UPDATING, YOU MUST DELETE ANY PREVIOUSLY CREATED IN-GAME SAVES FROM WHICH EVER EMULATOR. THIS NEW UPDATE NEEDS TO START FRESH, SINCE THE SRAM HAS BEEN ALTERED. YOU WILL GET A GREY SCREEN UPON BOOTUP IF YOU DON'T.

Now for the rom specs

    Converted from MMC1 to MMC5
    1MB PRG-ROM
    1MB CHR-ROM
    32KB SRAM
    Inserted custom MMC5 irq engine
    Installed custom modified Capcom 6C80 Sound Engine, with DPCM usage

Will this work on...? This game will NOT work on the N8 Everdrive, or PowerPak's. The N8 Everdrive uses 512kb PRG &amp; CHR-ROM. The author contacted the creator, but he wasn't interested in creating a revision to his product. PowerPak's are in the same boat. Loopy's MMC5 patch works on MMC5 games, but, my work is too large for it to handle.

The game has been tested on the following emulators

    FCEUX PC
    Nestopia PC
    Nintendulator PC v0.975 Unofficial Release
    Nintendulator PC v0.970 Official Release
    nesDS Special Build
    Retroarch Using Nestopia Core Wii/WiiU
    (Android Users) - NESEmu
    (XBOX Users) - NestopiaX Ver 1.4 and up

There is a fast way to learn if the romhack will play perfectly on an emulator you use. Watch the intro after the title screen fades away. There is a golden scroll moving up the screen. If that scroll &amp; text comes up garbage, then you should stop playing unfortunately. This is because the emulator you are using, is not utilizing the MMC5 register $5130 correctly. The romhack perform chr swaps for 3 specific things, the intro, a mini game, and the Ganon fight. If you continue to play the game with the garbaged gfx, it will obviously look bad, and it might even crash.

Zen: Intergalactic Ninja, based on a comic book of the same name, is a story about a militant environmentalist ninja named Zen. He has been assigned by a group of green, pointy-headed aliens to come to earth and stop environmental pollution by any means necessary. Eventually, he will have to find the big polluter, Lord Contaminous. The game play consists of side scrolling and isometric 3D scrolling action. Zen can run, jump, slice with this stick, or use powerups as the game requires.

History:

"Zen: Intergalactic Ninja" was one of the two NES games that Konami released in 1993, the other being "Tiny Toons 2". 1993 was a year during which systems like the Genesis and Super NES gained more popularity among gamers while the NES didn't receive as much attention anymore. It might be one of the reasons why the game isn't as well-known as most of the other carts Konami made for the NES over the years; it might also be partly caused by the play control, which doesn't initially feel as crisp as it is in other Konami games.

Controls:

All Stages

Jump: Press the A button.
Attack: Press the B button. 
Use Life Item: Press the Select button.

Side-View Stages:

Crouch: Press the Control Pad down.

Hang from a branch or pipe: Press the Control Pad up and press the A button to move and the B button to kick.

Drop to a floor below: Press the Control Pad down together with the A button.

Rebound Jump: When you hit a wall, press the Control Pad in the direction of the wall and at the same time press the A button. By doing this consecutively, you can climb to a high place.

Jab: Press the Control button in the direction of the enemy and at the same time press the B button to jab attack. While jabbing, if you make contact with the enemy, hold the B button down and press the Control Pad in the opposite direction for a powerful blow.

Diagonal-view stages:

Crouch: Hold the B button to crouch after an attack.

Mid-air Attack: During a jump, press the B button to attack, or tap the B button rapidly to extend your jumping distance.

Jab: Press the Control Pad in the direction of the enemy and press the B but-ton to jab attack. After the jab attack, you can hold the B button down and press the Control Pad in the opposite direction for a powerful blow.

Jab and Toss: During the jab attack, once you make contact, you can hold down the B button and rotate the Control Pad to swing the enemy in a circle. Release the B button and the garbage goon will go flying to that great dumping the sky.

Hints: 

Password for the Last Level
At the password screen enter - Bottle, Tire, Can, Can 

The items you've collected throughout a level are carried over the next; thus, even though you can play the first four stages in any order, it's preferable to start with the easiest (or the one which gives you the most items), as you'll build your power for the toughest areas. The walkthrough below addresses this issue.

When fighting an enemy whose attacks are bombs, blasts, etc., primarily use jabs (press the control pad towards the enemy + B), since their range is more considerable than that of straight-ahead blows (done by pressing B without touching the control pad). 

Instead of running as fast as you can to complete the "slower" stages of the game, always look out for what might fall in front of you.

While fighting bosses, always keep an eye not only on your own life gauge, but also on the bosses'; if you have a lot more energy than he/she does, keep attacking him/her even though you're vulnerable to his/her counter-attacks. If you only have one or two life points left, use a life-regenerating item by pressing SELECT. But if you fight a boss and see that you have no chance of defeating him/her (assuming you have more than one life), don't use life- regenerating items and spare them for your next try.

    <desc>Zombie Hunter, which was once slated to be released in the US as Zombie Master, is a scrolling hack and slash adventure. It's like Zelda II in a way, except Link has a shield that he can actually use, instead of just adding to his total defense rating like in Zombie Hunter. Having a functional shield would've made this game a LOT more tolerable, I imagine. Anyways you walk to the right and slash at various foes that appear. Eventually you get enough experience to level up, and you also get gold sometimes, and items even less of the time. Like, you can get Food that (thank God) restores your HP, or maybe you'll get more powerful weapons or equipment, or maybe the key that unlocks the last door that lets you finish the level. The enemies don't seem to do any damage by themselves (you can jump on them for much amusement), but they can all fire projectiles that hurt quite a bit. Why your shield is, again, useless for deflecting projectiles, is just a bit annoying.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated except for that voice that chastises you whenever you die. Which happens a lot. Yeah, the game has synthesized voices in a couple places. It's pretty kewl.

1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.

--From the NES Zombie Nation instruction manual.

Controls:

A Button Nothing
B Button Shoot
Start Button Pause
Select Button Change Difficulty on map screen
Hints:

Hints:

-Instant Healing
When paused, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A
