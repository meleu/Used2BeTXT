    <desc>3 Ninjas Kick Back is a platforming game developed by Malibu Interactive and published by Sony Imagesoft in 1994 for the SNES and Sega Genesis (ported by Psygnosis) exclusively in the US to tie in with the 1994 film of the same name. It was bundled with Hook in the 3 Ninjas Kick Back / Hook compilation for the Sega Mega CD.

You play as one of the three main characters in the film. Your goal regardless of which character you choose is to assist an old samurai in retrieving a prized dagger from an old rival. To do so, you must complete a series of levels, each requiring you to complete a certain task (sometimes with a time limit) before continuing.</desc>

    <desc>Greetings, terror-trainees! Ickis, Krumm, and Oblina will have to prove themselves on the Monster midterm exams if they want to call themselves real monsters! They must work together as a team to receive a single gruesome grade on their frightful performance. So...go out and petrify someone!

I know what you're thinking, "A game based on a Nickelodeon cartoon, not good." But you'd be wrong, it's actually not that bad. You can switch between the monsters you control (3 in total), and with each monster you get a different group move, giving advantages such as high jumping and looking ahead.

There was a lot of detail put into these levels, such as broken up pieces of stereos, televisions and God knows what, appearing anyway and everywhere.

The music is very simple, boring and repetitive. However it's very quiet compared to most games, so I'm guessing they knew it was bad and turned down the volume for our benefit. How nice of them!

Directions:

The main objective here is to collect an item that the teacher of your monster academy wants you to find. However, it's really just a simple start-to-finish platformer with a boss at the end. 

There are other items other than the main goal item that you can collect, most that you'd find at a real dump, e.g. open tin cans, broken records, discarded flowers. When you collect these items, the number next to the fish bones will increase. This is for how many times you get to use one of the monsters' specials (see controls for specials). You also get the standard every game power-ups, 1-ups, and health power-ups.

The boss battles are nothing special, just watch how they move, jump over them/run under them, and chuck something.

There are various things to hurt you as you travel through the dump: cats, maggots, sewer pipes, etc. You have a life gauge in the shape of a heart in the top left corner, when that depletes you're dead and you go back to the start of the level or an un-marked checkpoint.

To fend off enemies and bosses, you have 2 main weapons that you can use: throwing trash, and scaring your enemies to make them run away. Scaring them is the limited weapon and trash is unlimited, how that's possible I do not know.

There are various differences with being each monster: for example, if there is a low ceiling of spikes, you can only pass under it safely with a short monster and not the tall one. However, the other main difference is the special moves (I don't know the monsters' names, so bear with me). With the tall candy cane-like monster, you can either get your other monsters to use her as a ladder, or, if you are near a wall, you can boost yourself up onto a ledge. The short fat one with his eyes in his hands can throw his eyes onto another part of the level so that you can see ahead, obviously they were trying to put some strategy into this otherwise easy game. Lastly, the shortest one will throw you ahead if, say, there is a large gap that you cannot jump. 

Controls:

A Button: Scare
B Button: Throw trash
C Button: Jump
Down+A: Switch Character
Up+A: Special move

The game would be followed by Addams Family Values, though this is a top-down game rather than a sidescroller.</desc>

    <desc>The evil Debbie Jelinksi is harming the Addams family once again... She has kidnapped Baby Pubert, and Uncle Fester is the one who must find him and to bring him back to his loving family.

"Addams Family Values" is an action adventure game with slight RPG elements (you gain more hit points while proceeding in the game, can upgrade your equipment and special attacks). You control Fester, by moving him around, fighting regular enemies and bosses, talking to members of Addams household, and occasionally solving puzzles. The combat is pure action, Zelda-style.

    <desc>D&amp;D Warriors of the Eternal Sun is an excellent game. Unlike most of the D&amp;D games on the early platforms, this game was a lot of fun to play and fairly easy to control. Round based combat with the option to move your character as well as decide what action to take was a stroke of genius. It gave us D&amp;D players a flashback to playing for real. It also used the same D&amp;D rules we are used to. The graphics were pleasing to the eye and the sounds were wonderful. The score for this game was one of the best I've heard. It really made you want to go out and adventure. There were also a lot of secrets to find with great rewards like magic items and weapons. The map isn't too big, but there is still a lot of game-play to be had. I think you will find yourself walking the length of the map a good many times. D&amp;D Warriors of the Eternal Sun is a great RPG. If you like D&amp;D, or if you are just a fan of all RPG's, give this game a try!

Directions:

Save the kingdom from complete madness and find some allies in this strange new world. 

Controls: 

A Button: Cancel

Hints:

Easy Experience
Go to any one of the caves and when you get inside kill the monsters there. After you've done that, go outside and come back in. The same monsters will be in the same spots for you to kill again. Do this as long as you like.

Advanced Busterhawk Gley Lancer, commonly known as Gleylancer, is a 1992 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up by NCS released exclusively in Japan (despite having some of its text, such as in the Mover configuration screen described below, in near-perfect English). It was released internationally on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008. Despite the English configuration screen, translation group M.I.J.E.T. released a patch which translated the story text in 2006-2007.

Lucia is the 16-year-old daughter of a fighter pilot who disappears while fighting a war between humans and aliens in 2025. He was captured by aliens whom he had captured earlier who had the ability to teleport. Lucia hijacks the prototype fighter CSH-01-XA "Gley Lancer" to save him.</desc>

Bleh! If you've played one Daisenryaku game, you've played them all I think. This one certainly has a lot more going for it in terms of presentation, that's for sure. Unfortunately, my ineptitude at console wargames is made painfully obvious once again. When you can't win at Fall Weiss, you know you suck.

Translation Description

This patch translates all the dialogue and all briefings completely into English. All that's left are some splash screens, but this patch is marked final, so these apparently won't get translated.

    <desc>This is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel. The game plays out much like an episode of the show. The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum. Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

So, Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls. Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show.

    <desc>Aero the Acro-Bat 2 is the sequel to Aero the Acro-Bat, and was released for the Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo in 1994. The SNES version was released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2010. Like its prequel, the game follows the adventures of Aero, a bat tasked with saving the world from Edgar Ektor.

There are several improvements over the original game, such as more moves, cutscenes that progress the game's story in between each world, and a password system that allows progress in the game to be saved.

The story starts directly after the events of the original game, where Aero had knocked Edgar Ektor off of a tower. After knocking him off, Aero leaves to explore Ektor's museum, finding a mirror which brings him to an ancient castle. Meanwhile, Ektor's henchman Zero manages to save him before he hits the ground, and tells Zero to prepare a 'Plan B'.</desc>

    <desc>Aero the Acro-Bat is a platform game developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Sunsoft for the Sega Mega Drive and SNES in 1993, with a port for the Game Boy Advance released in 2002. In 2010, the SNES version was made available on the Wii's Virtual Console service. In the game you play as the bat Aero, who needs to stop the mad scientist Edgar Ektor who is trying to rid the world of amusement and fun.

The game features 4 worlds, The Circus, The Funpark, The Woods, and the Museum. All worlds except for The Woods have 5 acts and a boss act. Most acts require the player to accomplish a certain goal before finding the exit, such as falling through a number of magic hoops or rescuing a captured circus performer, although a few only require Aero to find the exit before advancing to the next act. It is another '90's platformer trying to latch on to the popularity of Sonic or Mario.

The game was reasonably successful, and therefore saw a sequel, Aero the Acro-Bat 2.</desc>

The game is essentially the same as its prequel, however now features a throttle control which allows the player to adjust his/her speed during gameplay. There are also three new stages, bringing the total to 21 and various gameplay and music tweaks.

Whereas the original After Burner saw ports to simpler video game consoles/computers such as the Sega Master System, After Burner II was ported to more advanced 16-bit systems including the Sega Mega Drive, J2ME, and TurboGrafx-16. After Burner II also saw release as part of the Sega Ages: Volume 1 compilation on the Sega Saturn, and is playable within Shenmue II.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Up until the movie Aladdin was released, the licensing rights for adapting Disney characters into video games were handled separately for the Sega and the Nintendo consoles: Sega released some games featuring Disney characters (like Castle of Illusion, or Quackshot) but didn't adapt any movies or series. Meanwhile, Capcom adapted exactly those series and movies for their rival Nintendo, exclusively. This changed in 1993, when Virgin was allowed to create a game based on the movie Aladdin, which was critically praised. Capcom, however, still held the rights to do an adaptation on their own. So the Genesis and the Super Nintendo saw both their own version of Disney's Aladdin, both based on the same movie but produced by different companies. Later Disney adaptations would be handled by Virgin for both consoles following the release of The Lion King in 1994.

So this Aladdin II is not a game based on the TV series or some sort of sequel, but rather a retelling of the same story. Other than using the same story, however, the two games are different in almost every regard. So, keeping above in mind, it's quite understandable why the people responsible for porting the Super Nintendo game to Sega's 16-bitter would opt to call the game Aladdin II. It is, in fact, the second Aladdin game on that console. And as far as ports go, this one actually is pretty accurate.

The game mechanics have remained the same as they did in the Super Nintendo original: Aladdin can throw apples (which he can collect throughout the levels) to stun enemies or dispatch smaller foes. Enemies are generally defeated by jumping on them. Bosses can take several hits. The programmers managed to get the game controls down pretty well, although they occasionally seem a bit sluggish. Also, the collision detection seems to be a bit off, but it's bearable, albeit irritating at times. However, in order to fit the game on a 16-Meg cartridge, the porters have decided to make some changes.

The first noticeable one would be the new title screen  although this has probably just been done in order to remove all copyright notices referring to Capcom or Nintendo. More importantly, however, is that the programmers have removed quite a number of sprites. The snipped a few frames out a few characters animations, which leads to some jerky movement. This becomes particularly apparent during boss battles. The first boss hardly seems animated at all whenever he strikes with his sword, and the last battles against Jafar require play totally different since the attack patterns have changed (for example the moving floor has been removed out of the very last boss battle). Some minor character sprites  like one-time foes, or background sprites like Apu, the walking animations of the magic carpet, or the appearance of Jasmin at the end of level one have been cut entirely.

Some changes do influence the gameplay a bit, however. The password option has been entirely cut out of the game, so you have to play through it in one sitting. Further, the SNES version had a Scarab in most of the levels, which served as a mid-level save point. The omission of these Scarabs means that there are no save points either. To offset this, (and in some cases because the programmers didn't manage to pull off a fluent change in the stages background) the porters have decided to cut some levels into smaller stages. Also, where you originally could find a Scarab you now get an additional heart to your life bar. Two levels, which were very dependant on one-time only sprites, have also been cut entirely (Inside the lamp, stage three and the magic carpet ride bonus stage). So, once you master the somewhat jerky controls, the game becomes easier than it originally was overall. 

The port had to take big hits in the sounds and graphics departments. For all the twenty+ levels, there are only three different background tracks in the Genesis version, and I'm positive that I've heard at least one of those in another pirated game (Donkey Kong '99, to be exact!). This music quite often doesn't fit the mood of the stages. For example, a stage with a fiery cave that included fireballs and lava ended up having soothing, slow muzak. Also, contrary to the SNES version, there unfortunately is no multi-layered background scrolling. Last but not least, while the porters did take the background graphics directly from the original game, they somewhat suffered during the port, leading to some ugly artifacts and pixels in the background graphics (as you can see for yourself in these screen shots).

Overall, however, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with this port. It's very close to the original and plays pretty well! Definitely an effort well made (for a hack, anyway).

    <desc>Aladdin is a platform game developed by Virgin Interactive in 1993. It is based on Disney's movie of the same name and was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Amiga, DOS, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and NES. An entirely different game was developed by Sims for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, and another version developed by Capcom exists for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy Advance, as Capcom still held the rights to develop Disney-themed games for Nintendo consoles.

Virgin's version of the game was seen as a milestone for the industry, as all the animations were drawn by Disney artists frame by frame. It meant that Aladdin looked significantly better than most other platformers on the market, and was able to provide gamers with the same graphical style as seen in the film. Many of Aladdin's developers would move on to form Shiny Entertainment, and produce Earthworm Jim.</desc>

    <desc>Alien Soldier is a Mega Drive game developed by Treasure and published by Sega in 1995. It was one of the few Mega Drive games to be released in Japan and Europe, but not North America (however it was made available briefly through the Sega Channel service), and is now considered an extremely rare collectors item. It has since been re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console service, as well as being released as part of the Sega Ages Treasure Box disc for the PlayStation 2.</desc>

    <desc>Alien Storm is a 1990 beat 'em up game released by Sega for Sega System 18 hardware.

When aliens invade earth, it's up to a special forces team known as the "Alien Busters," to get rid of them. The player can play as either Karen, Garth or Scooter and must defeat all the on-screen aliens. The game is very similar to Sega's earlier title, Golden Axe, aside from the futuristic setting and occasional bonus rounds.

Alien Storm was ported to a variety of platforms, including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and ZX Spectrum, most of which being released in 1991. The Mega Drive version of the game was released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007/2008, and was also bundled as part of Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection for the Sony PlayStation 3/Xbox 360. In the Master System version of the game the robot is named "Slammer" and Karen is completely missing. Some versions also call Garth "Gordon".</desc>

Japan: Alisia is the daughter of a sorcerer killed by evil Baldour's followers after her father banished Baldour in a cocoon to outer space, which has since crashed back to Earth, leaving Alisia to defeat Baldour and his followers.

US/EU: Alisia is a female adventurer who is the only one who can destroy the evil delivered by a silver star that has returned to Earth (implied that Earth had managed to deal with it once before).</desc>

    <desc>Altered Beast, called Juuouki in Japan, is a Sega System 16 arcade game released in 1988 by Sega. It was developed by the creator of Golden Axe, Makoto Uchida and shares many graphical similarities as a result. The game was notable as it allows the player could take on the form of "Were Animals".

A year later it was ported to various consoles, including the Sega Mega Drive, which it was bundled with during the console's early years. There was a watered down port for the Sega Master System also, and several ports to non-Sega systems, including console rivals the NES and Turbografx-16.</desc>

    <desc>Arcade Classics is a compilation of three arcade games originally released by Atari during the 1970s and early 1980s. The compilation was released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1996.

As well as providing "classic" versions of the games, there are also enhanced "Sega" versions, which update the graphics. Sadly the games are plagued by framerate issues, slowing down considerably when numerous objects are on screen.

Sega wanted three Atari classics converted to the Genesis with as much integrity as possible. Therefore, the games used in the compilation were based directly off Atari code. The Atari 7800 version of Centipede and Atari 2600 version of Missile Command were converted from the original 6502 assembly language code to the Z80 for the Game Gear version and then from Z80 to the 68000 for the Mega Drive. While all the code specifically associated with sound and graphics had to be re-written, the initial conversions were done using the developer's own 6502 to Z80 and Z80 to 68000 assembly language converters. Pong, a hard-wired console game which was reverse engineered for the Game Gear, was initially converted from the Game Gear to the Genesis using a Z80 to 68000 assembly language converter. The video and sound modules were then rewritten to complete the process.</desc>

It is the only game in Wolf Team's Arcus series of RPGs to receive an international release and the first entry to see release on a Sega system (a compilation of the first three games, which were only released on Japanese computers, was released on the Sega CD in Japan in 1993).

The sorceress Castomira set out to destroy the world, and has managed to defeat all but one of the warriors who have attempted to stop her. That lone soul was Princess Leaty, who engaged in a fierce, destructive magical duel with Castomira that lasted for days, ending with Leaty sealing Castomira in the Dark World using a sword which came to be known as The Power of Leaty. Centuries later, Castomira's followers have stolen The Power of Leaty and plan to return Castomira for the ultimate destruction.</desc>

    <desc>Art of Fighting, known as Ryuuko no Ken in Japan (and South Korea), is a fighting game by SNK, originally released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade and AES home console in 1992. It was ported, among other consoles, to the Sega Mega Drive in 1994. It is the second fighting game to be developed by SNK - a genre they would later be known for, following Fatal Fury (which co-exists in the same fictional universe).

As with Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting took several huge hits when it was brought to the inferior Mega Drive hardware, most notably the Neo Geo's camera, which would zoom in on the players if they were close together. It is also considered to have inferior graphics and sound when compared to its Neo Geo counterpart, but like all SNK games brought to Mega Drive hardware, was still considered at a better deal (as Neo Geo games retailed at $200 new).

No other Art of Fighting games were released for Sega consoles, however most of the characters in Art of Fighting also appear in the The King of Fighters series, which saw many releases on Sega consoles.</desc>

    <desc>Asterix and the Great Rescue is a platforming game developed by Core Design and published by Sega and released in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in the US and Europe. It was the first Sega game to tie into the Asterix series of comic books and other media. A different such game was released for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear.

Gaul is almost completely occupied by the Roman Empire; the only plot of land remaining is the small town where Asterix and his friend Obelix live. While the town has been able to stalemate the Romans in the surrounding areas until then, the Romans did capture and imprison the town druid, Getafix, and their pet Dogmatix in Rome, and the two main characters must now set off to Rome to free them.</desc>

    <desc>Awesome Possum Kicks Dr. Machino's Butt! is a platform game released by Tengen in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive video game console. Inspired heavily by Sonic the Hedgehog and possibly Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, it features a possum named Awesome who must defeat the evil Dr. Machino and his army of robots.

The game has a strong environmental message, involving the destruction of rainforests and pollution. At the end of each stage the user is asked questions relating to the environment or the animal kingdom.

Awesome Possum was not released outside of Japan and North America, and was heavily criticized upon release for having poor physics and controls. The character of Awesome also also provides a running commentary while playing, which was often cited as being annoying.</desc>

    <desc>Pro Moves Soccer is a great game that just about every soccer fan should enjoy, thanks to the simple controls and the ability to make your own team. Despite the cheesy voices, the rest of the game puts that offside and makes it into an otherwise great game!

The graphics are well drawn for a Genesis game, even if animation is somewhat stiff. You see players performing sliding tackles, head shots, rainbow kicks, and even getting taken down. Referees call players over and hold up the corresponding card that they have been issued. You even get a close up shot of penalty kicks. If a player goes down hard, he may need medical attention, at which the medics will arrive on the field to treat him.

A high, scratchy male's voice calls out what goes on, such as the kickoff, offside, fouls, cards, and penalties. Fortunately, you can turn him off. The crowd doesn't make much noise unless there's a shot on someone's goal. The menu music is alright, but it could be better. Even then, you'll still enjoy the game even if you must turn the sound off.

A six button control pad is recommended, but a three button will work too, just you need to pull off two button combos for some functions. Either way, the players move smoothly, and you can pull off things like speed bursts, sliding tackles, elbows/holding, rainbow kicks, headers, passes, shots, GOALS! (OK, so that last one has to be done with some skill and luck involved!

    <desc>Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II or simply Super Monaco GP II is a racing game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1992. It is a sequel to Super Monaco GP, but this time the game is sponsored by Ayrton Senna (who won the Monaco Grand Prix six times). Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer.

At the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular. However, due to these celebrity endorsements, it is unlikely Super Monaco GP II will be re-released without cutbacks.</desc>

    <desc>The plot is very basic. One day, young Baby Bink is kidnapped from his rich parents by clumsy kidnappers hoping for some extra cash if they return the baby to his parents. Well, the baby craws away from the kidnappers, and he goes off into the city, exploring. While he is exploring around the city, it is your job to make sure that he does not get run over by a car, stepped on, etc. You also have to help Baby Bink find his way back to the arms of his mother.

    <desc>
Back to the Future Part III, often simply known as Back to the Future III, is a video game released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System. It is based on the movie with the same name.

An error in the Mega Drive version's palette storage results in the game appearing darker than it actually should be. On the Genesis, the bit order of palette colors is 0000BBB0GGG0RRR0, with RRR, GGG, and BBB being the red/green/blue components of the color and 0 being zero bits. This game, however, uses 00000BBB0GGG0RRR by mistake; the lowest bits of the components are ignored by the hardware, resulting in a color range (000, 001, 010, 011). Because smaller values are darker, the colors will thus appear darker.</desc>

    <desc>Barbie Super Model is a 1993 game for several platforms including the Sega Mega Drive by Hi Tech Expressions tying into the Barbie toy franchise. A prototype ROM for a cancelled Sega Game Gear port also circulates on the Internet.

The goal of the game is to get Barbie around town (by car, on foot, etc.) to prepare outfits for her role as a runway model. At various points (or by collecting various items), you are told to make Barbie look like the picture of a magazine cover, which is made inaccessible to you (making each dress-up a memory game).</desc>

    <desc>Barbie travels all across the United States for her vacation, visiting states such as Wyoming and Florida. Along the way, she goes camping, throws horseshoes, plays volleyball, rides horses and does all of the usual teenage girl stuff. Puzzles are of the simple kind, such as arranging tent pieces or finding hidden presents.

Still, simple games can have better graphics and sound than this one does. The backgrounds look flat, but at least they're bright. The sounds are the usual kiddy game deal, with really... bouncy music, too.

Barbie's Vacation Adventure is a two player game with six different levels. For each activity, you only have to press one button. It is an incredibly easy game.

Barbie's Vacation Adventure is not worth checking out if you're over the age of 10. But, if your little sister needs something to keep her occupied, pick up Barbie's Vacation Adventure for $5.

Translation Description:

All the text in the game has been translated. This includes both dialogue in the story mode and the win/lose quotes in the Battle mode, and the Engrish in the battle mode has been fixed. The patch has been thoroughly tested and works on the hardware. If you find a platform it doesn't work on, contact the author.

There are currently no known bugs. Please note, however, that the patch has only been tested on an American Sega Genesis Model 2. The code has been written in such a way that it should work on all models, though.

    <desc>Barney's Hide &amp; Seek Game is a game that was released in 1993 by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis video game system. It is based on the children's television and home video franchise known as the "Barney" franchise. The voice of Barney was recorded by Bob West, who also performed the "Barney" role on the television show. There are more than one hundred words and two hundred phrases spoken by Barney the Dinosaur. Favorite things are always mentioned by name by Barney when the player helps him discover them. Educational concepts taught in this game include counting, matching, and problem solving. There is a self-play feature that guides the player to the objective when he or she isn't playing. Strangely, despite being an educational game aimed towards pre-school children, this title is not part of the Sega Club series.</desc>

    <desc>Batman Forever is a Batman game developed by Probe and published by Acclaim for the Sega Mega Drive. It is based on the 1995 movie of the same name. It should not be confused with the Game Gear version, which is entirely different, nor Batman Forever: The Arcade Game which is also based on this movie.

Unlike previous entries in the series, Batman Forever uses digitised 3D graphics, similar to Mortal Kombat.</desc>

    <desc>The year is 2049. An alien armada assaults the Solar System. You are a nameless hero whose mission is to board the enemy's main battle cruiser and to disable all sixteen of its main plasma nodes. A special Battle Frenzy chip (code name Bloodshot) is implanted into your neural net, making you the one ultimate soldier on whom the entire humanity depends now.

This is a 3D first-person shooter. You move through maze-like corridors of the alien ship, getting weapons and items, and blasting everything you encounter on your way. There is also a two players mode with split screens.

Trivia:

On the publishing section of Good Deal Games, you can read that the Sega CD version is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sega Enterprises Limited, Domark, or Time-Warner Interactive, who were all involved with the original development.

Battle Mania Daiginjou is the sequel to the game we got stateside known as Trouble Shooter, and, like all good things in the video game world, it was left in Japan. Looks fun though.

Overview:

Two mercenary ladies with a need for destruction. The premise is not of the usual kind of shooter. But the rest is fairly common to all of us: containers with power-ups, flashing shots and a gigantic enemy army.

Typical and reasonably challenging shooter action with some quick puzzles around on certain stages to break the ice. The gamer (playing the role of the mercenary Mania Ohtori, also known as ''Madison'') has the partnership of Maria ''Crystal'' Waneda (whom is equipped with a heavy bazooka) and a weapon pod (which the gamer selects amongst four different types and each one is capable of a devastating attack when activated at a full charge weapon bar). The funny and strange elements of the game, such as the little lab hamster - and others that the gamer will find while delving further into the game, frenetic action and ausence of slomo are its gameplay's greatest assets.

Translation Description:

From MIJET's site:

"In what has become a MIJET trademark, this is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English. However, it goes far beyond simply supporting both English and the original Japanese; it contains two different English translations and a selection of three English fonts.

This patch is contained within two different IPS files, but the only differences between the two are the default script and font to use if none are selected by the user. That's correct; it is possible to select the desired script and font by holding down certain combinations of buttons prior to the Sega logo appearing. See the included documentation for more details."

They even fixed some bugs that were in the original. How 'bout those guys, huh? PLAY THE GAME. :D

    <desc>Noah's Ark

God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt. So God asked Noah to make an ark of cypress wood and bring into the ark two of every living thing of all flesh; they shall be male and female. Help Noah gather animals and food for his long journey before the flood arrives.

Save Baby Moses

The Pharaoh of Egypt has given orders to his soldiers to cast every male baby born to the Hebrews into the Nile River. A daughter of the house of Levi has given birth to a goodly son. Baby Moses is doomed unless you safely carry him to the weeds at the river's edge. There baby Moses will be placed into a little ark made of bulrushes and pitch.

David and Goliath

Young David is in charge of his family's sheep. After finding all the sheep and carrying them to safety, David faces his greatest challenge. Armed only with his sling and stones, David must defeat Goliath, the giant champion of the Philistine army, and save the nation of Israel.

--From the Genesis Bible Adventures instruction manual.

Overview:

Before getting into the game, let me give you a bit of a background on the game's company, Wisdom Tree. A Christian video game company, Wisdom Tree made religious games for the NES, SNES, Genesis, PC, and a couple of others. But the games made were unauthorized and without any kind of permission from either Nintendo, Sega, or what have you. These games were reportedly sold in Christian bookstores rather than video game retail outlets. Many of Wisdom Tree's games were criticized, though, for being dangerously similar to more well known games like Super Mario, Zelda, and Wolfenstein 3D.

Bible Adventures, originally released on the NES in 1991, had been ported to the Sega Genesis in 1995 to the create the game here, giving it new music and updated graphics. The gameplay is drastically similar to the classic Super Mario Bros 2. in that you pick things up over your head and carry them, as well as just the layout being similar. However, this game isn't as easy to control, and using the character you want can often feel slippery. The sound leaves a bit to be desired, too, the music not being all that memorable, and it might annoy you more than anything. If you're into something different from what major game companies authorize, or a pretty big Christian, you can give this a go, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

Directions:

Bible Adventures consists of three different games for you to play: Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath. Here is how you play each of them: 

Noah's Ark: In this game, you play as Noah and your goal is round up two of each type of animal: cows, horses, monkeys, snakes, pigs, and oxen. When you retrieve the animals, you must bring them back to the middle where the ark is, and drop them in (press Up to do so). Some animals you can just walk up to and pick them up with ease, but sometimes you need more effort and this results in you knocking them out with what appears to be a honeycomb. If you somehow find yourself low on health, you can read the Bible verses scattered about the levels to help give yourself more health. Your Inventory will tell you which animals you still need to find and which ones you already have. Be aware that the snakes you are trying to catch are not the same as the ones in the trees that try to kill you. There are several stages to this game, each with a different list of animals to find.

Baby Moses: The Pharoah has ordered that all male Hebrew children are to be killed, but with you as the role of Jochebed, you must get your son, Moses, through the level unharmed. To do this, you have to carry Moses over your head in the same way you would the animals in Noah's Ark. However, you must avoid the hunters, for they can attack you as well as capture Moses. Keep this in mind, though: you can complete the game without bringing Moses with you.

David and Goliath: With you taking the role of David, your goal in the beginning is to capture sheep, again in the same way by lifting them over your head, and bringing them to the pen. However, different animals such as lions and bears will come after you, so you may have to dodge them to avoid being struck. After you complete this portion, you must scale a mountain, all the while dodging guards and creatures as well as tumbling rocks. The last part of the game consists of you in a showdown between both the shield-bearer of Goliath as well as Goliath himself. 

Noah's Ark: In this game, you play as Noah and your goal is round up two of each type of animal: cows, horses, monkeys, snakes, pigs, and oxen. When you retrieve the animals, you must bring them back to the middle where the ark is, and drop them in (press Up to do so). Some animals you can just walk up to and pick them up with ease, but sometimes you need more effort and this results in you knocking them out with what appears to be a honeycomb. If you somehow find yourself low on health, you can read the Bible verses scattered about the levels to help give yourself more health.

    <desc>Bio-Hazard Battle, called Crying: Aseimei Sensou or simply Crying in Japan, is a 1992 shoot-'em-up game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive.

The planet Avaron was plunged into deep biological war, and a retrovirus was synthesized to try to defeat the enemy. Unfortunately, the plan backfires: the planet is rendered nearly inhospitable, and the only survivors of the virus are sent to space to await a time when the new species of creatures that survive or thrive on the virus pose little enough a threat to set up a new colony.</desc>

    <desc>Uchuu Senkan Gomora, is a shoot-em-up by UPL, originally released in 1990 for the arcade, and then ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. While the arcade version was released overseas (in the US under license from American Sammy under the name Bio-Ship Paladin), the MD version was only released in Japan - however an American title screen is present in the ROM and displayable if the region is set to US, which may mean a US release was planned (this is unconfirmed). It is UPL's only Mega Drive game - they would go bankrupt shortly after publishing it (the later Task Force Harrier EX was ported and published by Treco).</desc>

Blaster Master 2 is a direct sequel to the NES game Blaster Master. It was released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993, only in North America.

Blaster Master 2 was handled by a team at Software Creations, rather than internally at Sunsoft like its prequel. The Japanese arm of Sunsoft had at this point tossed aside the Blaster Master franchise due to sluggish sales in Japan, however the game sold very well in North America and so a western-developed sequel was put into production. As such, the original team were initially unaware of Blaster Master 2's existence.

Blaster Master 2 was not manufactured in large numbers, and is now considered to be one of the more valuable Mega Drive games.</desc>

    <desc>Blockout is a puzzle game developed by California Dreams and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. It has also been released for other consoles and computers.

The game can be seen almost as "3D Tetris". The game has a top-down perspective, with the primary objective being to clear "floors" rather than lines. Like Tetris, the player is given a series of shapes made up of cubes, which can be rotated on all three axes. Also like Tetris, if the player's pieces reach the top of the screen (i.e. some floors have gaps in them), the player will lose.

The formula behind Blockout has been recycled and rebranded numerous times, just like Tetris.</desc>

    <desc>Bonanza Bros. is a 1990 arcade game developed by Sega for the Sega System 24 arcade platform.

In the game the player either controls Robo (red) or Mobo (blue), two thieves who must retrieve several objects scattered around levels while avoiding guards in a stealth-like fashion. Each player is armed with a firearm which can stun the guards for a short period of time, but it is also possible to hinder the guards' progress by using various parts of the scenery. It is a two-player game, and the screen is always split horizontally.

Bonanza Bros. was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Master System and Sega Mega Drive in the coming years. TurboGrafx-CD and Sharp X68000 ports also existed exclusively in Japan, and Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum ports were released in Europe. Some westernised versions of the game call Robo and Mobo "Mike" and "Spike" respectively. Likewise North American and Brazilian copies of the game refer to the game as Bonanza Brothers rather than Bonanza Bros..
More recently, Bonanza Bros. was made available through the Wii's Virtual Console service, as well as being made part of the Sega Classics Collection and Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection compilations. As well as this, the game was unlockable within the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection, but was strangely removed from western releases of the game. It has also been ported to various mobile phones by SoftBank Mobile.

The arcade version of Bonanza Bros. was also included in volume 6 of the Sega Ages 2500 PlayStation 2 series. It is bundled with Puzzle &amp; Action: Tant-R and its sequel, Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R, both of which use a similar graphical style (as does Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt, which was not included).

The Bonanza Bros. (Robo and Mobo) are playable characters in Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing.</desc>

    <desc>Boxing Legends of the Ring lets you take control of eight middleweight legends of boxing, Roberto Duran, Tommy "Hitman" Duran, Jake "Raging Bull" La Motta, Rocky Graziano, "Sugar" Ray Robinson, "Sugar" Ray Leonard, "Marveleous" Marvin Hagler and James Toney. You can either compete in an exhibition mode or play in career mode and become the greatest of all time.

The set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow. Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.

There are two main displays during a fight, a damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing gloves, one on each side and as a player connects a punch, the glove will show a black area of where the glove connected and a damage meter that show's the two fighters faces. As the round progresses, the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and is the best time to land your super punch.

Another feature is from round to round, your view will alternate, from looking over your shoulder to the next round and looking at yourself over your opponents shoulder.

    <desc>
Just in time before the years end, the English translation of the Taiwanese unlicensed RPG Barver Battle Saga for the Sega Genesis is finally released! Lots of work has gone into this project, and I hope everyone will enjoy it.

Be sure to check the read me for more about the game, who did what, and all the work that went into getting this game into English :)

About the Game:

Released in 1996 in Taiwan as Barver Battle Saga - Tai Kong Zhan Shi - Mo Fa Zhan Shi, by ChuanPu Technology. The main title, Tai Kong Zhan Shi (literally translated as Space Warrior) is what Final Fantasy is called in Taiwan, a clear attempt the makers made in order to catch peoples attention. After all, Final Fantasy on the Genesis sounds pretty nice :) 

The game was later pirated in Russia under the name Final Fantasy. Unfortunately the company who produced that version were apparently not well versed in Russian, as the resulting translation is notoriously bad, possibly indicating an  automatic translator was used. While making a translation of the Russian version maight have been a much simpler task than its Taiwanese original, due to how horrible the Russian was it just wouldn't have been possible. 

Like many unlicensed Taiwanese Megadrive games, the game uses a lot of copied content from other games, among other things numerous graphics, or "inspriration", from Seiken Densetsu 3 and Romancing Saga 3 for the SNES. The sound engine is also assumingly stolen directly from Data East's High Seas Havoc, the biggest giveaway being that engines trademark organ sound. This same sound engine is actually used in quite a few other Taiwanese originals :) The game engine itself also is reused in other unlicensed titles. 

About the Patch:

This is a 100% translation from Chinese to English. The whole game has gone through a huge process to get where it is now, including in order:

-Disassembly and reassembly of the WHOLE game code  

-Insertion of 3 new fonts. One for dialogs and menus, a smaller one for  

items and magic, and a separate one for the intro text. 

-Completely working new VWF  

-Code modifications of the dialog, intro, shops, inns and battle text routines  

-Modified text windows  

-Modified Z80 code  

-Insertion of new title screen

    <desc>Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind is a Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo platform game released by Accolade in 1993. It is the first in the Bubsy the Bobcat series, and was released at the height of the "mascot wars" in which company mascots like Mario and Sonic were starring in popular video games. Bubsy was created by Michael Berlyn, and during production was hyped up to be "the next Sonic the Hedgehog" only to receive mixed reviews from critics. It did, however, spawn a number of sequels including Bubsy II, and a pilot was made for a cartoon series featuring the character.
In Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind there are fifteen levels in which Bubsy must defeat the evil Woolies who have stolen balls of yarn.</desc>

    <desc>Caliber.50 is a top-down run and gun video game originally released in arcades (as Cal.50) before being brought to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. The Mega Drive version was only released in North America.
The Mega Drive version is severely watered down from the arcade original, not just in terms of graphics and sound, but also gameplay, as the controls need to be mapped to three buttons.</desc>

Castlevania: Bloodlines, known as Vampire Killer in Japan, is an entry in the Castlevania series, and the first of two games to reach Sega systems. Bloodlines was the subject of much debate at the time, as even though it has a considerable amount of violence and many depictions of blood, Sega's Videogame Rating Council only gave the game a "GA", the lowest rating possible. This affected the European release, which was heavily censored and renamed Castlevania: The New Generation, and the Australian release kept the name while remaining identical to the American release in content. The game was released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive.

Bloodlines takes place in 1917 and does not feature the Belmont clan featured in previous games. It is also the first game not to take place exclusively within in Romania.</desc>

    <desc>Championship Pro-Am is a racing game developed by Rare Ltd. and published by Tradewest on the Sega Mega Drive. It is a remake of R.C. Pro-Am, a game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. R.C. Pro-Am was a popular title in its day and spawned sequels on the Nintendo Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System.

Graphics and music are somewhat improved. The letters that can be collected within a level spell out "CHAMPION", rather than "NINTENDO". Spelling out "CHAMPION" a third and fourth time will earn superchargers that increase speed from 104 MPH to 108 MPH and 110 MPH. Players enter their initials at the beginning of the game, not the end. There are five opponents instead of three. Cars under the effect of the roll cage power-up cannot be destroyed by missiles or bombs. Dash Zones earn 100 times the points as the Nintendo versions. There are lap records for each track and beating the record grants 500 points. Extra continues can be won every time five consecutive races are won.</desc>

    <desc>Chaos Engine 2 appeared in 1996 for AGA Amigas and 1 MB Amiga 500, with a rough beta version also in existence for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The game pits the player characters against each other as prisoners of Baron Fortesque, and is basically a competition game instead of a co-operation one. It was severely unfinished when released, due to the publisher rushing it out, and the game brought disappointment to many fans of the finely-honed first game. Little concrete information is found on the sequel, save for the page on the developers' website.

    <desc>Chase H.Q. II, known as Super H.Q. in Japan, is a sequel to Chase H.Q. and was developed and published by Taito for the Sega Mega Drive in 1992. It should not be confused with Special Criminal Investigation, which was also sometimes marked as "Chase H.Q. II".

Gameplay is very similar to the first game, with the major difference being a choice of three vehicles to chase criminals. By ramming the criminal's car enough times the car will be stopped and the criminal will be arrested. All of this needs to be done within a strict time limit, and while avoiding other cars and obstacles.</desc>

    <desc>Chiki Chiki Boys, also known as Mega Twins in some areas, is an arcade game by Capcom first released in 1990 and ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1992 by Sega and Visco. The game features two twins who are attempting to re-take control of their land, Alurea, after a monster unexpectedly attacks, destroying everything in its path. The people of Alurea have lived in peace for a thousand years and have forgotten how to fight, yet the land's only survivors, the twin sons of the king, must take up the challenge and return their kingdom to its former glory.

The two twins, aged around 15 at the time the game takes place, venture forth in search of a legendary stone known as "Dragon Blue Eyes," which is rumoured to be able to put everything back to rights.

The game is notable in the Sonic scene for its Mega Drive version; the Sonic 2 Simon Wai prototype contains some leftover graphics from the game once thought to be part of Sonic 2. The ROM is believed to have been dumped from a cart which originally had Chiki Chiki Boys before being overwritten with the Sonic 2 beta ROM.</desc>

    <desc>Chuck Rock is a platform game developed by Core Design and published by Virgin Interactive in 1991. It follows the adventure of a caveman named Chuck who must save Ophelia Rock from a tyrannosaurus rex called Garry Gritter.

The game was ported to a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Mega CD, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. The Mega CD version offers an enhanced soundtrack.

The sprite style and animation is cartoonish and gameplay filled with slapstick. Chuck can attack by thrusting his belly forward and hitting oncoming opponents. Another method of attack is by throwing rocks. Health is displayed in the HUD as a heart which shrinks with each hit taken. Health can be replenished by collecting dinsaur steaks found in levels. Some puzzle elements involve moving rocks to reach higher areas.

Chuck Rock was followed by Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck and BC Racers.</desc>

    <desc>ClayFighter, is a fighting game developed by Visual Concepts and published by Interplay in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. This game is a port from the Super Nintendo, with several gameplay changes taken from the updated SNES version, Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition. The game was most known for its colorful graphics, with each character rendered from clay to give the game its unique look.

The game features eight playable characters, battling each other to become the 'King of the Circus'. The one-player game has the selected character battle through several matches, including a few rematches against previously beaten opponents, before fighting the game's final enemy, N. Boss. Each character has a set of special moves performed with special button combinations. When a character receives heavy damage, the word 'KO!' will appear above them, if they are hit with a special move during this time, they will take extra damage.</desc>

    <desc>Columns III: Revenge of Columns, known as Columns III: Taiketsu! Columns World in Japan, is an entry in the Columns series of puzzle games developed by Sega in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive. It adds several new gameplay features, including new puzzle modes and up to five simultaneous players. The game was only released in Japan and the US, with VIC Tokai publishing it in the US (consequently, the incorrect myth that VIC Tokai also developed the game is very widespread). The game has been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service. Columns III most notably introduced the "Crush Bar," a competitive-play gambit which is now a staple feature of the Columns series appearing in every game since (each time with a different name).</desc>

    <desc>Columns is a puzzle game first created in 1989 by Jay Geertsen of Hewlett-Packard on the HP/UX with X Window System, with ports to DOS, Macintosh. Windows, and the Atari ST. In 1990, Geertsen sold the rights to Sega, where it was ported to the System C arcade board. This version was successful enough to be ported to various Sega and non-Sega hardware (including being both a Game Gear launch title and pack-in) and launched a series of sequels, that, despite bottomed-out popularity, continues to receive attention today.</desc>

    <desc>Comix Zone is a platform action game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Play involves defeating enemies with punches, kicks, and holds, managing your inventory, and solving puzzles.

The game's most remarkable feature is that it is set within the "panels" of a comic book. Each level consists of two "pages", and secrets are discovered by shredding the "paper" and revealing items. Dialogue is rendered within talk bubbles with the typical comic font. Sprites and backgrounds possess the bright colors and dynamic drawing style favored by superhero comics.

The plot concerns Sketch Turner, a cartoonist that during an unusual thunderstorm, becomes trapped in his own comic book while Mortus, the villain of his story, is flung out of it. Inside the comic book, he meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he's a superhero that came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil. In the real world, Mortus would literally draw new villains on the pages of the comic book, trying to kill Sketch Turner, and so obtaining his "real" body to conquer the real world with. Sketch Turner would have to battle his way through the pages, his only help being his pet rat Roadkill, who got electrocuted during this thunderstorm, enabling him to zap enemies.

The game is hidden within the Japanese version of Sonic Mega Collection and is locked part of all region versions of Sonic Mega Collection Plus, which is unlockable with having a Sonic Heroes gamesave, or is unlocked over time.

The original Genesis game came with a bonus music CD, which had vocal tracks of the 6 main tunes in the game. The music was performed by the band "Roadkill", which was lead by Howard Drossin.

Comix Zone was ported to the GBA and released in Europe in 2002.</desc>

    <desc>It's a hack, not a retranslation, although the script has been cleaned up. Lots of minor tweaks and things to make this my ideal version of the far superior USA release. There may even be some undocumented stuff I added&#x2026;

- Copyright screen edited slightly.
- Copyright screen can now be skipped by pressing the start button.
- Minor rewording in options menus.
- Maximum number of lives in options menu increased to 5 (default is still 3).
- Got rid of the annoying "press start to exit" feature in some menus.
- Start button can now be used to confirm some options.
- Start button can now be used to select your character.
- Mission briefings can now be skipped by pressing the start button.
- You can now hold buttons B &amp; C to skip through text faster.
- In-game font fixed such that lower-case characters are now usable.
- Added an alternate font (activated with a code).
- Added 'e accent aigu' for 'coup d'&#xE9;tat'.
- Script corrected, edited, and optimized.
- Soft reset added.

It is the only Contra installment on the Sega console aside from Contra: Legacy of War. The game is also notable for being one of the hardest games in the Contra franchise.

A parody of Simon Belmont, from the Castlevania series (also by Konami) is featured as an optional boss. He also has his respective theme, Simon1994RD, a remixed version of Vampire Killer.</desc>

    <desc>Cool Spot is a 1993 platform video game developed and published by Virgin Interactive staring the then mascot of 7-up, the 7-up spot. It is a sequel to Spot: The Video Game, a puzzle game similar to Ataxx initially released on the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Cool Spot was developed with the Sega Mega Drive in mind, and due to its success was ported to other platforms, including the Amiga, DOS computers, Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Sega Master System and SNES.

The PAL version of the game removes the 7-up branding on the bottle in the opening.

In some in-game text (particularly copyright info), the game is referred to as "Spot: The Quest For Cool".
The game is notable for making -no- use of Boss Battles, an otherwise expected gameplay feature.
The music in the game was composed by Tommy Tallarico, who also composed composed work for such titles as Earthworm Jim and Spider-Man and the X-Men: Arcade's Revenge.

The game was followed by the isometric platformer Spot Goes to Hollywood in 1995.</desc>

    <desc>Crack Down is a top-down arcade shoot-'em-up title developed by Sega for their Sega System 24 arcade board. It has subsequently been ported to a variety of systems, including the Sega Mega Drive, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS and ZX Spectrum. The Mega Drive version is a common choice for compilations, and has therefore seen several re-releases among other early Mega Drive titles. It has also been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service. For whatever reason, Sega had Sage's Creation publish the Mega Drive port in North America (it may have had to do with HOT-B making the port).

The game features two heroes, Ben and Andy, who have to get through a series of levels as quickly as possible by placing bombs on marked X spots scattered around the levels. The levels are heavily defended, but the player has an array of weaponry including a cannon, machine gun, and superbombs at their disposal in order to stay alive.

Crack Down is unusual in that its System 24 roots mean that the screen is always split into two. As a result, one of the main complaints for weaker systems (with lower screen resolutions) is that the majority of the screen is not used when playing a one-player game.

There is a known glitch in the Amiga version of the game which causes the final level to crash. Recent fan hacks have fixed the problem, but it was never addressed during the production run.</desc>

    <desc>Crusader of Centy in the US, Soleil in Europe, Shin Souseiki Ragnacenty in Japan, and Ragnacenty in Korea, is an adventure game developed by Nextech under contract from Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was translated to Korean (released 1995), English, French, German, and Spanish. The North American release was localized and published by Atlus. The game's music was composed by Motokazu Shinoda, a professional Japanese concert pianist and composer (sound programmer Noriyuki Iwadare is often miscredited as co-composer)

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters - though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be.</desc>

    <desc>Cyborg Justice is a 1993 beat-'em-up for the Sega Mega Drive by Novotrade.

A human astronaut crash-lands on a planet and almost dies, but is "rescued" by robots who take his brain, implant it into a cyborg's shell, and try to erase it so he can become their slave. But #127's brain erase function fails.</desc>

    <desc>One of two well-designed tennis sims from the Old World built around competition for the Davis Cup, one of the sport's top honors.

Now this is more like it! The graphics are a bit silly and the gameplay leans on the arcade side, but it plays smooth and has all the options most people would ever want. Easy to manage, too. It's not the best tennis sim out there, but it'll do for most folks.

Davis Cup World Tour Tennis 2 was never released, but a this playable beta is available.

    <desc>Decap Attack (also styled DEcapAttack) is a 1991 platforming game for the Sega Mega Drive by VIC Tokai. It is a hack of their 1990 game Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daibouken replacing everything except the basic gameplay and most of the engine (the sound driver was changed from SMPS to that used by composer Fumito Tamayama's company Graphic Research). You play as Chuck D. Head, a decapitated mummy who must defeat the forces of the evil Max D.Cap, an underworld warlord who is invading the world of the living.

Gameplay is identical to that of Magical Hat.</desc>

    <desc>Dick Tracy is a 1990 action game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System tying into the 1990 Dick Tracy film.

The game is an action game where Dick Tracy walks around killing bad guys to solve mysteries. The game exists in a pesudo-3D world where enemies either approach from where Dick is or from a distance "behind" him - therefore, Dick has to attack in two different ways. Due to the differences in the two consoles's controllers, controls for each version are slightly different. In order to make this explanation simple, we will use the first level, which takes place on a street with Dick walking along one sidewalk and the other enemies across the street, to explain the different attacks.</desc>

    <desc>Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops is a basketball game with commentary from US sportscaster and former basketball coach Dick Vitale. It features numerous college basketball teams, and was developed and published by Time Warner Interactive in 1994.

The game is unusual in that it attempts to create a fully 3D experience on Sega Mega Drive hardware, something assumed impossible. Depending on who has the ball, the screen rotates to face behind the player, rather than having a side-on view like NBA Jam. Unfortunately due to console limitations, this means there are no backgrounds (minus the floor and hoops), the rotations are choppy and the framerate is lower than in most games.

Though likely intended for a US-only release, Dick Vitale's "Awesome Baby" College Hoops managed to find its way to Australia. Rather than design new box art, Time Warner simply decided to plaster stickers on the box relevant to Australia, creating some tacky results.</desc>

    <desc>Even though Lion King II was plagued by an invincibility bug, it has gained a certain popularity and is often sought out by people venturing into the pirate market. Which might have been a contributing factor in why another Lion King game found its way into existence. While acknowledging its predecessor by calling their creation Lion King 3, whoever created this game decided to forfeit the setting and feel of the other unlicensed, trying to be closer in spirit to the original game instead. Lion King 3 heavily borrows elements, sprites and animations not only from its two prequels, but most of the enemy sprites come from a completely different, unexpected source: Donkey Kong Country! While that one seems to be a surprise at first, these enemy types actually make the game feel closer to the original Lion King than to its successor. Some more enemy types, like the chameleons or the porcupines, also found their way back from game one.

Furthermore, the game utilizes remixed versions of the original soundtrack for its stages; a nice touch especially when hearing it for the first time around. However, these remixes are rather short and, being stuck in an infinite loop per level, can become pretty annoying after a while. Anyhow, all these revisions, as well as the overall feel of the game, give the impression that this third release was created by entirely different people.

The star that turned little Simba into big Simba has also been removed from this "sequel." Instead, you can select the lion of your choice at the very beginning and complete the game either as lion cub or as adult lion. There isn't any difference between those two other than the looks, though. Also, for some levels the character sprite of Simba Jr. has a strange purple tint to it, which makes it seem as though something went wrong during the porting and inclusion of the sprite. Interestingly enough, the character has the right color scheme during the intro.

Yet another staple that was missing in Lion King II but found its way back from the original are boss fights. Even though Lion King 3 consists only of five rather short levels as well, in levels two, four and five you are faced with a special foe. These three characters actually seem to be specifically created for the game, although their designs differ greatly from another. The level two boss, a bear, seems to have strangely contorted extremities and moves in a weird manner, seemingly floating through the air when attacking. The boss patterns are simplistic at best, which is at least counteracted by strong randomization. You can never count on whether a boss enters the screen at the same spot he left, which can make the battles rather confusing affairs. With a fair amount of patience, however, none of these fights turn out to be too hard.

The biggest change which distinguishes this Lion King from the other two is the inclusion of a ranged attack for the lions. After collecting certain icons strewn throughout the five stages, Simba can fire some sort of shockwave to attack enemies from across the screen by swatting the air. While it is rather odd to make it possible for a lion to basically shoot at enemies, it strangely fits into the game rather well. Besides, if one did readily swallow that the movie wanted us to believe that an ostrich would willingly let a lion cub ride on its back, I readily suspend my disbelief when it comes to a lion attacking scorpions with some sort of sonic boom. 

While not exactly a hard affair either, or even a long one (it also contains of only five levels) this game is a tad less entertaining than the second part. It just doesn't seem as fresh and lacks a certain originality compared to its predecessor. It also contains an auto-scrolling level itself, but while the one in Lion King II was rather colorful and with nice scrolling, in Lion King 3 this level turns into an ugly mess, urging you to make lots of blind jumps that more often than not end nowhere and result in the loss of a life  pretty irritating. Furthermore, compared to Lion king II, which only had one major bug (the life bar issue), Lion King 3 suffers from several minor issues. Pretty often you need to swing from a peg, but clipping and collision detecting issues make these swings and jumps very random and irritating. You'll find yourself falling past a peg one time, and clinging from an empty spot in mid-air instead... or falling to your death altogether.

Dropping through solid ground or enemies hanging in mid-air also happen quite often. It is still a nice platformer, though, and unlike its predecessor completing the game actually poses a challenge since you can lose all your lives in this one. The first three levels shouldn't pose much of a problem, but once you reach the auto-scrolling level 4 you're likely to run through your lives in no time.

A Pirate in Disney's clothing 

Now, do these games reach the entertainment value of the original licensed game? Of course not, but that wasn't to be expected. Keep in mind that while the original Lion King was created by professional studios with enormous financial backing and highly qualified programmers and artists, these Chinese hacks were usually created in a rush by rather young, inexperienced programmers that probably weren't all that familiar with the console to begin with. These games don't enjoy quality assurance or intensive playtesting, so unfortunately, they tend to be buggy. Just don't try to see them as legitimate sequels just because they use the Lion King likeness  in that regard they come off as abominations, and Disney certainly would never allow them to exist officially. But nevertheless, these two games, despite their flaws, are actually quite enjoyable.

The second one especially has some nice original touches to it, and with a lot of imagination the third actually has some sort of cheaply made knock-off sequel feel, like a direct-to-video half hour spin-off sequel of the original feature film. They may not exactly be diamonds in the rough... but sometimes, rhinestones can also be pretty.

    <desc>First of all, you should realize that this game has NOTHING to do with the movie's direct-to-video sequels! In fact, apart from directly ripping the main protagonists character sprites from The Lion King, this "sequel" has next-to nothing in common with the official game! That doesn't mean that it is without any entertainment value, however.

Lion King II opens up with a nice little sequence showing a grown lion and its cub running toward the player along the Great Wall of China. This little intro alone looks pretty nice, but also gives a first hint of the qualities and oddities that this game contains. While the sprite of the cub is directly taken from the fourth level of the original, the accompanying sprite of the grown up lion is completely new  and it doesn't look half bad! While certainly looking decent, especially for a pirate Genesis title, the whole scene however raises the first two questions. Number one: What is Simba doing in China? The level cards confirm that this is in fact supposed to be the Great Wall  what gives? And second: Who are these lions supposed to be? Are those Simba and his father, Mufasa? Or is it a grown-up Simba and a cub of his own? Pondering these questions while looking at the nicely-done title screen, however, will not in any kind prepare you for what the game entails. 

The game stretches over five levels, all distinctly set in China. While this makes for a rather short game, each level comes with its own surprises not generally expected from an unlicensed platformer. The first level, for example, contains a short trip on a tiny raft over a river  basically just a moving platform, but a nice touch nonetheless. Level four is a maze that urges you do find the correct path through several doors, which you can only pass once you've eliminated all the enemies in the room. The fifth and final level is actually auto-scrolling, urging you to avoid obstacles and adding a little extra pressure to the gameplay. All this is actually nicely done, and the diversity definitely raises the game's fun factor.

The gameplay itself is pretty different from the original. You start out as little Simba as you make your way through the levels. However, gone are the original's Lion Roar or the ability to roll. Also, better not try jumping on enemies, as each direct contact will now hurt you. So how does little Simba defend himself? Well, even though the programmers directly ripped the character sprite from the original game, they actually went and tinkered a bit with it, adding some new animations and giving little Simba the ability to slash at enemies. The rest of the game, however, completely detaches itself from its licensed predecessor enough that one might call this game Lion King in Name Only and it makes the Chinese setting, odd as it may be, only a side note in all the strangeness going on.

For example: The enemies Simba is confronted with are odd  the first level throws weird teddy bear-like creatures or green monkeys at you. And why does the fifth level feature floating propeller-platforms sporting a Swastika? Strangest of all? As you start out as a small lion cub, each time you pick up a Star, your character turns into the big Simba sprite! While such power ups aren't too uncommon (like Mario turning big each time he picks up a mushroom), it seems pretty out of place when this character is supposed to be the Lion King of Disney fame! Being hit once makes the character turn back into a lion cub. Apart from growing bigger and thus gaining a slightly bigger reach for swatting enemies, this feature doesn't affect the rest of the game at all. It's just weird.

Overall, it makes for a short, but nice little game. There is just one really big problem with it: It appears to be broken in a very strange way. I don't mean the fact that sometimes Simba might fall through solid ground or hang from invisible ledges  which is annoying, but doesn't happen too often. Whenever you're being hit by an enemy, though, the life bar doesn't register it. The game acts like you were hit, including throwing you into a short period of invincibility, but it doesn't matter. You're not completely invulnerable, however, since spikes hurt you as normal, but even then, though they deplete your energy and you die, you still don't get a life subtracted. This seems to be a common phenomenon in every version of the bootleg I've encountered so far, and the same bug has been confirmed by others who own it. It seems to be an oversight on the programmer's part.

The fact that you can't really die, combined with the shortness of the entire affair, makes for a very easy game that can be easily beaten to enjoy the fireworks afterwards.

The original Mega Drive version was only released in Europe and Brazil, as Nintendo had secured a deal with Disney to ensure no Donald Duck games were released on rival systems in North America. It was also the first game to be developed under the Disney Interactive label.

Donald in Maui Mallard would be tuned up significantly and brought to the SNES as Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow, with later ports to Windows PCs and the Game Boy. Interestingly these versions omit all references to Donald Duck, citing that the main character's name is "Maui Mallard".</desc>

    <desc>Double Dragon II: The Revenge is a action game developed and published by Technos in 1988 as a sequel to the original Double Dragon. Originally for the arcades, it was later ported to a variety of systems. PALSOFT ported the game to the Sega Mega Drive and released it exclusively in Japan in 1991. The port was fairly accurate in comparison to the NES version.

The Black Warriors shoot and kill Marian, whom was saved by Billy and Jimmy Lee from the same gang in the first Double Dragon, and now Billy and Jimmy fight to avenge her. Most of the enemies from the first game re-appear but with slightly redrawn sprites.

Similar to the first Double Dragon game, there are four levels available. This includes a heliport, a lumber storehouse, a wheat field, and the bosses lair. Willy returns as the next to final boss but is succeeded by a double of the main character(s). Depending on how many are playing at the time one or two doubles will appear.</desc>

    <desc>Double Dragon is a 1987 arcade beat-'em-up by Technos. It was ported to a variety of consoles; Accolade brought it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and Sega to the Sega Master System in 1988. Accolade's version was licensed by Sega, despite the ROM header saying otherwise.

The Mega Drive port is a straight port of the arcade with slight differences in graphics and sound. The enemies also easily mimic the players up and down movement, which can lead to some annoyance.

The Master System version has slightly different controls due to the controller only having two buttons. Some parts of the levels are designed differently and extended. The mohawk Abobo is missing in this version. Unlimited continues are available up until the final stage (although unlimited continues can be attained in the final stage through a cheat).</desc>

The game was also distributed in Portugal where it is simply called Dragon Ball Z. The distributor, Ecofilmes, would take Japanese copies of the game, replace the cover (but keep the manual and cart), and sell the game as is, promising a free converter cart as the Japanese cartridges cannot fit into European Mega Drives. When the French version came out, they switched to using that version instead.</desc>

Technosoft acquired a license to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Devil Crash MD and releasing it in Japan. They would then license it to Tengen for localization overseas; Tengen censored a few graphics deemed too Satanic for western audiences and released the final product as Dragon's Fury in the US and Europe (hence the page name) despite the TurboGrafx-16 version having been released internationally beforehand. While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.</desc>

    <desc>Dragon's Revenge is a pinball game developed and published by Tengen as a sequel to Dragon's Fury/Devil Crash MD. The game was released exclusively on the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. Despite it being marked as a sequel, its production did not involve either Naxat Soft or Compile, who were responsible for the development of Devil Crash and the rest of the "Crush" pinball series (and in fact, they had already made a sequel to Devil Crush by then, the Japan-exclusive SNES Jaki Crush released in 1992), nor did it involve Technosoft who had ported Devil Crash to the Mega Drive and licensed it out to Tengen for it to be published overseas.

The goal, gameplay, and controls are identical to Dragon's Fury; it is unknown whether or not there is a way to win the game. Pausing will immediately show the password.</desc>

    <desc>The game is based on the earlier Japanese puzzler Puyo Puyo. It was released to the North American and European markets in November 1993. Though not a commercial success initially, it became more popular with time. It was later also released in various compilations and other forms.

It was also released by Samsung in South Korea under the name Dong Gu Ri Te Chi Jak Jeon. For whatever reason, some number of cartridges (between only the first run and half of the entire production) was produced by taking a Puyo Puyo cart, sticking the Dong Gu Ri label on, and placing it in the Dong Gu Ri packaging and selling it as is - meaning that South Korean copies of the game will either contain the correct Korean version of Mean Bean Machine or will actually be Puyo Puyo.</desc>

In 1997, the game was ported over to the Sega Saturn by Lobotomy Software and published by Sega. Rather than running in the Build engine, the developer ported the game under their own 3D engine custom made for the Saturn labeled "SlaveDriver" which was also used for their other PC to console ports such as PowerSlave/Exhumed and Quake. The Saturn port also received an exclusive level named "Urea 51."

In 1998, Tec Toy released a Mega Drive remake in Brazil with substantially different gameplay mechanics, levels, and a simplified engine; refer to that page for details.</desc>

This game oozes quirky from every pore. That's certainly what I took from it after the credits had rolled. Dynamite Headdy is injected with that nonsensical asian flavour that defies description.

You play as Headdy, a puppet who has escaped from the clutches of Dark Demon, with a physique very much like Rayman and it is up to you to defeat him for woefully obvious reasons.

Gameplay revolves around shooting your head at things to climb around and beat up enemies with various powerups abound which grant your head different abilities.

A credit to the diversity of this game, a series of powerups are used in what amounts to a shoot 'em up series of levels. Also present is a basketball minigame where you bounce balls into the nets with your head.

Very tight controls, colourful, whacky presentation, and solid platforming make Dynamite Headdy among my favourite Genesis titles. Rock on.

Translation Description:

Dynamite Headdy was one of those great games that unfortunately went through a process known as "localization". Nearly all the dialogue was removed, and what little remained was changed. Furthermore, many of the graphics were modified and this already challenging game had its difficulty level pumped up significantly.

Now you can play the original version of one of Treasure's truly innovative games, in English.

    <desc>Dyno Blaze is a cancelled beat 'em up that was in development by Bonsai Entertainment for the Genesis / Mega Drive, Mega CD and 3DO in 1994 and it would have been published by Virgin. A playable prototype of the game was somehow leaked online in 2008, in which you can try a series of (almost empty) levels where to move your rollerblade-dinosaur to fight enemies with an hockey stick. The levels are incomplete and bugged but it's possible to go trought them waiting for a bit at the end of the area and pressing the jump button.

The original press release for the game:

Today, Virgin Interactive Entertainment and Bonsai Entertainment Corporation signed a multi-SKU development contract for DYNOBLAZE?, an original game for SEGA CD and SEGA GENESIS.

Bonsai Entertainment will develop the original game based upon designs previously developed. "It's a game about 'Teenage Mutant Ninga Dinosaurs', that play street hockey on the streets of New York", said Joseph Moses, President of Bonsai Entertainment. He added, "Teaming up with Virgin, already a key player in this industry, is a major step for Bonsai. We intend to make them very proud."

"DynoBlaze" is scheduled for Christmas 1995 release across multiple platforms.

A weird Dyno Blaze proto was seen at the Video Game History 2008 expo in Monza (Italy), organized by our friends at Games Collection. In the VGH2K8 proto you can just see a rolling demo of the game's menu (without any gameplay) and a strange graph for a medicine know as "Lotensin" by CibaGeneva pharmaceuticals. We dont have any clue about what this all means, so if you have a good explanation feel free to share it!

Thanks to Jean-Fran?ois Th?b? for the contribution!

    <desc>Earnest Evans is a 1991 platforming action game developed by Wolf Team for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD released in the US and Japan as exclusives for the respective consoles. It is the first in the trilogy followed by El Viento and Anetto Futatabi - however it was released after El Viento, so this may actually be a port.

Earnest Evans III is on a quest to complete his grandfather's mission of saving the Earth from destruction by hiding three ancient idols with that power from evil hands, in Earnest Evans III's case the bounty hunter Brady Tresidder. Along the way, you meet Annet Myer, your companion through the wilderness, and Sigfried, who knows a lot about the history of the idols.</desc>

    <desc>Earthworm Jim 2 is the direct sequel to Earthworm Jim, released on the Sega Mega Drive, Super Nintendo and DOS computers in 1995. Enhanced versions were released on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and more recently the game has been released on the Game Boy Advance, Windows PC (through Steam and Good Old Games) and the Wii's Virtual Console service.

Though very similar to the original game, Earthworm Jim 2 has more varied gameplay than its predecessor. As well as including standard platforming levels, there are also quiz questions, an isometric shoot 'em up level and various adaptions to the platforming formula, including marathon races and a stage where Jim must shoot his way through mounds of dirt. It retains the surreal humour from the first game and was followed by Earthworm Jim 3D in 1999.</desc>

    <desc>Earthworm Jim is a platform video game developed by Shiny Entertainment in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. Highly praised at the time of release, Earthworm Jim offers very detailed and smooth graphics, a very well received soundtrack and large amounts of surreal humour and parodies of popular culture.

Earthworm Jim takes place over 7 main levels (8 in the Mega CD version), plus 7 bonus segments between levels, a boss you can avoid if you're good enough and a hidden bonus level halfway through the game.

Earthworm Jim was quickly ported to a variety of systems including the Sega Game Gear, Super Nintendo and Game Boy. It was released for the Sega Master System in 1996 exclusively in Brazil by Sega's distributor Tec Toy. Enhanced versions of the game including a CD audio soundtrack were released for the Sega Mega CD and Windows PCs, and in more recent times ports have been made to the Game Boy Advance, iPhone, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and the Wii's Virtual Console service.

The game was followed by Earthworm Jim 2 and a variety of other sequels. It also led to a cartoon show by Universal Animation Studios, which is arguably one of the more successful video game cartoon adaptions of all time.</desc>

    <desc>Ecco the Dolphin (sometimes known simply as Ecco) is a successful video game developed by Novotrade International and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System (only in Europe), Sega Game Gear and later Sega Mega CD. It is one of the Mega Drive's most well-known titles, and spawned numerous sequels. The game features a bottlenosed dolphin named Ecco on a sidescrolling underwater adventure. The game is noted for its high difficulty level, and though appears to appeal to a younger audience, has a much deeper and darker story than anticipated. Ecco on the Mega CD features a full redbook audio soundtrack composed by Spencer Nilsen and has re-designed levels.

Ecco was has been re-released in several formats over the years, usually in its original Mega Drive form. It was included in Sega Mega Drive Collection for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Sony PlayStation Portable, and was released as a downloadable title through the RealOne Arcade service (also in the form of a one hour trial version). In 2006 it was released on the Wii's Virtual Console service, and in 2007 became a downloadable title through the Xbox Live Arcade service. Ecco was also included in Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection. It was also ported to the PC in 1996.

Ecco the Dolphin was followed by Ecco: The Tides of Time.</desc>

    <desc>Ecco Jr. is an spin-off of the Ecco the Dolphin series, aimed at younger children. It was released in 1995 for the Sega Mega Drive, though a similar Sega Pico title named Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt! was also made available.

Ecco the Dolphin had been a huge success for Sega and Novotrade, but both it and its sequel are often regarded as very challenging and often confusing video games meaning they are unsuitable for the young market. Despite this, Ecco was bought with young children in mind, which prompted the creation of Ecco Jr. which would attempt to appeal to a younger audience with the extreme difficulty removed. Unlike other games in the series, it is impossible for Ecco (or his friends) to die, and the focus is placed on completing simple tasks and on educational material about dolphins.

Despite the lack of gameplay value for older gamers, Ecco Jr. has been re-released as part of the PlayStation 2/PlayStation Portable title Sega Mega Drive Collection and Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection. It was also released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>ESWAT: City Under Siege is a Sega Mega Drive action game released for the console in 1990. It is a reimagining fo the 1989 arcade game ESWAT: Cyber Police, though aside from minor similarites, it is an entirely different game. It is often confused with ESWAT: Cyber Police, not least because the Japanese version of this release calls the game Cyber Police ESWAT.

ESWAT: Cyber Police was brought to many home systems around the same period as ESWAT: City Under Siege, adding further confusion to the naming scheme. The Sega Master System version of ESWAT: Cyber Police calls itself ESWAT: City Under Siege on its title screen, but is again, unrelated to this Mega Drive game.

The Mega Drive version is the most common of the two ESWAT games, having been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service and included in numerous recent Mega Drive compilations.</desc>

In Career Mode, you can create your own boxer with several predefined appearance settings and stats (which are mutual - changing one will change the others appropriately). In Exhibition Mode, you can only choose from various professional boxers.

The graphics and match engine would be reused in the 1994 game Greatest Heavyweights.</desc>

    <desc>Exile, called Exile: Toki no Hazama he in Japan, is a 1991 RPG by Telenet Japan released on the Sega Mega Drive. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT called "XZR" in Japan; where this false name came from is unknown. Furthermore, the game may not have originated on the Mega Drive, it may have been ported to other platforms, and it may also actually be a sequel to an earlier game (which may have been called XZR). The exact situation with this game is unknown (or at least not known in English).

Over the course of human history, one country managed to conquer the world through war - only to be destroyed by the desert warrior Sadler. Peace did not last long: Sadler waged a brutal war with Luciel, a rival tribe.</desc>

    <desc>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.

Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US - therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).</desc>

    <desc>F-22 Interceptor: Advanced Tactical Fighter is a flight simulation shoot-'em-up game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive. It has the player pilot a fictional F-22 jet fighter, blowing up airebourne enemies and ground targets. The game was released in 1991, a full fourteen years before the F-22 Raptor came into service.

The game is widely criticised for its slugglish controls and lag, partly because F-22 Interceptor tries to render 3D polygons in certain locations. It is notable for having multiple camera perspectives, however - something not seen in many video games of the time.</desc>

Initially released in arcades, the game was ported to a variety of home platforms including the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. The Mega Drive port was handled by Takara (but published by Sega), and, like the SNES version, is said to be inferior to the Neo Geo original.

In Fatal Fury, the user can select one of three characters - brothers Terry Bogard and Andy Bogard or Joe, who must defeat Geese Howard.</desc>

    <desc>Fatal Labyrinth, called Shi no Meikyuu: Labyrinth of Death in Japan, is a role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. In Japan, it was a Sega Game Toshokan download exclusive. In the game you play as Trykaar, who must enter Dragonia, the castle of doom and traverse its thirty levels to retrieve the Holy Goblet.

The game is a roguelike where most levels of the castle are chosen at random from a predefined set. You will find monsters and items scattered at random.

The game ends when you run out of health. You regain health by eating food found as items on the ground; health will slowly regenerate while you have health left to regenerate. If you run out of food, you will rapidly lose health until you eat food or die. If you eat too much food (the "F" counter on the HUD exceeds 80), you will slow down. Eat more (F=99) and you die.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA International Soccer (known as FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition for its Sega Mega CD release), is the first game in the long-running FIFA series, developed by Extended Play Productions and published by Electronic Arts.

As well as being released for the Sega Mega CD, it was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System, as well as several non-Sega consoles and computers. Most ports were released in 1993, though the Mega CD version and some Japanese ports were delayed until 1994 (and in some cases, even 1995). The Master System version was exclusive to Brazil, and is a port of the Game Gear version.

Unlike later FIFA games which are presented in full 3D, FIFA International Soccer goes for an isometric perspective and has much simpler gameplay. Also, though it allows the user to play as official international teams, it does not feature official player names. Nevertheless, the combination of isometric graphics and a commentator set it aside from its rivals, namely the Sensible Soccer and Kick Off series.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA Soccer 95 is a football game developed by Extended Play Productions published by Electronic Arts. It is the second licensed FIFA video game, following FIFA International Soccer and was the first to start the annual naming trend which continues to this day.

FIFA 95 was only released on the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear, under the motto "The best console soccer can get!". It was the first soccer game to feature licensed clubs from several different international leagues, like the Major League (USA), Premier League (UK) and the Bundesliga (Germany).
The game was also famous for its music, made by Jeff Dyck. The sound driver is very advanced and uses two PCM channels using software mixing and variable sample frequency.

It also offers a four-player mode using Electronic Arts' "4-Way-Play" device.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA Soccer '96 is an entry to the FIFA series of video games, and was developed by Extended Play Productions and published by Electronic Arts. Though it was not the first FIFA game (both FIFA Soccer '95 and FIFA International Soccer had come before it), FIFA 96 is often considered the first truly successful FIFA game, and opened the doors to annual sequels that continue to this day. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega 32X , Sega Saturn, Sega Game Gear, DOS, PlayStation, SNES, and Game Boy.

Though not all versions could handle all the new features FIFA 96 brought to the table, the game was revolutionary for having a running commentary provided by John Motson, and it was the first 3D entry to the series.</desc>

    <desc>
Flashback, known in the US as Flashback: The Quest for Identity, is a platform-action game for the Commodore Amiga developed by Delphine Software and published by U.S. Gold in 1992. Arguably Delphine Software's greatest work, it has been ported to a variety of platforms, including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD, as well as 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Atari Jaguar, CD-i, DOS, FM Towns, iPhone OS, Mac OS, NEC PC-9801, and SNES. CD-based versions tend to include full motion video cutscenes and an enhanced music soundtrack, but are essentially the same game.

In Flashback the player controls Conrad B. Hart, who having escaped from aliens finds himself in the jungles of Titan with his memory erased. He must recover his memory and save earth from an alien attack. The game is largely inspired by Prince of Persia, though has many notable improvements such as a weapon system. The game was well received due to its fluid animations and stealth-like gameplay.
The Sega versions of the game have one notable difference than other versions - Conrad wears a white shirt, presumably due to a more limited on-screen color palette.

The game was followed by a 3D title, Fade to Black, a PlayStation 1 exclusive. Plans for a second sequel called Flashback Legends was due for the Game Boy Advance, but was cancelled. Leaked prototypes show a significant amount of graphical and story changes that barely resemble the world built up in the previous titles. As Delphine Software no longer exist, the chances of a true sequel are slim.</desc>

    <desc>F1, known as Formula One on North American packaging is a formula one racing game developed by Lankhor/Teque London and published by Domark. It should not be confused with the later game, F1 World Championship Edition, also published by Domark. F1 was released in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear.

No versions of this game were released in Japan, while the Game Gear version was exclusive to North America.

F1 is notable because unlike earlier attempts at Formula One such as Super Monaco GP, it is able to simulate changes in height. This meant at the time it was one of the most realistic racers around.</desc>

Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball is a 1995 baseball game for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear, Sega Saturn, SNES, and other consoles by Iguana Entertainment and Acclaim.

When pitching, you choose the type of pitch you want to make from a series of lists. If the ball has been hit, you have full control over the rest of the team to try to knock the other guy out; in this case, all the buttons will throw the ball to the nearest player facing you. When swinging, you can only move horizontally across the batting area and have only one type of swing.</desc>

    <desc>Frogger is a video game originally developed by Konami running on Namco's Galaxian hardware and released in arcades in 1981. Frogger was a massive success in arcades and has been ported to numerous platforms as well as spawning numerous sequels and remakes (and unofficial clones).

Distribution and publishing rights to Frogger were held by Sega in the early 1980s, which were then sold on to other companies for home use (for example, Parker Brothers had the ROM cartridge rights and Sierra On-Line held the magnetic media rights). Often this would lead to some video game consoles and computers receiving multiple ports of Frogger. Sega distributed three diffeerent arcade versions of Frogger, one of which ran on the modified version of the Galaxian hardware used by Nichibutsu's Moon Cresta.

Frogger bypassed Sega's consoles and computers during the 1980s, but eventually saw a North American release on the Sega Mega Drive in 1998 by Majesco (who had at this point been given the rights to distribute Sega's older consoles in this region). It was the last Sega Mega Drive game to be released in North America (and was a North American exclusive). Coincidentally Frogger was also the last SNES game to be released in that region. Both copies of the game recycle box art from Frogger 3D, a three-dimensional sequel released a year earlier.

Unfortunately the Mega Drive port is merely a straight arcade port, with no enhanced graphics or sound, bar a new title screen.

Plans for a Sega Game Gear version of Frogger were put in place, but were ultimately scrapped. It is rumoured that licensing issues caused this, though a working protoype of the game has since been found.</desc>

    <desc>Fun 'n' Games is a 1993 game for the Sega Mega Drive by Leland Interactive Media and Tradewest. When Tradewest brought the game to Europe for Sony Electronic Publishing to publish the following year, Leland and Tradewest gave it a new logo, box art, main menu, presentation, and name Fun 'n Games (though the back of the box still says Fun 'n' Games), which would then be used for the SNES and 3DO ports, released later in 1994 (the last after Williams bought Leland and Tradewest).

There are four game modes. The original American release presented these in the form of objects in a "Fun 'n' Games Clubhouse"; all other releases use a simple text menu.</desc>

In the year 3000, humans have polluted Earth to such an extent that Gulfer, a group of space pirates, plan to use the pollution to fuel weapons of mass destruction. The United Star Cluster of Leezaluth feel the only way to stop this from happening is to blow the Sun up, but allows the humans one chance to save themselves: by sending Dan Dare (Diaz in Japan) in a special ship to stop Gulfer. Aiding Dan in a special sub-ship is the TOZ System, run by Leezaluth emissary Alexis, which can steal powers from the space pirates's own ships. Should you succeed, Leezaluth will give the humans a new planet to inhabit.</desc>

    <desc>Galaxy Force II is a 1988 arcade game developed by Sega AM2. It is a sequel to Galaxy Force, though the differences between the two games minimal. It is a third person on-the-rails shoot 'em up, where the player controls a spaceship traveling across various planets destroying enemies. Like all Sega Y Board games, it is heavily reliant on sprite scaling and rotations.

Besides a change in title screen, the exact differences between Galaxy Force and Galaxy Force II are not yet known. Galaxy Force II, however, was housed in much simpler, "traditional" arcade cabinets unlike its prequel.

Galaxy Force II was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1989, and a selection of computers including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the inferior hardware of these systems, large cutbacks were made regarding detail and the reception has hence been mixed. There was a more respectable port to the FM Towns Marty in Japan however, which kept the sprite scaling, and there was a re-release for the Sega Saturn under the Sega Ages label. Many of the computer releases mis-label the packaging as "Galaxy Force" rather than "Galaxy Force II", but the in-game title screens retain the numbering. A port to NEC's SuperGrafx was also in development and shown in magazines, but never completed.

The arcade game has since been re-released in Japan as part of the PlayStation 2's Sega Ages 2500 series. More recently, the Mega Drive version of the game was brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>Garfield: Caught in the Act is a platformer game starring the characters from the Garfield comic series. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1995, and was brought to Windows in 1996 as a stand-alone title as well as through the Sonic &amp; Garfield Pack. A port to the Sega 32X under the title of Garfield in TV Land was planned, but scrapped, though the name was still used in some later re-releases. The original Mega Drive game features six levels. Sega Channel subscribers could download Garfield: The Lost Levels, that featured 3 different levels.

The Game Gear version includes eight levels, two of which appear in the Lost Levels. There is only one type of bonus stage (accessed by finding an icon of Arlene's face in each level), in which you try to wreck everything in Jon's living room within a time limit to get an extra life. Garfield does not have different outfits in each level, and the attacks are the same in all levels (his close-range is a punch, and the projectile are stones). There are no invincibility items. In the between-level segments, you do not take damage from the obstacles; instead, they teleport you back to the start of that segment.

In the PC, there is a new level, Alien Landscape, and the Mega Drive levels are arranged in a different order.</desc>

    <desc>Gargoyles is an action game for the Sega Mega Drive made in 1995 by Buena Vista Interactive made to tie in with the Gargoyles television series created by Buena Vista for Disney (though the Disney name is nowhere to be found on the actual game).

The game uses the MC68000's tas (test and set) opcode to do condition-related things (exactly what is unknown; TODO). tas runs in a different way from other CPUs, and for some unknown reason the Genesis is wired differently. The designers of the Genesis 3 overlooked this, and for some unknown reason, the game will not run on this model, making it the only game not to run on the Genesis 3 due to something other than additional hardware not being supported.</desc>

    <desc>Royal Blood is a 1991 strategy game by Koei for various Japanese computers from its "Imagination Series." It has been ported to many other systems and its international releases renamed Gemfire in those regions. A port to the Sega Mega Drive was released in the US and Japan in 1992.

Ishmeria is an island inhabited by humans and mythical creatures guarded by six magicians. A Fire Dragon challenged them, and the battle that ensued resulted in a curse being set on magic itself: whoever wears the Crown of Seven Jewels has full control of the island's magic. That person is King Eselred, whose tyranny led his daughter Robyn to take the jewels from the crown, which hold the magic power, and scatter them around. Now, the six wizards, each united with six noble families of Ishmeria, and Eselred, united with the Fire Dragon, must race to get the jewels first - should they fall back into Eselred's hands, all hope for the Ishmeria's freedom will be lost.

There are several scenarios to play. In each, you control one of the six noble families, each in control of a country on the island. The game is played by taking control of the country as it fights neighboring countries, develops its own land, and makes diplomatic agreements toward the goal.</desc>

    <desc>Ghouls'n Ghosts, called Daimakaimura in Japan, is an arcade platformer developed by Capcom and is the sequel to Ghost'n Goblins. It first appeared in December 1988, and was subsequently ported to the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sharp X68000, SuperGrafx and ZX Spectrum. It follows the knight Arthur who must restore souls stolen by the evil Lucifer (including that of his lover, Princess Prin Prin).

Though it is considered a classic, Ghouls'n Ghosts is notoriously difficult thanks to the constant waves of enemies and traps despite Arthur only having a couple of hit points.

For a while, the Sega Mega Drive version (released in 1989 and ported and published by Sega) was considered the most accurate home port of the game, and was a selling point for the Mega Drive console. This version has since been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>G-LOC: Air Battle (G-LOC meaning "G-force induced Loss Of Consciousness") is an air combat simulator developed by Sega AM2. It is a spiritual sequel to After Burner II, featuring similar gameplay ideas and some recycled sound effects, though has always been publically advertised as a different game entirely. Unlike games using the After Burner name, G-LOC uses a first person perspective, though it does occasionally pan out to a third person view when the player's plane is locked onto by an enemy.
Like After Burner, the goal is to eliminate enemy planes, though in G-LOC there are also ground units. The original arcade version runs on more advanced Sega Y Board hardware, and makes heavy use of sprite scaling/rotation and pre-rendered 3D graphics.

G-LOC is notable for being one of the first video games to offer an arcade cabinet which could rotate 360 degrees on all three axes, immersing the player in the action. These versions of the game are sometimes referred to as G-LOC R360, though the gameplay itself is identical.

Though not as popular in arcades as After Burner, G-LOC was still ported to a variety of home platforms, including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. Computer ports, often going by the name G-LOC R360 were released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. All these versions suffer from various cutbacks due to weaker hardware, though some versions add extra features such as boss battles.

G-LOC was followed by Strike Fighter, which is extremely similar in design but ditches the time-based missions in favour of gameplay more akin to After Burner.</desc>

    <desc>Gods is a 1991 platformer by The Bitmap Brothers, originally released for the Commodore Amiga and later ported to a variety of home consoles and computers, including a 1992 port to the Sega Mega Drive. This version was the first game published by Accolade after acquiring an official license after winning Sega v. Accolade (though they still presumably continued to press unlicensed games).

"Four guardians" have broken the citadel used to protect the city of the gods, and have asked any warrior to retake the citadel in return for a favor. You play as one such warrior, who asks to become a god himself, equal to the others.</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe III is a Sega Mega Drive exclusive sequel to Golden Axe II. Its original Mega Drive release never showed up in the west, only being available in Japan, Asia and South Korea. It has since been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service and has been made available for more regions of the world.

The game is similar to previous entries in the series, but includes new characters, an expanded moveset and forks within levels where you can choose which path to take.

By changing RAM values while the game is running, it is possible to play as any standard enemy within the game (though many will cause the game to crash when their special move is activated, or will have glitched graphics/collision values when played).</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe II is the direct sequel to the critically acclaimed Golden Axe. Unlike its prequel, however, Golden Axe II is a Sega Mega Drive exclusive (though it has since been re-released as part of numerous Mega Drive compilations). It was initially released in 1991.

Like its predecessor, Golden Axe II is a beat-em-up game starring Ax-Battler, Tyris-Flare and Gilius Thunderhead. Replacing Death Adder as the antagonist is a new being named "Dark Guld".

Golden Axe II has received mixed reviews from critics. Many claim the game is merely a re-hash of the previous entry in the series, as very little is added to the core gameplay. Though some have praised the graphics and music, others have criticised the game's poor sound effects which are said to ruin the atmosphere of the game. Luckily, many of these concerns were addressed in the sequel, Golden Axe III.</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe is a beat-'em-up developed by Sega and released in 1989 for Sega System 16 arcade hardware. The development team was headded by Makoto Uchida, who also led the team behind Altered Beast.

The game was the first in the long-running Golden Axe series. It is said to be heavily inspired by the Conan the Barbarian films, and that the game took roughly one year to make.

The game has enjoyed many years of success on the Sega Mega Drive, and was used in the early days of the console to advertise the system's power over its then-main rival, the Nintendo Entertainment System. Some levels were shortened, but an extra level was added which includes another boss, "Doom Bringer". Also in this version is a "duel" mode, which allows players to fight a succession of enemies one-on-one.

The Mega Drive version of the game has been included in numerous compilations, such as 6-Pak, Mega Games 2, Mega Games 6 and Mega Games 10. The game has also been emulated and sold in the form of Sega Smash Pack Volume 1, Sega PC Smash Pack, Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection, Sega Archives from USA Vol. 1 and Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection Volume 1, as well as services such as PlaySega and built-in to numerous consoles by AtGames.

This version was so popular that it got direct sequels in the form of Golden Axe II and Golden Axe III. In the arcades, the "true" sequel is Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder. A Sega Mega-Tech version also exists, which is based on the Mega Drive version, as is the version released for the Wii's Virtual Console service.

The Mega Drive Golden Axe was enhanced for the Sega Mega CD and delivered as part of Sega Classics Arcade Collection. This version is single-player only, though offers numerous improvements in terms of audio and some graphical tweaks.</desc>

    <desc>Granada is a 1990 shoot-'em-up by Wolf Team released in the US and Japan for the Sega Mega Drive and in Japan for the X68000. "Granada" is a mobile tank-like weapon whose origin is uncertain. In September 2016, Leon Todo, a private mercenary, accepts a task from an enterprise agent that takes him to Japan, where he finds Granada and uses it to complete said task.

The player is situated in a large field full of enemies, obstacles, and enemy generators that may be freely moved upon (unlike most conventional shoot-'em-ups). The goal of each level is to destroy each enemy generator (red dots on the HUD in the bottom right corner) and then a boss all before the timer runs out.</desc>

    <desc>Hard Drivin' is a 1988 arcade driving game developed by Atari Games and later ported to numerous consoles and computers including the Sega Mega Drive. The aim is to race around a course as fast as possible without crashing.

Hard Drivin' is notable for its use of 3D polygon graphics, which was considered too processor-intensive to be plausible on the systems of the day. Though less impressive than the Commodore 64 or Amstrad CPC versions, Hard Drivin' on the Mega Drive still stands out as being one of the few games on the console to attempt 3D.

One of Hard Drivin''s sequels, Race Drivin' also made it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1992.</desc>

    <desc>Harry Potter for the Sega Mega Drive is an unlicensed release loosely based around the Harry Potter novels (and films). The title screen actually reads Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen, as the artwork is borrowed from German promotional material for the first film. It was developed by "KuKuzz" for emurussia forums in 2004, though has since made its way onto the black market and sold as a retail product.

The game is very similar to Pac-Man (or Pac-Mania), and has Harry travel across isometric mazes with themese slightly similar to those found in the books. He has to collect a certain amount of flying golden snitches, while avoiding a handful of other characters, many of which have no relation to the series whatsoever. The game steals music from the film as well as Street Fighter II and Puzzle Bobble.</desc>

Hellfire does not follow the typical powerup system of most shmups of the time. Instead, your ship, the CNCS1, can fire either straight to the right (pink), straight to the left (yellow), straight up and down (green), or diagonally in four directions (blue).</desc>

    <desc>Insector X is a side-scrolling shooter developed by Taito for the arcades in 1989 and ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990, with HOT-B publishing it in Japan and Sage's Creation publishing it in the US. It is the only Mega Drive game Taito developed but not published themselves (in fact the port may have actually been made by HOT-B but this requires confirmation).

The game has the insect-like main character, Kai, going through a number of nature-based and cave environments. The player can collect a variety of powerups and weapon upgrades to defeat oncoming enemies and bosses.

The plot is fairly simplistic and ultimately involves defeating the dark ruler queen, freeing the insect world from her power.</desc>

    <desc>For a young, unseasoned video game developer, nothing quite beats the grand satisfaction of seeing his or her first commercial project through to the end. After many long, hard days and nights of coding, testing and debugging, the light at the end of the tunnel finally approaches, and the pride and expectation of wanting to view the final product on a store shelf is nearly overwhelming. Unfortunately for some, despite having thrown their heart and soul into the work and endured all the stress along the way, that wondrous day of release... never comes. Instead, their heart sinks as they are shuffled off to another project.

Such was the story for Matt Harmon, the lead designer and programmer of the Sega Genesis action game, It Came From The Desert. An eager young hacker turned professional developer, Matt was put in charge of the entire project and worked feverishly to complete it in good time. However, despite getting the game to a near completed state, he was told that it was over; the game had been shelved indefinitely by the publisher.

While the prototype version of It Came From The Desert is legally available for free download directly from Cinemaware's website, it's certainly not the style of release Matt had originally hoped for, nor the only one this game deserved. However, while the chances for neglected title's commercial release may have died many years ago, its story will be immortalized. 

The whole interview with Matt Harmon can be read here:

This game was released right in the middle of the lawsuit between Sega and Accolade. As such, initial US copies of the game were distributed without a license from Sega. After the lawsuit was dropped, US packaging would include a Sega Seal of Quality, but in the form of an added sticker. EU versions, released slightly later, would be distributed in redesigned packaging, complete with official Sega branding.</desc>

    <desc>James Pond II: Codename RoboCod (also known as Super James Pond or Super James Pond II) is a platforming sequel to James Pond. It was released on a variety of platforms, including the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 (and the only Mega Drive entry in the series released in Japan) and the Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System in 1993. The game has numerous parodies to the film RoboCop, including a similar theme song.

Gameplay differs heavily from the original. This game is a conventional platformer, with James Pond moving on land and jumping without the aid or need for water. There are no missions; instead, Pond must find an exit sign in each level (accessible through doors into a building in the overworld).</desc>

    <desc>James Pond 3: Operation Starfish (sometimes spelt James Pond 3: Operation Starfi5h, in reference to the in-game F.I.5.H. secret service), is the third game in the James Pond series and is a direct sequel to James Pond II: Codename RoboCod. The working title for the game was James Pond 3: Splash Gordon, a pun on Flash Gordon.

Like its predecessor, the game is a platformer, this time set in space. The gameplay seems to be inspired by both Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario World.

Initially programmed for the Commodore Amiga, it was ported to the Amiga CD32, SNES, Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear.</desc>

    <desc>James Pond: Underwater Agent is first in a series of games developed by Millennium Interactive. It was first released on the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in 1990, and was ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Acorn Archimedes in 1991. In the game, the player controls a fish named Pond, who needs to complete a series of rescue missions and stop the evil Doctor Maybe from polluting the world's oceans. Unlike later games in the series, James Pond is not a traditional platform game, as most of the game takes place underwater (similar to Ecco the Dolphin).</desc>

    <desc>Jelly Boy was one of those "lost" Platformers of the SNES-era. By this, I mean it was a game of exceptional quality that got lost within the many, many poorly designed 2D Platformers that plagued that console generation. Subsequently this game, like Plok or Skyblazer or any decent non-Mario-affiliated platformer, went largely unnoticed by the general gaming public on release.

Jelly Boy puts in the control of a jelly baby with morphing powers, sort of like if A Boy and His Blob merged together in some ungodly ritual. His quest is to find various items inside a weird factory so that the elevator doorman will allow him to go up and meet the dude in charge. Awesome music, polished graphics, a whole bunch of detailed levels and worlds and a bizarre sense of humor brighten up an otherwise generic platformer.

    <desc>Jeopardy!: Deluxe Edition is a 1993 game by Park Place Productions and GameTek based on the Jeopardy! television game show. Unlike GameTek's other Jeopardy! games, this one only appeared on two platforms: the Sega Mega Drive and the SNES.

The game itself looks, sounds, and plays exactly like the regular Jeopardy! Mega Drive game (to the point that "Deluxe Edition" does not appear anywhere except the ROM header; this is not the case in the SNES version, where the "Deluxe Edition" is shown in-game).</desc>

The Mega Drive version supports up to three human players and looks like the original show (during the game's release), however the Game Gear version is rather stripped down, with only two contestants in a game, no CPU-vs.-CPU play, and poorer quality graphics.

Both games received updates in Jeopardy!: Sports Edition and the Mega Drive version received one in Jeopardy!: Deluxe Edition.</desc>

    <desc>Jim Power: The Arcade Game is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive platform game developed by Loriciel.

Despite its name, there was not an arcade release of Jim Power - it is in fact a re-tooled version of a 1993 SNES/DOS game, Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3D, which itself can be seen as a re-imagining of the earlier Jim Power In Mutant Planet for home computers. The Arcade Game is essentially the same game as Lost Dimension in 3D, however replaces the 3D/Mode 7 effects with 2D shoot-'em-up stages. There have also been numerous tweaks to make the game easier, as Jim Power games are notoriously difficult.

The game was cancelled due to Loriciel having financial troubles, however a prototype has since surfaced on the internet showing that Jim Power: The Arcade Game was very close to completion. There is only one music track in the game, which was intended for stage 3, however all the levels can be played and the game can be beaten.</desc>

    <desc>All the stars of the NFLPA are here - Aikman, Cunningham, Young, Elway, Irvin, Seau, Swilling and many more! Sensational new "Behind the QB" view gives you a total of six different perspectives. Improved passing game and new SPEED BURSTS combine for offensive fireworks. Great features include audibles, screen passes, 360-degree spins, diving catches, team playbooks, instant replays and more! Full 16 game '93 season, playoffs, and Super Bowl. Battery backup allows you to keep team standings plus track league leaders in passing, rushing, sacks, etc.

Gameplay:

After SEGA picked up the license and changed names with last year's edition, they ultimately decided to drop 'Sports Talk' for the simpler title "NFL Football". With over 800 players based on the 1992 season, all of the series trademarks including play-by-play commentary, authentic playbooks and instant replays are intact. Battery backup support is available for season play. This release features significant camera adjustments including a lower perspective and some enhanced zooming features which bring mixed reactions.

    <desc>Joe Montana II Sports Talk Football is the sequel to Joe Montana Football, released by Sega in 1991 exclusively on the Sega Mega Drive.

It has Joe Montana return as announcer, except this time, his announcements occur continuously in real time in accordance with the action, much as a real American football game would be, as opposed to the previous method of only having voice samples after plays (or in the case of other sports, hits, goals, etc.). The Sports Talk theme would follow in other Sega games, such as Sports Talk Baseball and this game's sequel, NFL Sports Talk Football '93 Starring Joe Montana, and would quickly become standard in both Sega's own games and everyone else's.</desc>

    <desc>Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba S.R, threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control, sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge of his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his Nuclear Weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious druglord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs.

Because of this threat, you're hired again to battle these two characters, following their paths in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Commache, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, you must take out their private army. Blow up the enemy with your hellfires, hydras, chain guns. Use the watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships. Pull off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side. Take out the evil duo and forever rid this threat.....in the jungle!

    <desc>The game situates itself on the "Isla Sorna" sites of Jurassic Park, a concept originally based on the Steven Spielberg series of movies. You play the role of a bounty hunter trying to catch some prized dinosaurs. This game is not a side scrolling platform game like the other two Jurassic Park games on the Genesis. This is a top-down view game like the SNES version of Jurassic Park, with gameplay similar to The Chaos Engine.

Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three missions. Once you have completed the three missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get two more final missions to complete the game.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Rampage Edition is faster, tougher and more dangerous than ever! Take up arms as Dr. Grant to blast through all-new action-packed levels or be a razor-clawed Raptor as you dodge the slashing jaws of the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! Man or beast, the goal is the same... escape the island alive before it blows!

Directions:

Grant - Collect dinosaur samples.

Raptor - GO AROUND RAISING HAVOC AND CHAOS! 

Gameplay:

Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition is the sequel to the first Jurassic Park game on Genesis and mostly looks and plays like the predecessor. It is also a side-scroller.

In this game you play as Dr. Grant. The big difference with the first game is that there are more enemies to defeat. In addition to the dinosaurs you have to defeat many InGen agents. The reason is that they are trying to recapture dinosaur DNA and eggs to build a new park or an army of dinosaurs.

Controls:

A Button: Switch weapons(Grant), Bite(Raptor)
B Button: Attack
C Button: Jump

Hints:

- T. Rex -
Don't try to kill T. Rex, it's impossible. Instead just slow him down enough to keep him from getting you.

    <desc>Darkseid attacks the planet Earth, destroying a military base in the process. A member of the Justice League (that the player chooses to play as) tracks down the other members for information and aid only be to attacked by those heroes in their related locations.

As the hero defeats the other JL members, they deduce that the others aren't the real leaguers. Coming to this conclusion, the hero battles Cheetah and then Despero for more information.

They both lead the hero to Darkseid, who then forces the hero to fight their android clone. Upon defeating the clone, the hero must face Darkseid himself.

After the hero defeats him, the other League members are freed, and the military base is restored.

    <desc>Kei is an incredibly powerful Japanese boxer. One day the Boss of the evil Kageki gang sees him in action. Impressed by Kei's pugilistic skills, the Boss asks him to be his right hand man in his organization. Kei, honorable guy that he is, boldly refuses. The Boss swears that he will not be spurned. A few days later, Kei's brother is beaten within an inch of his life. Knowing who is behind this brutal assault, Kei vows revenge.

Gameplay:

As Kei you must fight nine Kageki gang members and four underlings in a series of one-on-one fights before confronting the Boss himself. Your opponents vary in skill and abilities. For example: Ashpit is slow but can slap really hard, and Lizard is a dirty fighter who attacks using sandbags. As a boxer, your offensive moves are limited to a jab (left punch), a super jab (right punch), and a straight (right punch). You can also duck and jump. The action takes place in a garage, a gym, a machine room, a former night club, a fitness club, and other locations inside a high-rise building. Unlike most fighting games, Kageki is designed for only one player.

Controls:

Start: Pause
D-Pad: Move character in all directions
A Button: Jump
B Button: Jab, super jab
C Button: Straight punch
B &amp; C simultaneously: Duck

    <desc>Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.

The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.

Directions:

The object is to grab first place in order to grab top honors at the end.

Trivia:

The sequel, Kawasaki Caribbean Challenge, was apparently not released for the Genesis/Mega Drive. This entry uses the Domark F1 game engine.

    <desc>The third entry in the Kick Off series is the first that offers a isometric view instead of the old top-down view. In the game there are four competitions (World Cup Finals, League, Knock Out Cup and the challenge). There is several options for game speed and ball control to suit both novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has "key players", such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.

    <desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free. You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.

This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.

It was released in the US as Fatal Rewind This is the Japanese version released in 1993 with remixed baddies/level changes &amp; a nice intro missing from the US version.

The story of "King Colossus" is simple: you are a young fighter who lives in a small house somewhere on a fantasy continent and who was raised by the local wise man. Now, when he became skilled at sword fighting, the wise man sends him to the dangerous South Cave, to defeat the monsters populating it. By visiting different places, the hero will battle even more fearsome monsters, until he finally challenges the ultimate evil.

"King Colossus" is a top-down adventure with action combat and light RPG elements. You fight monsters by equipping weapons and swinging them in real time. There is a variety of accessories and items to find in the game, as well as different obstacles to overcome in the dungeons.

Translation Description:

A 100% complete English Genesis translation by our friends at MIJET. It works on a real Genesis and should have no known issues. They took this project very seriously and I expect you'll find this to be a top quality translation.

    <desc>For this game, there are three cameos from Street Fighter included (Ryu, Guile and Cammy). Also, like in some pirated fighting games, most of the character names are randomly screwed up. For example, Terry is known as "Treey" and Cammy as "Canme".

Another two things of this game is that each character seems to have a lot of health which is why it takes longer for the fight to end, and that there is a Game Over screen I haven't seen before.

Trivia:

Theme song is straight from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

    <desc>Alien super monsters have returned and are trying to invade Earth again! Now, Super Geon, Atomic Guy, and Cyber Woo must fight to retain control of the planet. Each one has special attacks and powers. Take on monsters that have unique abilities never seen before, including fire breath, aerial spins, and radioactive blasts. Challenge a friend, or have him help you out in the two-player option. Battle your way through seven levels of intense action in KING OF THE MONSTERS 2.

Gameplay:

The sequel to King of the Monsters, King of the Monsters 2 features more monsters, more levels, and a new type of character, the minor fighter aliens, who pester you as you do battle. As in the first game, you control a monster and you fight other monsters one at a time using methods from various wrestling and fighting games. The colorful variety of monsters includes Super Geon, a Godzilla look-alike; Atomic Guy, an armor-plated scientist; Cyber Woo, a super robot built for war; Huge Frogger, a reptilian alien; Eifflelyte, a fierce mutant warrior; Claw Head, a crabby fusion of an assortment of creatures; Beetle Master, a super insectoid; Aqua Slug, a slimy sea creature; and Lavicus, a levitating alien maker. While fighting monsters, you'll also have to ward off heavily armed humans who are trying to regain control of the Earth. They come at you in submarines, tanks, and fighter planes. As you work your way through the game, you'll fight in exotic locations such as the Grand Canyon, Tokyo, the desert, and France. A two-player mode allows you and a friend to each pick a monster and go at it head-to-head. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.

    <desc>Sometime in the future, the world devolves into a place where monsters rule supreme. After years of wreaking having on Earth, these so-called Super Monsters ask the existential question, "Which among us is the most powerful?" After years of fighting, four rise to prominence. 

Gameplay:

They are the superhero Astro Guy, whose Power Weapon is a Flash Wave; Godzilla-like Geon, who is deadly with a Flame Crusher; stone-faced Rockey, who crushes opponents with his Rockey Bomber; and slimy mutant Beetlemania, who attacks his foes with a Beetle Missile. To play this game, you choose one of these four monsters, using him to fight the rest of the monsters one at a time. 

In the two-player mode, you and a friend each choose a monster and fight each other. The two of you can also choose a favorite level: Megaport, Castle City, Dragon City, or Tokyo. Each level consists of two stages. While fighting a monster, you should be on the lookout for tanks, jets, battleships, and laser vehicles that will attack you from all sides. To defeat your opponent, you must weaken him and pin him down for a count of three.

    <desc>Maximus was a good king. His subjects were happy, businesses were successful, food was tasty, and all seemed right. Since he ruled over four continents with only his wise judgment and Scepter of Order, this was a considerable achievement. Little did the King know, however, that an evil creature named Arech Dragonbreath planned on stealing the scepter to throw the world into chaos.

One night while Maximus slept, Arech teleported inside the Royal Chambers and pulled the Scepter of Order from the King's grip. He then ordered his followers to attack the continents and take as much land as they desired. Meanwhile, Maximus grew seriously ill. It seems the Scepter's return will not only restore the kingdom to its former glory, but also save the King's life.

Arech shattered the magical instrument into 25 pieces, giving sixteen to evil nobles, one for himself, and scattering the remaining eight across the continents. This is where you come in. You'll need to save the dying king and four continents by retrieving all 25 parts of the Scepter of Order. Depending on the difficulty level you select, you'll either have 200, 400, 600 or 900 days to accomplish this.

The four characters you'll choose from include Sir Crimsaun the Knight, Lord Palmer the Paladin, Tynnestra the Sorceress, and Mad Moham the Barbarian. During your quest you'll be able to amass armies (depending on your character's leadership skills), siege castles, obtain contracts, fight turn-based battles and manage your weekly commission. Passwords will allow players to continue their game at any time.

    <desc>Klax is a straightforward puzzle game developed by the Tengen who licensed it from the Atari Games Corporation. Most remember it because of its edgy catch phrase, "It is the Nineties and there is time for Klax."

Basically, you have to clear the blocks while the fall which is called a Klax when you line up three of the same color vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The main difference from most puzzle games is that you can see more than one of them as they fall end over end down a slope.</desc>

    <desc>Lakers vs. Celtics is a basketball game featuring real NBA teams. Gameplay is action-oriented with an emphasis on offense. Play an exhibition game or try to win the NBA title in the playoff tournament mode. A season mode is not available. You can substitute tired players but there aren't any other management options.

The DOS version has ten '88-'89 NBA teams, including the East and West All-Stars. You can play with some of the biggest names in NBA history including Kareem, Bird, Jordan and Ewing. Several star players have their own signature move. 

The Genesis version, which was released one year later, has ten NBA teams from the '89-'90 season. It also adds more signature moves, different home- and away-jerseys, player portraits for the starting five, voice-samples for the referee and counts the number of personal fouls a players has committed.

Trivia:

- The Genesis version, which was released one year after the DOS version, isn't a port of the DOS version. It's almost a completely new game: it has new animations, sounds, graphics and adds player portraits. Moreover the DOS version has 10 1988-1989 teams while the rosters in the Genesis version are based on the 1989-1990 NBA season.

- '88-'89 was Kareem Abdul Jabbar's last season so unfortunately he and his famous skyhook move are left out of the Genesis version.

- While both versions are called Lakers vs. Celtics, it was actually the Detroit Pistons who won the NBA title in '88-'89 as well as '89-'90.

- This game is one of very few to have Michael Jordan playable in the Bulls' roster due to his expensive contract rights.

    <name>Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Landstalker is an action packed adventure, where you play Nigel, the Elf. You must search for the treasures of King Nole, and face many uncharted areas in your search for riches. Grab your sword and your booty bag, it's off to the island of Mercator to find the treasure. 

The legends of King Nole are known through out the land. Hundreds of years ago, the evil King swept across the continent, amassing hoardes of riches. Many treasure hunters have tried to find the large cache of jewels and other riches, but none have found anything. Returning to the city of Kalva with his latest find, Nigel is exuberant that it sold as well as it did. Planning to live on the coast for a while, he was taken by surprise when a tiny girl with wings and a forked tail sails into his backpack. She says she knows where the treasures are hidden, and is anxious to take you there.

Gameplay:

The player, as Nigel the treasure hunter, is tasked with searching for clues that lead to the treasure of King Nole. This is accomplished primarily by travelling through both outdoor areas and dungeons. All gameplay takes place in an isometric view, including plot-advancing scenes.

From the outset of the game, Nigel may walk, jump, swing his sword, talk to various non-player characters, and pick up and throw various objects. With very few exceptions, these basic actions do not change throughout the game, although Nigel's weapons and armor may be replaced with better versions thereof. There are a variety of items throughout the game, most of which are either restorative in nature or important to advancing the plot or solving puzzles.

The game's dungeons are filled with monsters, puzzles, and traps that require the player to jump from platform to platform. Locked doors inhibit the player's progress, and keys must be found to unlock them. The player has health which is kept track of by hearts; health and the maximum health limit may be increased with items purchased in towns or found in dungeons. The player is not prevented from revisiting old towns and dungeons, and is frequently required to do so to advance the plot.

Trivia:

- There was a scene cut out where Kayla is taking a bath. Nigel can either join or trying leave her, but in the end he will be beaten by Friday or Kaylas Henchmen.
- "Madam Yards Studio" (brothel) was renamed to "Ballet Studio" for NA and European territories.
- The Ending differs slightly from the American and European/Japanese ones. The original ending is that one where all the treasures are gone.
- In 2005, it was announced that Landstalker will be remade for the PlayStation Portable, but the release date was canceled. This game was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on September 3, 2007, and in Europe on October 5, 2007.

This game is what could be called a Shining Force clone, except that the series has been going on for a long time, spanning various consoles, and it's quite fun. It's also heavily story-driven, but unfortunately, I can't make up much of it because it's in Japanese.

It looks like Shining Force, it plays like Shining Force, but it's much deeper, since you control whole armies using a similar interface. It can get rather tedious, but if you have patience, you can master it.

Translation Description:

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive game Langrisser II. It is the sequel to Langrisser (known as Warsong in the USA) by Masaya. As usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it is capable of displaying the original Japanese script in addition to the English translation, depending on the country code of your machine.

It is loosely based on the older Hiryuu Honyaku / Warui Toransu translation. A few improvements to their original work were made by D et al. before he passed it off to M.I.J.E.T. Aside from the script and a few graphics, almost nothing was taken from the old release. The hacking was completely redone from scratch and is far superior. The script was almost entirely rewritten, edited, and type-set, with quite a bit of it retranslated. If you shied away from the older release, you may find that this version meets your standards.

    <desc>Danny Madigan is watching a sneak preview of the latest film of his favourite hero, Jack Slater, when he is mysteriously catapulted inside the screen; now standing next to his favourite idol. You are Jack Slater, an action movie hero, who takes on the ax maniac "The Ripper", who is holding a school under siege, and Benedict, a villain who wants to use Danny's ticket to bring terror to the real world.

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.

    <desc>Last Battle, known as Hokuto no Ken: Shin Seikimatsu Kyuuseishu Densetsu in Japan, is an action game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. As the Japanese name suggests, it was originally intended to be paired with the Japanese manga series, Hokuto no Ken, but the graphics were altered for a western release. In fact, it is a sequel to Hokuto no Ken, which was given the same treatment and sold as Black Belt overseas. It was a launch title for the console in North America.

The game was ported to the Amiga and Commodore 64 by Elite Systems in 1991.

The Japanese version of the game has since been re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

    <desc>Galahad travels through this platform adventure game, slashing up mutant creatures with a sword and battling the evil Thanatos in hopes to save the life of Princess Lucanna.

The controls are very simple and easy to understand - jump, walk or attack. Collect icons that will help in the enhancement of your armor, gain an extra life and coins to spend in the shop for new weapons. Be sure not to collect any skull icons or else it will call Thanatos' Ethereal Presence where you will have to use Rune Bombs to destroy it. After you complete one of the 3 worlds, you will be given a password so you can resume later after running out of lives.

Gameplay:

Galahad collects coins throughout each level, with which he can purchase armour, potions and new swords in a shop which appears infrequently during the game. The ultimate aim of each level is to find a certain object named at the start of level (with instructions where to find it). When Galahad finds it, he must find a portal which will lead him on to the next level. If he does not find the object, he cannot enter the portal.
Enemies encountered during the game range from dragons and elves to snakes and giant otters. At the end of each world, Galahad faces a gargantuan boss, whom he must defeat to enter the next world. The first version of this title was called Leander and was written by for the Amiga by Traveller's Tales for Psygnosis.

The Lemmings are in trouble and only their ancient talisman and a huge amount of skills can save them in this long-awaited follow-up to the Lemmings Saga.

Meet the Highland Lemmings, Space Lemmings, Beach-Bum Lemmings, Circus Lemmings and many, many more on a quest to save their island...

--from the cover of Lemmings 2: The Tribes

Gameplay:

This sequel to the overwhelmingly popular Lemmings game actually includes a storyline to go along with the puzzles. It seems the Lemmings of Lemming Island are split into twelve unique tribes, each with their own distinctive look and variety of special skills. Due to a mysterious catastrophe, the tribes must get back together and reassemble the Lemming Talisman which was split among them.

Your task is to get as many of each tribe as possible to the center of Lemming Island by navigating through several puzzles. Use their unique skills to overcome obstacles and avoid traps, saving as many of the Lemmings Tribes as possible.

    <desc>What is a Lemming?

Lemmings are actually very small rodents that live in Northern Europe. Every so many years an unusual event happens: The Lemmings population explodes and grows to immense proportions. At this time, the multitudes travel across vast spaces of land oblivious to any danger that may confront them. The Lemmings' only concern is to migrate forward, each following the next. Where are they going you ask? In an almost hypnotic state, they plunge, by the thousands, mindlessly into the sea towards certain annihilation.

This is your chance to play a part in a natural phenomenon and possibly help solve a puzzle which has baffled researchers for years.

Our Definition

lem-ming ('lem-ing): adorable yet incredibly stupid furry creatures, lost in a maze of confusion. Known for walking off cliffs, wandering aimlessly into dangerous passageways and drowning by the thousands in small pools of water. Without your help, they have no chance for survival.

Let's Go!

Lemmings may be mindless but are luckily equipped with special skills that you must assign to them so that they can travel safely through many dangerous terrains. An experienced player will know precisely where and when to assign these skills to the token Lemmings who will build a safe path towards an exit and save the rest of their buddies. Your success is measured by the percentage you save.

It will take all your brain power to rescue as many Lemmings as possible from impending doom! As you see hordes of these cute little fellows march to their sad fate, a guilty conscience is not the only thing you will develop--it's sure to become an addictive obsession!

--from the Genesis Lemmings game manual

Gameplay:

This is a really good game. The game might seem easy, but it takes a lot of thinking in the later levels. I prefer this version over the one on the SNES because it is closer to the original PC version. The game's music has the "springy" noise found in almost every Genesis game, unlike the SNES version.

Directions:

What they're trying to say in the manual is that you have to get those little green-haired Lemmings through an obstacle course to the exit before time runs out. The "special skills" are Blocker, Builder, Climber, Floater, Bomber, Basher, Miner, and Digger. Make sure they don't drown, fall, get burned, sliced, or smashed, depending on what's in the level.

    <desc>Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters is a 1994 arcade game that takes place in the American Old West. The object in the game is to shoot outlaws in order to eradicate crime from a stereotypical Old West town. Like in the original Lethal Enforcers, lives can be lost by shooting innocent civilians. The game was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and Sega CD.

Gameplay:

Lethal Enforcers 2 has five stages: "The Bank Robbery," "The Stage-Holdup," "Saloon Showdown," "The Train Robbery," and "The Hide-Out." During each stage, the player must shoot the armed outlaws without harming any innocent townsfolk (unlike the "bystanders" in the original 1992 arcade game) or fellow lawmen. One shot is usually enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a boss that must be defeated in order to complete the stage. Like the enemy bosses in the 1992 arcade game, they often shoot projectiles at the player.

In the game, the player's gun (a six-shooter) can carry up to 6 bullets. To reload, the player must aim his or her lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. In case of the Sega console versions, if a controller is used, the player only needs to press a specific button to reload.

At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent townsperson or lawmen is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continuous play is available.

There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Posse, Deputy, Sheriff, Deputy Marshal and U.S. Marshal. When the game begins, the player's rank is Sheriff, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted. On the SEGA Genesis, your accuracy for each stage corresponds to the rank you are given. 60%-69% will earn you the rank of Deputy. From 70%-79% is Sheriff. 80%-89% is Deputy Marshal and 90% or above is U.S. Marshal.

Additional weaponry can be found throughout the game that will give the player better firepower: 50 calibre sharps, rifles, double rigs, shotguns, gatling guns, and cannons. The gatling guns and cannons can each be used only once but the other four weapons can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If a player is shot while he or she has one of those weapons, however, they lose any special guns they have collected and will return to the regular gun.

In the arcade version, a DIP switch allows users to set the game to "Arcade Mode" or "Street Mode." In Arcade Mode, one assignment follows directly after the other where, between each assignment, there is a target practice session where the goal is to try to shoot all the required targets to improve the player's accuracy. Street Mode gives the player a choice of which stage they would like to go to, including a target practice stage.

    <desc>Lethal Enforcers is a 1992 shooting game released for the arcades by Konami. It is best known for its revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, its digitized graphics, and the controversy over its content.

Home versions were released for the Super NES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD during the following year. The home versions makes use of a revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, which came packaged with the game. A standard controller can be also used in lieu of the light gun in these versions. A second-player Justifier light gun, pink in color, was available only by mail order from Konami, and is very hard to find today.

Lethal Enforcers was followed by Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters, followed by the much different (and fully computer-generated) Lethal Enforcers 3. The game is also featured alongside Lethal Enforcers II in the two-in-one compilation Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II, released for the PlayStation in 1997.

Gameplay:

The player takes control of a police officer named "Don Marshall", who has been assigned to stop a growing crime wave that puts the city's security in jeopardy.

Lethal Enforcers has five stages or 'assignments': 'The Bank Robbery', 'Chinatown Assault' ("Downtown Assault" in Super Nintendo), 'The Hijackers', 'The Drug Dealers' ("The Gunrunners" in Super Nintendo), and 'The Chemical Plant'. During each stage, the player must shoot the armed criminals without harming any innocent bystanders or fellow officers. The innocents often warn the player of their presence with a plea of "Don't Shoot!", "Help Me!" or "I don't wanna die." If the player does hit one of them, the computer will issue an admonishment, "What are you doing?!" with an incredulous, rebuking tone, and forcing a life loss, but no removal of any special weapons.

One shot is usually enough to kill most enemies, announcing their appearance with "You missed me!", "You can't shoot me!", "You can't kill me", and "Eat Lead!". At the end of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to complete the assignment. Bosses often shoot projectiles at the player.

The player's gun can carry up to 6 bullets. To reload, the player must aim their lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. In case of the console versions, if a controller is used, the player only needs to press a specific button to reload.

At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent person or officer is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continuous play is available.

There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Patrolman, Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain and Commander. When the game begins, the player's rank is Detective, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted.

Additional weapons can be found throughout the game that will gives better firepower: automatics, Magnum bullets, rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers and machine guns. The grenade launchers and machine guns can each be used only once, but the automatics, the Magnum bullets, the rifles and the shotguns can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If the player is shot while they have one of those weapons, however, they lose any special guns they have collected and will return to the regular gun.

    <desc>LHX: Attack Chopper is a helicopter simulation with a strong arcade focus. You can freely choose which missions to fly first, and which helicopter to fly in a given mission. There are a total of four helicopters: Apache, Blackhawk, Osprey and LHX. With this fine selection of death machines you will engage countless enemy targets in Libya, East Germany and Vietnam throughout the game.

Trivia:

As of the year 2000, LHX is still the ONLY flight-sim that simulates the V-22 Osprey.

    <desc>Liberty or Death is a turn-based strategy video game for DOS, Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis released by Koei in 1993. Liberty or Death is part of Koei's Historical Simulation Series.

Gameplay:

The player can choose to control any of six Commanders-in-Chief, three each on the American Continental Army or British Army sides, during the American Revolutionary War.

For either side, the general objective is to eliminate all enemy troops throughout the Colonies by defeating them in battle. The strategies used to accomplish this change are based on which side you have chosen to play: the American side needs to hold out against the British and slowly gather its strength, while the British need to fortify their existing positions and quickly move against the Americans.

The gameplay focuses mainly on the military aspects of the conflict, but relationships with civilian, and particularly political, entities are of vital importance as their approval determines the budget for military spending, and in the worst-case scenario, they can vote for your ouster as C-in-C. Very historically accurate, the game faithfully reproduces the strategic situation of the war as well as many historical figures in great detail.

This game is known among players for its thoroughly researched historical detail, great complexity, level of difficulty, and the immense amount of time it takes to complete one game (similar to the experience of other Koei games). One could easily spend upwards of 250 hours on one game and might still be defeated in the end. The user interface showed many improvements over previous Koei games, including mouse support. The game can be played in one-player mode, two-player mode, or with two computer-generated players.

    <desc>This unreleased brawler by Ocean, settled up in the DC Comics' LOBO universe, actually reached end of development at Ocean of America. It was to be released for both the Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES in 1996, but the game was cancelled as a last minute decission and never saw the light of day for any platform.

    <desc>The Lost Vikings is a platform-puzzle game developed by Silicon &amp; Synapse (now Blizzard Entertainment) and published by Interplay for a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive.

The game follows three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, who have been plucked out of their own timezone by the evil Tomator, who is collecting lifeforms from all over the universe. It is up to the player to guide all three Vikings through various periods in time to get back to their ship. Each Viking has their own set of skills which are needed to progress through the stage. The player can only control one Viking at once, but can switch between them at any point and share items.

As the Sega Mega Drive version came slightly later than the others (1993 as opposed to 1992), it contains five stages not present in any other version. The music is also slightly different. The game is compatible with the 6-button gamepad and the Multi-tap, allowing for up to three players to play simultaneously.

The game was followed by The Lost Vikings 2: Norse by Norsewest which hit the Sega Saturn in 1997.</desc>

    <desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint. Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player

    <desc>Take the most powerful NATO tank, the M-1 Abrams, in 8 difficult missions against the Warsaw Pact forces. The four tank stations and the other aspects of the tank are quite nicely simulated, with different types of cannon rounds, coax machine guns, and all that. There's also the independent turret and track rotation commands. 

The controls are difficult at first But once you get that part down it gets pretty fun.

Directions:

You've got 3 different types of ammo, though I can't figure out how to switch between them &amp; There are separate controls for the tracks &amp; turret

Trivia:

This is the first game Dynamix tried (and applied) its proprietary 3D engine, which later caused so much excitement when used in Betrayal at Krondor.

Controls:

A Button: Fires the gun
B Button: Brings up the in-game menu
C Button: Hold to turn the turret independently
D-pad Left &amp; Right: Turn tank
D-pad Up and Down: Control the throttle

    <desc>John Madden Football, known as John Madden American Football in Europe, is an American football game developed by Park Place Productions and published by Electronic Arts. It is the second in the long line of Madden titles, which have been released annually since the creation of this game. The previous game, also called John Madden Football was released in 1988 and is largely unrelated to this one, aside from the similar themes.

John Madden Football for the Mega Drive can be seen as "Madden '91", being followed by John Madden Football '92, '93, '94 and so on. Every game has been named after John Madden, American football player, coach and commentator.

Electronic Arts reverse engineered the Sega Mega Drive in the hopes of selling the game in North America without having to pay royalties ($8-$10 USD per cartridge) to Sega. A proposal was then made to Sega that the fee be reduced to $2, with the overall fee not exceeding $2 million USD. Sega agreed due to fears EA would sell the information to other companies, and the process would reportedly save EA $35 million in the next three years.

John Madden Football was an enormous success for EA. Sega originally approached the company to sell it as Joe Montana Football, as their game was due to miss the 1990 Christmas shopping season, but were refused, instead being given a watered down engine for that game (which still proved successful). The first John Madden Football game is seen as an industry game changer - one of the first steps to take back market share from Nintendo in North America.

Elsewhere in the world, John Madden Football and its sequels have been less successful as the sport does not tend to resonate outside of the US, however EA has applied the annual release system to other sports titles, namely NHL, FIFA, PGA Tour Golf and NBA Live.</desc>

    <desc>Based on a popular manga comedy published in Shonen Jump, Magical Taruruuto-kun is about a boy named Edojou Honmaru who is constantly being bullied at school until he calls the titular hero Taruruuto from another world to help him. It is a cutesy platform game that plays similarly to most other games of its genre. There are many hazards to jump over and end of level boss fights, Taruruuto can hit enemies with his wand or pick up items and throw them.

    <desc>C&amp;E is a company you may have heard of before. It developed the RPG Beggar Prince, which was re-released by Super Fighter Team in 2006. For the NES, it made Mermaids of Atlantis, a game that was later licensed out and reworked into Bubble Bath Babes - a pornographic and ultr@ r@re unlicensed NES game. But, C&amp;E wanted a decent version of the game, so it made a 16-bit version itself. It was for the Sega Mega Drive of course, and the game was this time called Magic Bubble.

The story involves a mysterious nacre who creates magical bubbles of different colours. They can release oxygen to the creatures of the sea, but only if four of the same colour are grouped together. "The naughty bubbles" refuse to do that because an evil goddess controls them. However, YOU can use your control to prevent this and have the creatures of the sea get their precious oxygen.

If you have played any game from the Puyo Puyo or Columns franchises, then there should be no trouble for you to play Magic Bubble. Four bubbles of up to five different colours float upwards. Have four of the same colour link to each other, and they will disappear. What makes the gameplay much harder than, for example, Columns is that the bubbles don't continue to rise if there is space between them and other bubbles or the top. Instead, transparent bubbles take their place. They are hard to remove, but one solution is to sneak the regular bubbles inside them, when possible. The bubbles come in odd formations, making it challenging to flip them and putting them at the right spot. But that is mostly just part of the fun for me. Like in most of these kind of games, the game ends when the entrance for new bubbles is blocked.

There are three modes of play. In Type A, for every two hundred bubbles you pop the level changes, which means the bubbles will rise faster from now on. Occasionally, bubbles with the letters M, A, G, I and G come individually. When all of them are popped, you get a magic, which lets a nice fish pop all transparent bubbles for you. There might also come a shining bubble, and if you pop that one, you will reach a simple bonus level. After many levels, the game ends. In Type B, there is a shining bubble at the top. Your aim is to pop that bubble in order to beat the level. This type is a lot harder than the previous one, simply because there is no magic and you play against time. You might recognize it from other puzzle games. Type C is a versus mode, against the computer or your friend. Your play area here is smaller to fit both opponents.

After twenty bubbles popped, you get an attack. The attack moves your top two rows of bubbles to the field of the other player. The attack system doesn't work too well. It might lead to an attack war between the two players, so you have to be strategic when to use them. This mode consists of up to five rounds. I highly prefer the calm and easy gameplay of Type A, but Type C with a friend is a nice alternative if you've gotten tired of Puyo Puyo. All in all, I would say Magic Bubble suits well to pick up a rainy day where you want something only a little tricky for your mind.

C&amp;E put a lot of care into the design of this game. The fish and other creatures that roam around the screen when you play are not just made up by the designers. No, they exist in reality and look very well drawn and animated. C&amp;E even consulted an expert advisor for this. The rest of the graphical content isn't much to talk about. The bubbles look like you would expect them when you play, and that is just fine. There is also an introduction screen with some dancing bubbles which is mildly amusing.

I really like the music in Magic Bubble. It consists of soft, calm piano ballads that sound both happy and sad at the same time for some reason. There is a special feel to the music that fits perfectly for the aquatic theme. For an unlicensed game, the sound production is far better than for example the load of GEMS crap that plagued the console. There are some voice samples which are of average quality for the console in mind. For the sound effects, there isn't anything special. I just hate the "attack" sound in Type C, it is so irritating.

Magic Bubble is a nice little game. While it isn't too original, at least it has a very atmospheric audio-visual appearance that boosts the experience of it. There is not a lot of content, where the half-assed graphics take the biggest hit. But then again, what can you expect from a puzzle game? Three modes, four difficulty settings and two player option is well enough to grant this a purchase, especially when the game is fun to play. Unfortunately, it comes in a cardboard box which is quite ugly and might be in very bad shape if you manage to find the game. Even though it was completely in English, tracking it down in the western world is still very hard. Let's hope Super Fighter Team re-releases the game with the few enhancements it needs so everyone can get some bubble love!

    <desc>I've lost my marbles. Well, play this game and you'll never lose them again. This rolly polly puzzle game will have you playing for hours, just moving your marbles around on raised platforms, ramps, and tubes.

This game is the remake from the NES game Marble Madness. The interface was pretty much the same, although the graphics and music are much better in that there is more detail on the marble and the course, not to mention that the music is more grooving than the 8-bit sound from the NES game. This game is a fun way to spend hours just rolling around the puzzle course trying to get your marbles in the hole.

Directions:

Move your marble around with the directional pad to get it to the goal at the end of the course. However, due to the angle of the view the directions are front, back, left and right rather than up, down, left and right.

Or, if you switch the Control to Grid Mode, the directions are all set to diagonals, which just makes things confusing and difficult, so don't do that. The course is laid out with arrows that help direct you to the end.

If you fall off the edge or into a pit of spikes, your marble will die. Don't forget there are other things to worry about than just ramps and falls, you also have to worry about other marbles, jumping tubes, and other enemies trying to stop you. Don't die too many times or the game will be over.

Controls:

D-Pad: Guide marble through the course.
A, B, C: You don't need the buttons in this game.
Start Button: Pause

    <desc>Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most successful racing drivers in the US scene, and five of his relatives have also raced professionally. This game allows you to sample Indy cars, stock cars and sprint cars, all of which have been graced by Andrettis. The physics are customized to each of these, so expect sprint cars to slide around on the dirt tracks, and the slipstream effect is detectable.

There are 27 computer-controlled cars with individual profiles, and 8 cars to choose from in each race, with varying engine, grip, brakes and pit crew standards. You can view the action either from behind the car, or from the nose. In longer races you must monitor the pit strategy, with the options of a splash 'n' dash stop if your tires are still fine.

Check him out... Mario rips towards you. Check him into the glass. Nab the puck. Pass to an open winger for the give-&amp;-go. Then break free at mid-ice to connect. And slam home a 90mph slapshot. It's life-sized, gut-tightening action. He steals the puck, turns it up ice. You unload a body-crushing check. He drops his gloves... It's a fight! A jab. An uppercut. A roundhouse. And there's the whistle! Lose, and you chill out in the penalty box. Play on one of 16 fast and furious teams from Montreal to L.A. Pull from three sets of frontliners. Between periods, flip through 14 pages of hot stats. Major stuff. Major mayhem. After all, you're playing with Mario Lemieux!

    <desc>Colonel Brown, the evil owner of a toy factory, has created a substance that can turn people and animals into mutant sludge monsters. When Marko's football comes in touch with the substance it gets magical powers, giving Marko the power to stop Colonel Brown.

Now Marko has to find his way through numerous platform levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Using his magic football, he can perform various moves and attacks. He can kill his enemies with different kicks, header shots or even bicycle kicks and also use his ball as a trampoline. 

The SNES version features two additional moves for Marko (the ability to balance on the ball and a different method of returning it to him), but they do not have a great impact on gameplay.

    <desc>Based on the character developed by Belgian cartoon artist Franquin, this platform features the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange animal with a large tail, who was poached along with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends No?, Bip and Sarah tries to return to Palombia.

While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it includes a twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the Earthworm Jim levels where Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other enemies away, but also to change Bonelli's direction. The player also collects fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the player can't make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally available.

    <desc>In 1989, Namco released an arcade game called Marvel Land. The game featured beautiful graphics and platforming elements while you take the role of a dragon man, as he sets out on a journey to save the amusement park Marvel Land. Since arcade games were designed to eat as many of your coins as possible, Marvel Land has very high difficulty and longetivity, so it's unlikely someone will finish this game in one sitting (especially when in an arcade).

Trivia:

The European port was re-titled Talmit's Adventure.

    <desc>Based of the 1994 movie remake of Frankenstein, you play as the artificial man created by Victor Frankenstein. After Victor rejects you due to your hideous appearance, you flee from Victor and you swear your revenge on him.

You go through a number of levels battling anything that attacks you with your wooden stick. You can light the tip of the stick on fire if you swing it at fire which are always located a wall. You can use a special attack too on your attackers which The Creature holds up his hands and a blue ball comes out when you release the button. That takes some of your life away. You have to solve some simple puzzles in order to get through the level as well.

    <desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak.
Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.

Trivia:

Master of Monsters is in fact a fantasy spin-off of Systemsoft's more successful Daisenryaku series, with military units replaced by monsters and cities replaced by warlocks and towers.

Hints:

    <desc>Master of Weapon is a game released by Taito for arcades and for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It is a basic shoot 'em up game in which the player controls a space ship that has upgradeable weapons. These upgrades are collected by destroying green transport vessels which release the upgrade for the player to pick up.

Gameplay:

The spaceship starts with a basic photon cannon and air-to-ground bombs. Both of these weapons can fire continuously without a need for pause. The photon cannon can be upgraded five times for up to five streams of photons by collecting P upgrades. Additionally, the exhaust of the ship can be used as a weapon.

Special Weapons

Special weapons can be collected by picking up boxes with specific labels through destroying transport vessels.
P- Pier- Essentially the same as the conventional air-to-ground bomb. This is the default special weapon.
L- Laser- Very powerful but has a short range. It can attack both air and ground targets.
G- Guide- Shoots several green projectiles that track all targets on screen, self-destruct, and destroy the target.
W- Wide- a somewhat powerful launch of several projectiles in a star pattern.
H- H-Bomb- destroys all enemies on the screen for a few seconds. Can only be used once.
S- Increases the exhaust of the ship, allows it to damage enemies at a further range and increases movement speed of the ship.

    <desc>A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn maths while having fun.

The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).

Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.

The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.

The activities are as follows:
Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.

Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.

Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.

Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.
Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.

    <desc>The story takes place in 1999 where a Bio-Beast by the name of Godkaiser Hell has reigned supreme over Earth, after a nuclear and biological holocaust has disfigured most of the population and formed an army called the Steelmask Force. The survivors have fled underground and are constantly attacked by the Bio-Beast horde until one day a scientist by the name of Dr. Kabuto creates a mech, the Mazinger-Z, that can be used against the monsters. This is where the player takes control of the games protagonist and pilots the suit in an attempt to reclaim the Earth.

The gameplay is a hack-n-slash game, where the player controls the suit by using the D-pad and using the face buttons to slash at enemy monsters. There is also a Super Attack that the player can use, but it will decrease their health after each use. The enemies consist of mutant animals such as dogs and beetles as well as the Bio-Beast soldiers that can range from regular soldiers, female fighters and even ninjas.

There are five levels in all (Tokyo, Asia, Europe, New York and Egypt) divided into three stages with a mini-boss and a main boss the player must defeat to advance to the next level. There are also items scattered throughout the levels that will give the player extra points, health refills, an extra life and even a brief stint of invincibility.

Hints:

Fight the Bosses:
In the game option screen, highlight Sound test, select Sound 18. The choose Sound effect test option and select Sound 72. Exit out of the sound mode and press start. This trick will allow you to fight the bosses without fighting through the levels.

    <desc>This is the original Bomberman game for the Genesis. According to Eidolon, Factor 5 was asked to do a Genesis port of Bomberman and came up with this 8-player version that used multiple joystick port adaptors. Hudson was impressed, but decided in favor of licensing a local Japanese company instead.

Eight players on the Genesis is impressive enough, and the trademark frantic gameplay is still there! This game's a riot! Compared to this, Mega Bomberman seems rather stilted and awkward.

Trivia:

Also known as the Bomberman Eight Player Hack. I also note in passing that although it was never commercially released, this "ROM" demo is still covered by Hudson's copyright on the Bomberman franchise.

    <desc>BOOM! Here it is! This frantic arcade classic is a guaranteed blast. Bomb your way around scrolling mazes collecting power-ups in search of the magical locket. Or plug-in up to 4 Players to unleash a hugely addictive blast-a-thon of multiplay mayhem! 

--from the back cover of Mega Bomberman for Genesis

The game intro shows the Earth being broken into five pieces. The point of the game is to gain pieces of medallions by defeating all enemies in every world. When you collect all the pieces, you then fight a boss (by blowing him up, obviously). When you defeat him, that slice of the world will return to where it should be.

The graphics are fun and bright. This is much more fun to look at than the original Bomberman, though perhaps a bit more difficult to control. The music is more sophisticated than the original Bomberman as well, but I must say I loved that corny old music. Still, this music isn't bad.

Directions:

This Bomberman is very different from the original. You get harder baddies, kangaroos to ride on, bosses, and if you have any blocks left that could have been blown up at the end of the stage you get 15 seconds to go collect the coins they turn into (no worries, you don't have to make it back to the exit).

If it was a split level where you left one room and went into another but still had the same time limit, you won't be able to go back and get coins from blocks left in the other rooms. You can only collect coins in the room with the exit ramp. The coins are worth 500 points a piece.

In addition to the usual Bomberman goodies (power-ups that give you more bombs, bigger blasts, more speed, etc.) in this game you can find eggs. These strange, differently colored little kangaroos come out of the eggs, and you jump on their back. They allow you to do different things (being able to get hit once and only lose the 'roo instead of a life is the handiest). Press the B button while on your 'roo to see what it can do. Some kick bombs and some kick baddies, but that's not all they do.

As always, you can detonate your bombs remotely if, and only if, you have picked up the power-up that looks like a heart with a bomb in it.

Blow up the grey globes on pedestals to break the glass covering the piece of medallion. Run up the ramp and get it before time runs out. If you run out of time you will have to start the level over (unlike the original Bomberman in which red coins came out that were very hard to kill or avoid). Also unlike the original Bomberman, you can bomb the exit without consequences (no harder enemies will appear) and the only bad thing that happens when you bomb a power up is it vanishes.

Play with friends and blow each other up!

Controls:

A Button: Remote Detonate Bombs
B Button: Use Kangaroo Power
C Button: Place a Bomb
Start Button: Start Game/Pause

Hints:

Can't get out?
In the third stage of the very first world, you may find yourself stuck. The exit can be very difficult to spot. The exit is located in the top portion of the right arm of this cross-shaped stage. It's a slightly darker round area in the jungle around you. When you go through, there's more of Stage Three on the other side!

Final area
Put in the password 0515 to get to the Final Area.

This game is very special in the fact that it hosts the first three Mega Man games, and the fact that each game has new surprises throughout the levels. The graphics are far superior to those that are found on its NES counterparts, and the game play has taken a step up. The music has stayed the same as far as the classic Mega Man theme song goes, but it is a bit sharper thanks to the sixteen bit processor. Well, this is a true classic holding many enjoyable hours of game play within its small cartridge. So have fun with this remade classic, Mega Man: the Wily Wars.

    <desc>MegaPanel is a 1990 Puzzle game produced by Namco for the Sega Mega Drive. It was a Japanese only release.

Gameplay:

Overall at a quick glance Megapanel is similar to Tetris. The player must reconfigure coloured blocks that slowly scroll onto the screen, for them to be grouped in sets of the same colour, at which the blocks disappear and points are gained. However there are some major differences that gives the game credibility and separates itself out from been a "Tetris clone."

Instead of the blocks been made up of 3 or 4 squares arranged into various shapes, they are all the same shape, a simple square. Their only variable is the difference in colour. Much like some jigsaw puzzle games, there is one empty square on the screen, at which the player can slide the blocks around one at a time in attempt at getting them to be arranged into 3 colour long strings (vertically or horizontally). The blocks themselves also appear as 1 complete row from the bottom of the screen, rather than the top.

Like Tetris, the player attempts to keep the blocks from reaching the top of the screen before the various required goals are achieved. If that does happen, the player loses a life and has to start the level again. If the player loses all three lives then the game is over.

    <desc>A secret underground race on an island in the Atlantic ocean has stolen top military vehicles and equipment from around the world and have rebuilt powerful war machines from them. They are even piloted by robots with one mission: to destroy. Military and intelligence officials of major countries have detected them, but they are afraid that they will be unable to prepare against an assault by this underground race. Their plan is to send you in to infiltrate their base and destroy them before they have a chance to unleash the war upon the rest of the world.

You can choose to control either the Helicopter or the Jeep, which have different advantages -- for instance, the Helicopter is not stopped by obstacles but the Jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting specials) you can pick up along the way to help you destroy the enemy.

Trivia:

- The game was also released on the SNES as Super SWIV (Europe) and Firepower 2000 (USA), and on various home computer formats as SWIV.

- The music used for boss battles and the entire final level of the SNES version is lifted from a scene in the film "The Terminator" where Reese and a female fellow Tech-Com soldier engage an HK tank.

    <desc>Mega Turrican is a 16-bit shooter game, developed by Factor 5, and marketed in 1995 by Data East. This game of the Turrican series was initially designed for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and later followed by an Amiga port under the title of Turrican 3. However, despite not being the original, the Amiga version was the one that was first commercially released in 1993, published by Rainbow Arts in Germany and Renegade in Europe. The Mega Drive version didn't have a publisher and stayed unreleased until 1994, when Data East carried over its worldwide distribution. Data East itself released the game in North America, and contracted Sony Imagesoft for its distribution in Europe.

The Mega Drive version of the game was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on March 22, 2008 and on April 14, 2008 in North America.

After many generations of peace, the Dark Forces have assembled again, and as Bren McGuire, a member of the USS Freedom Forces, it is your job to defeat them once again. In the future, mankind will have to deal with many powerful alien species - not all of whom will choose to be friendly. That is the reason behind the Turrican suit - a one-man set of power armor that turns any Earth Force soldier into a nearly unstoppable killing machine.

Gameplay:

The player has to complete numerous large levels always searching for secrets to pick up and enemies to shoot. To do this, you can pick up three different, upgradeable shots: a "Multiple" spread gun, a more powerful, single-direction "Laser" and a "Rebound", which fires shots directly up and down that travel along floors and ceilings, while the main forward-firing shot is weaker. You can also go into wheel-mode by pressing jump whilst holding down on the D-Pad (as long as you have enough special energy) and use a rope. In wheel-mode, you are nearly invincible and can lay mines or explore previously unreachable areas, a mechanic similar to "Morph Ball" from the Metroid series and the "Spin Dash" from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

Development

The German magazine "Amiga Games" published a complete 6 part development diary (The long way from Turrican 2 to Turrican 3) in 1992.

Factor 5 began the work on Turrican 3 for the Amiga right after Turrican II was released in 1991. They had a working demo that already had some features from the final game. However, around this time, the Amiga market was already in decline and together with Rainbow Arts, it was decided to develop the game for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was completely redesigned for the console and it was co-developed by Factor 5 and members of Kaiko. Kaiko then approached Rainbow Arts and asked to develop their own version of Turrican 3 for the Amiga. However, development on this version did not get very far and was stopped after a short time. Development on the Amiga version was restarted, this time as a conversion of the Mega Drive game. The programming was done by Peter Thierolf, formerly of Kaiko (the company was falling apart at the time).

Turrican 3 for the Amiga was finally released in 1993, and even though Mega Turrican for the Mega Drive was finished earlier, its release had to be delayed due to the fact of Factor 5 not having a proper publisher for it. Data East finally published it in 1994.

The main differences between the versions are graphics (the 64 colours of the Mega Drive version had to be downconverted to 32 for the Amiga) and sound (the Amiga had the more advanced sound hardware and thus the music tracks sound more impressive on it). The main gameplay difference is that a secret level in Mega Turrican became a regular level in Turrican 3. In general terms, the game features much smaller levels to the original Amiga Turrican games and has much chunkier sprites, but compensates these with many new effects and graphical improvements, and a major focus on shooting action. The lightning whip from the first two games is gone and is replaced by a grappling hook.

    <desc>Terrorists have their job and you've got yours: CRUSH 'EM ALL! They've kidnapped a former President, and the MERCS are going in for the rescue. Punch through their coastal defenses, snatch enemy weapons and gain firepower. Pick up machine guns, bazookas and heavy artilery as you advance through the smoke of burning metal. Power up a flame thrower, and good-bye, Charlie! Push through a non-stop barrage of lead, grenades, heat seeking missiles and attack choppers. Hijack tanks and gunboats. Shred 'em with their own weapons! They messed with your country - now you're gonna make 'em scream!

Gameplay:

The Mega Drive port of Mercs featured two modes, an arcade mode, which mirrored the arcade release of the game, where the player had one "Merc" (soldier) who could pick up a variety of different weapons throughout the game; and an "original" mode, which included multiple playable characters, each with their own unique weapon. In both modes, the aim was to fight through the levels, defeating each boss at the end of every level.

Although the game is officially the sequel to Commando, the plot makes no connections to the first game. The forthcoming Bionic Commando sequel identifies the returning character of "Super Joe" (who was also the player's character in Commando) as Joseph Gibson, the Player 1 character from Mercs, essentially tying the two games together.

    <desc>Moonwalker is pretty much based on the Michael Jackson movie. Mr. Big has kidnapped the children and has nasty things in store for them, like drugging them and making them slaves. It's up to Michael to use his powers and save his little friends.

MJ can jump, throw magical stars and dance to counter his opponents as he looks for the hidden children. Stages come in shape of some of MJ's videos like streets and graveyards. There are also caves and a final showdown in space as a robot.

Hints:

- Level Select -
Hold Up/Left and A on controller 2. Press start at the title screen with the 1 player controller to start a one player game. The phrase round one will appear on the screen. Press left or right to change rounds and then press start to play.

- Play as a Robot -
In level 5-2, walk up the pair of steps where you first start off. walk to the right until you see the first opening &amp; closing drop .fall through and hold right to land on the surface under it. after that, open the door and rescue child. Then go all the way to the left where you first were but move to the right side of the box door. wait for the star to come and jump up to get it.

Note: This must be the first child rescued in this level.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Mickey Mouse gets a chance to go down memory lane and walk through the timeless adventures he has lived. Mickey Mania is a platformer where all the levels are based on Mickey's most famous cartoons. The levels range about 75 years, starting off with "Steamboat Willie" and going all the way to "The Prince and the Pauper".

Gameplay:

Like many other games of its genre, the player takes the role of Mickey and progresses through each level, defeating enemies in the way and solving the occasional puzzle. Most enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or throwing marbles at them. Frequently, the player must jump from platform to platform to advance, sometimes with a time limit (such as escaping a collapsing tower).

Trivia:

The four versions of the game differ greatly from each other. The Super NES version is missing the Band Concert level and the staircase sequence in the Mad Doctor level, as well as a few special effects and some of Pluto's appearances. It also adds loading screens between each area. In contrast, the Sega CD and Playstation versions add a sequence near the end of the Prince and the Pauper level where Mickey must find pencils to call the other Mickeys from the six main levels to attack Pete, as well as giving Mickey extensive dialogue relevant to situations throughout the game. The Playstation version, meanwhile, enhances the graphics and adds a sequence at the end of the Mickey and the Beanstalk level where Mickey must run away from Willie the Giant (Willie makes no appearance in any of the other versions despite being mentioned in the manuals of all four versions).

    <desc>Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse is a platform game developed by Sega AM7 for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. It was the first in a series of Disney games exclusive to Sega consoles.

Castle of Illusion was one of Sega's first big exclusives, and was promoted heavily to sell consoles before the release of Sonic the Hedgehog. It would later be followed by World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The Game Gear and Master System versions are slightly different in design, and though feature the same level themes, have different gameplay mechanics and simpler graphics/sound. These versions would be followed by Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse.

The game was bundled with Quackshot later in the Mega Drive's life, and also appeared with this game in a Sega Saturn collection.</desc>

    <desc>World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck is a Mega Drive/Genesis video game that was produced by Sega of America and released in 1992.

It is a semi-sequel to the previous games that Sega produced based on Walt Disney cartoon characters. In the game, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home. In Japan the title of the game was, Alive! Mickey &amp; Donald: Fushigi na Magic Box.

Gameplay:

The game's music, artwork and animation shows influences from classic Disney animated films, including; Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, The Sword in the Stone, Alice in Wonderland and Pinocchio. While often mistaken for a similar platform based video game, this game had many features that broke the mold.

The gameplay changes slightly depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.

Magic Spells

Along the way, Mickey and Donald learn new magic to perform in later levels.

- Magic Carpet (Level 1): Allowed Mickey and Donald to fly on a magic carpet in level 2.
- Underwater Bubble (Level 2): Allowed Mickey and Donald to breathe underwater.
- Magic Box Transportation (Level 3): Mickey and Donald could transport to different places using magic boxes.
- Card Control (Level 4) Mickey and Donald put certain large playing cards under their control, making a bridge or a pathway to the other side of a large gap.

    <desc>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.

Gameplay:

First, you choose whether to play as Mickey or Minnie, and then you choose from three difficulty levels. The player then learns of trouble in Beanswick. There is a strange rumbling over the castle and no one can explain it. Mickey (or Minnie) volunteers to investigate. He must go through a series of challenges in various rooms of the castle in order to collect magic beans and items. These tasks can be completed in any order, but all must be finished to beat the game.

Sorting Books

Books are floating up and down in the library of the Beanswick castle and Mickey must sort them in alphabetical order by jumping on them. Depending on difficulty, there are various numbers of books to be sorted and different patterns for the books to float in. Only a portion of the alphabet must be sorted. Once the books have been sorted, you receive an item.

Moving Potions

Mickey is transformed into a tiny size and placed on a chess-like game board. Potion bottles are on this board, as well as block obstacles that must be maneuvered around. The potion bottles are to be pushed into a magic mirror on the board. In harder difficluty games, there are more boards to play in increasing difficulty. Once all potions have been collected, you return to normal size and receive your item.

Picture Matching

This is a timed, memory challenge. Mickey must dust off portraits hanging on the castle walls in matching pairs. Basically, it's the matching card game. He must complete this task before the lights in the castle dim to darkness. Depending on difficulty, there are more or less pictures. For challenges with more pictures, more time is given. He is armed with a feather duster and sliding ladder. Match up all the pictures before time and light run out to receive item.

Playing the Pipes

This is a memory game. Several pipes light up and make different noises in a pattern that builds every turn. Mickey must listen, remember, and repeat what he heard. He can do this by jumping on the top of the pipes and playing the notes back in the proper order. The pipes only play one melody, adding one note after every time Mickey successfully completes the previous one. Difficulty of gameplay determines the length of the melody. Play all the right pipes to receive the item.

Guess the Tools

Goofy wants Mickey to guess what tools are in his toolbox. Mickey has seven attempts to successfully guess the tools and their order inside Goofy's toolbox. After each guess, a clue appears telling you how many and which tools you guessed in the correct order. In easier games, the tools turn red or green to denote correctness. In more difficult games, a small quartered square of red and green pieces tells Mickey which ones are right. Correctly guess what is in Goofy's toolbox to earn your item.

Exchanging Items

This is the segue of the game. The items Mickey collected were of no importance to their previous owners, but would serve useful to others in Beanswick. Mickey must go back to all of the others in each challenge and give them the item that suits them. In return for each correctly placed item, Mickey receives a magic bean. Only after retrieving all five beans can Mickey use them.

Using the Magic beans

After returning the items to their respective owners, Mickey visits the well. The annoying rumbling occurs again and Mickey throws his beans near the well. Suddenly, a giant beanstalk grows straight up into the clouds. A curious Mickey climbs the beanstalk into the clouds and encounters a giant. The giant is sound asleep and snoring. This massive snoring is the cause of all the trouble for Beanswick. There is a scrambled picture of an alarm clock floating next to the giant. Mickey must unscramble the picture by sliding the pieces and wake up the giant. After Mickey wakes up and talks to the giant, the troubles in Beanswick are solved.

Trivia:

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge's plot resembles bits of several fairytales, such as Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk.
Because of its simplistic gameplay, graphics, and lack of depth, this has been noted as one of the worst games made for Super NES.
Horace Horsecollar in the game is dressed as he was in The Prince and the Pauper

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Global Gladiators (also known as Mick and Mack: Global Gladiators) is a 1992 platform game by Virgin Interactive, originally programmed by David Perry for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and eventually ported by other Virgin Interactive teams to the Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear and the Commodore Amiga. A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message.

A Gameboy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port.

Gameplay:

In the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance.
They are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles.

The game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment.

Hints:

- Cheat Menu -
Press [C, B, A, Start] four times at the Sega logo to display the cheat menu screen.

- Extra Lives -
Pause game play and press A three times, B three times, C four times, B, and then A.

- Level Select -
Pause the game and press B, C, B, A, B, B, C, B, A, and B.

    <desc>The second game of the Micro Machines series. Like in its predecessor, you behind the steering wheel of an extremely small car. You race around on interesting places, like a table, a treehouse and many more. The control of the cars is sometimes quite difficult, especially if you don't know the tracks (the top-down view is not very clear). The CD-ROM version additionally features CD-Audio music and a track editor.

    <desc>This entry in the Micro Machines series flirts with a military theme. Using a top-down view, you race on different scaled-down tracks such as a pond, a kitchen table, a workbench, in the garden, .... The theme is reflected in the vehicles (helicopters, speedboats, tanks, supply trucks...), as well as in the music.

Up to 16 players can participate through the hot-seat party mode, but 8 racers can race simultaneously using the J-Cart and by sharing a part of the joypad. There are different game types, such as regular races (challenges), time trials, and battle arenas, in which you have to survive for a set amount of time while enemy vehicles charge. Other players can be shot to slow them down.

    <desc>Micro Machines: Turbo Tournament 96 is a sequel to Micro Machines 2 and although the gameplay and the typical top-down view still remain the same, this fun racing game offers a great number of new features.

Besides Challenge-Race, Head to Head-Race, League-Race, Time Trial Challenge-Race and Time Trial-Race, an outstanding Multiplayer Mode is included with the J-Cart. Just plug two additional joypads into the cartridge slots and up to 8 (!) players can race simultaneously on the same track (always two players sharing one pad). With an included Construction Kit, you can even create own tracks and store them. Up to nine tracks can be saved.

    <desc>Choose your vehicle and go! 27 fantastic circuits, Race Performance sports cars, Power boats, Helicopters, Formula One racing cars, Combat tanks, Highway warriors, 4 x 4's, Monster Trucks and Turbo wheels! Superb playability! Fast, furious, unstoppable racing action!

Gameplay:

Micro Machines on the Genesis was the same as it was on the NES, except the graphics were better. It's a lot like RC Pro AM in the way that it is played. The biggest difference was that you got to choose your own opponents. There were also a lot of different vehicles you could race, instead of just cars. Micro Machines were really big when I was a kid. I only had a couple, but a few of my buddies had a ton! I think the most memorable thing about Micro Machines is the guy on their old commercials that talked really fast. He was crazy. Micro Machines is a whole lot of fun, so give it a try! 

Directions:

Race against other Micro Machines in order to expand your collection.

Controls:

A Button: Gas
B Button: Brake
C Button: None
Start Button: Start/Pause

Hints:

- Shortcuts -
Be careful when taking shortcuts, if you cut too much of the track, the game will blow you up when you try to get back on track.

    <desc>The Midnight Resistance fighters are up against the awesome powers of mad scientist King Crimson and his Crimson Corps. Crimson has kidnapped your scientist grandfather and five more of your relatives, and aims to put his advanced plans to evil use.

Take control of a Resistance fighter in this scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of nine platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun bays en route. 

Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in at shop points for weapons. These weapons include machine guns and flamethrowers, for which ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded when you have no suitable ammo. The control system is unusual - you can shoot in different directions and crawl along low ledges.

Hints:

- Level Skip -
While you're at the title screen, highlight "Start Game", then hold C and press Start. Next, at any time during gameplay, pause the game and press A to go to the next level.

    <desc>Throughout the Cold War, little was known of the Soviet MiG fighter jets. The only thing the United States knew was that the MiG-29 was the world's most effective fighter. Now that the Cold War is over, you have the chance to be your very own Mig-29 Fighter Pilot and see what you were missing. The first thing you'll want to do is to get familiar with your new jet in the training missions. Once you feel ready for action, you can take on any of the five combat missions in the Middle East. As you engage in dogfights at speeds in excess of Mach 1, remember to keep an eye on your g-forces the last thing you want to do is black out and crash! With working instruments in the cockpit, realistic flight physics, and intense combat action, Mig-29 Fighter Pilot is the ultimate flight simulation.

    <desc>The third installment of the roleplaying series, with a multi-faceted plot full of twists and turns. Ease of use was central to the gameplay and interface, and the plot included piles of new twists and turns.

Lead a party of adventurers to rendezvous with the legendary wizard Corak. From dark moldy dungeons, through corridors of hewn stone and timber, and onward to the lofty frozen peaks of Terra you will uncover the mysteries that surround the exotic islands in the Great Sea.

Trivia:

In various dungeons in the game you are given Quatloo coins that you can spend in the Slithercult stronghold; quatloos are the coins used for placing bets on Star Trek crew members in the original Star Trek episode "The Gamesters of Triskelon".

    <desc>The Sequel to the successful Might and Magic I, it boasted better graphics, a larger world, but still pretty much the same game engine and presentation. Embark on a glorious journey then save the world of CRON and yourself.

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.

    <desc>Long ago and far away, a legendary interdimensional being know as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove, to establish a vanguard in the never ending battle against evil. With the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them power to transform into a superhuman fighting force. In time of great need, the young heroes could call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords". While the identity of the six remain a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of legend, earning them the title... 

The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 

This game plays much like the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers game for the Super Nintendo. In other words, it is very nice. The graphics are great, good quality for the Genesis. The sounds and music are nice. Music from the TV Show is used when playing through different stages. The game-play is superb as well, fighting various enemies and giving you a good time to keep you going for a while. Give this a try if you're a fan of Power Rangers or platform games.

Directions:

In this game, you play through six stages of karate-kickin', mighty morphin' action! In the beginning, you can pick the ranger of your choice... 

There are six ones you can play as. Tommy the White Ranger, Rocky the Red Ranger, Adam the Black Ranger, Billy the Blue Ranger, Kimberly the Pink Ranger, and Aisha, the Yellow Ranger. 

In each stage, you must be able to make it through in the time given. You are usually encountered by a group of baddies, and you are given a starting time of 60 seconds. When you're able to beat them, the clock gives you more time. 

Power-ups might also be needed. In this case, Power Coins will be dropped when you defeat enemies. Each one gives a unique reward. 

There's also special attacks not listed in the Controls section. To run, tap the desired direction, left or right, twice. To attack when running, press B. When you hold B for a while, you can release it to unleash a more stronger attack. Press B repeatedly to do a combo attack.

Controls:

A Button: Special Move (WILL TAKE AWAY LIFE!)
B Button: Attack
C Button: Jump

Hints:

- Power Coin Uses. -
Mastodon Coin: Adds 1000 points to total 
Pterodactyl Coin: Restores one bar of Health 
Sabertooth Tiger Coin: Adds 3000 points 
Triceratops Coin: Restores half health bar

    <desc>An evil empress by the name of Rita Repulsa has made her dark presence felt when she had escaped from a space dumpster. She has devious plans to conquer the planet Earth, alongside her legion of minions. It's up to the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, Jason, Zack, Billy, Kimberly, and Trini, to go into battle with Rita and vanquish her forces with their weapons and power. Will they be able to send the queen packing? Or will Earth's fate be spelled out in doom? 

For those who absolutely love fighting games done in a style similar of Mortal Kombat And Street Fighter, I think most will find some enjoyment in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers for the Sega Genesis. The graphics are done very nicely, each fighting stage detailed as well as the adversaries you face. The sound is pretty neat, too, who doesn't love the nostalgic theme song most of us know and love? If you're a fan of fighting games, the original MMPR, or both, you'll be sure to have hours of fun with this one. Recommended, highly recommended.

Controls:

A Button: Weak Attack
B Button: Strong Attack
C Button: Nothing
X Button: Nothing
Y Button: Nothing
Z Button: Nothing
Start Button: Pause
Mode Button: Nothing

Hints:

- Evil Green Ranger in 2P Battle Mode -
When the Banpresto screen appears, press A, B, and C on the second player control repeatedly. You should hear the sound "Power Rangers". The Evil Green Ranger should now be available for use.

You'll find all kinds of unique and powerful options at your fingertips with this game: four different passing modes, the ability to make substitutions, 28 teams to choose from, and legendary referee Jim Tunney. As if that weren't enough, you'll also have more than 80 plays to choose from, and a unique behind-the-kicker perspective that makes field goal kicking a more integral part of the game. Strap on the pads and get ready for some hard-nosed football the way it should be played with MIKE DITKA POWER FOOTBALL.

    <desc>The strategy of baseball is merged with a fast-paced arcade game in MLBPA Baseball from Electronic Arts. Details designed to appeal to the die-hard fan include: real players with statistics based on the 1993 season; a full 162 game season mode; stadium music; animated scoreboards; defensive alignments; cut-off plays; run-downs; and even the double switch. Features meant to appeal to the casual fan include: large colorful arcade graphics; one stadium with animated crowds; a simplified pitching interface allowing players to steer the ball; and a batting interface that relies on timing instead of aiming cursors. Secret power-up play modes await so step up to the plate and take some hacks! Season play can be continued using passwords provided at the end of each game.

    <desc>Parker Brothers' MONOPOLY Real Estate Trading Game was presented to Parker Brothers during the Depression by Charles B. Darrow of Germantown, Pennsylvania. Darrow had made the first games by hand, given them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. But as demand grew, he could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to acquire the rights to the game in 1935.

Since then, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States but throughout the Western world. It is published under license in 32 countries and in 23 foreign languages!

This Sega Genesis version of the MONOPOLY game conforms to all the rules of the board game and some of the rules used in tournament play. The beauty of this version is that the system acts as the Banker and takes care of all the accounting and money management tasks - which speeds up play and prevents mathematical errors in the High Finance Department!

Note, too, that we've created a special series of 12 Wheel and Deal Preset Games. These four-player game setups assume you have already acquired certain properties and assign all players a certain amount of cash, which varies from scenario to scenario, so you can "cut to the chase" and begin the game at the high-stakes trading level. You may also create your own preset game by selecting "Options"; this way, you decide who gets what.

--From the Genesis Monopoly instruction manual.

Overview:

It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times. The Depression was still rolling on and what game did people love? That's right, one about tossing poor people into the streets. Nothing like "Fuzzy Bear brings Christmas Cheer to the Forest". Nope, nothing about lovable and generous neighbors harvesting your wheat for you. No, this game was about grabbing all of the gusto and chunking little Miss Maybell, the beloved elderly school teacher, out in the cold on her wrinkly butt. So if you are looking for a game with love and compassion, don't play Monopoly, play Resident Evil.

Excellent graphics, sounds and game action. Not much more to say, the computer game plays like the board game. One major problem is that if you make a mistake playing against the computer, you cannot undo it. The computer will blissfully move along ignoring all of your protests.

The great difference between playing the board game and the computer version is that even Charles Manson can play. "Friends? We don't need no stinking friends". So like Solitaire and Pro Basketball, you can play the game alone. Not that you have to. I mean, you can always invite Britney Spears and Lyndsay Lohan over for a spirited game. I do it all the time. Of course I end up playing alone against the computer. As you are likely to, also.

Directions:

Most of the choices that you make will have prompting on the screen telling you the appropriate buttons to select.

If you press the C Button to bring up the Main Menu, you will be asked which player you are. Choose the appropriate player with the D-Control and press the "A" Button. The Main Menu displays Buildings, Mortgages, Trades, Deeds and General. Select which one you want.

When you land on a piece of property, you can buy it or put it up for auction. If you put it up for auction, the Auction Screen opens and you have a chance to bid against the other players in the game.

To see what everybody has: property, cash, "Get Out of Jail Free" card, press the B button on your turn.

To get out of jail, you can chance rolling doubles on your turn or press the C Button to bring up the Main Menu. From the Main Menu, select the "Get Out of Jail" option to either use a "Get Out of Jail Free" card, if you have one, or to pay $50.00 if you don't.

Trading:

The process of trading can appear to be complex but actually isn't. First choose the Main Menu with the C Button, and then naturally select "Trade" with the D-Control and the A Button. Using the D-Control, point the Rich Uncle's hand towards your player and then select Property or Cash. Then using the D-Control and the "A" Button, choose the properties that you want to trade and/or the amount of cash that you are offering (D-Control UP or DOWN allows to change the cash value). If you are playing against the computer, you must do the same for him. Then move the Rich Uncle's hand to your Accept and push the A Button. If trading with a human player, they would do the same. If playing against the computer, he will evaluate the deal and accept it or refuse it. The computer is not stupid, so don't expect to get any easy deals.

Buying Houses or Hotels:

Press the C Button to bring up the Main Menu and choose Buildings. Choose buy houses or hotels. The screen should then allow you to scroll to the property that you want to place the buildings on. Then you should be given a screen allowing you to choose the number of houses to buy.

Selling Houses or Hotels:
Similar to Buying House or Hotels except it is a buyer's market; you sell at a great loss.

Controls:

A Button: Select/Buy/Bid/Menu
B Button: Auction/Assets
C Button: Main Menu
Start Button: Start Game

Hints:

20/20 Hindsight Advice
Don't invest in ENRON

Trivia:

The Sega Master System version (others might, too) of this game uses the classical music piece "The Entertainer", composed by Scott Joplin, for the theme song.

This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".

Translation Description

What do you all think of when you think of Sega games? That's right, you think of Wonderboy, because the Wonderboy games kick ass. All of them. Even Wonderboy in Monsterland. And Monster World 4 is no different.

Some people have told me that Wonderboy and Monster World are two completely different series, but they sure as hell play the same to me, so nyah. Anyway you play a cute girl with green hair, and you walk around and kill stuff. It RULES. And it's really really pretty, especially for such a crap system as the Genesis. Or the Mega Drive, whatever. It just rules, dammit. Go play. Enjoy. Hit Up to talk to people. Use the crystal DIRECTLY in front of the statue. And thank Demi for this kickass translation, which is now free of bugs. No more goddamn flickering. Kickass? Yaya.

    <desc>This rom hack is mostly for fixing those DULLARD cheat menu options to have more clear descriptions, like the Sega CD version has. But I also enabled the blood and changed "Rayden" to have his correct name "Raiden".

This patch makes a couple of minor changes to the Rev 00 game.

Mostly it changes the cheat menu's to have menu names like the Sega CD version to be more clear in their use.

I also enabled blood from the start and changed "Rayden" to be "Raiden" as he is called in the arcade counterparts.

    <desc>An evil wizard by the name of Shang Tsung held a tournament for the 7 best fighters he selected. Only the best fighter can succeed! But is Shang Tsung someone to be trusted? Play and find out for yourself! Oh, and did I mention all the blood?

Gameplay:

The game was a response by Midway to Capcom's successful Street Fighter II, which spawned a number of fighting games. However, it used a distinctly different fighting system from the Street Fighter formula, which was used in all subsequent sequels until Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. The controls consisted of five buttons arranged in an "X" pattern: a high punch, a high kick, a low punch, a low kick, and a block button, as well as an eight-way joystick.

If the two fighters were standing next to each other, hitting any of the attack buttons would result in a modified strike: a low punch turned into a throw, a high punch turned into a heavy elbow, head butt, or backhand, and either kick turned into a knee strike. Crouching and hitting high punch resulted in an uppercut, which was the most damaging attack of the game. Jump kicking and crouch-kicking were executed in a similar fashion to Street Fighter, although leg sweeps and roundhouse kicks were performed by holding away while pressing the appropriate kick button.

The blocking in Mortal Kombat by itself greatly changed the flow of fighting in comparison to contemporary games which used Street Fighter conventions. Characters do not block while retreating or crouching, but only block when the block button is pushed. Even then, characters take (reduced) damage from any hit while blocking. However, successfully blocking moves is simple - a crouching block can successfully defend against all moves, even aerial attacks such as jump kicks - and blocking characters give very little ground when struck rather than sliding backwards. This style of blocking rewarded dodging to avoid damage but also made counterattacks much easier after a successful block, and the ultimate result was an environment which rewards a more furtive playing style than contemporary games.

Each of the seven playable characters move and fight in the exact same fashion, which led to complaints that the characters lacked distinction. However, each character's moves differed in their hit detection, speed, and damage. For example, Kano's crouching kick dealt more damage than other characters' crouching kicks, while Raiden's jump kick had a longer range than other jump kicks.

The game retained a similar scoring system (based on successful hits, the Test Your Might minigame and other bonuses) to those games; this would be dropped in later entries to the Mortal Kombat series in favor of counting wins.

Another of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a beaten opponent to kill them in a gruesome fashion. For example, Sub-Zero would grasp a defeated opponent by the head, then rip out the head and spine while the body crumpled to the ground in a pool of blood.

Mortal Kombat also introduced the concept of juggling, an idea so popular it has spread to many games and even other genres. Juggling takes advantage of the fact that when a character is knocked into the air, that player is unable to control his or her character and is still vulnerable to other hits, until he or she lands and gets up again. The idea behind juggling is to knock the enemy into the air and then follow up with other combat moves to keep them there. Theoretically, one could juggle one's opponent to death without ever taking damage, though this was difficult to accomplish in practice. In early versions of the game, juggling was extremely easy because the physics caused characters to fly upwards when hit; by version 5.0, however, characters reacted with somewhat more realism, and also fell more rapidly with successive hits, effectively limiting juggles to 3 hits under normal circumstances.

Mortal Kombat also changed the way special moves were performed. Street Fighter (and many other fighting games) performed most special moves in fractions of circles (usually full, half or one-quarter) on the joystick followed by a button press (such as a quarter-circle forward + punch). Mortal Kombat was the first to introduce moves that did not require a button press (such as tap back, tap back, then forward), and only a few of the special moves required circular joystick movement. Finally, Mortal Kombat was the first versus-fighting game to feature a secret character: Reptile.

Directions:

You can fight through a ladder of opponents such as any fighting game today. There is also a VS. mode where players 1 and 2 can go at it! Choose from these seven characters: Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kano, Sonya Blade, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Raiden! When the person's health is really low, try to use a fatality!

Controls:

A Button: Low Punch
B Button: Block
C Button: Low Kick
X Button: High Punch
Y Button: Block
Z Button: High Kick
Start Button: Start game

Hints:

    <desc>This one is definitely the oddest of them all. Mortal Combat 5 (as it reads on the title screen) is an attempt to re-create the Playstation game Mortal Kombat Mythologies on the Genesis. All sprites in this game have been ripped out of previous Genesis Mortal Kombat games (I assume Ultimate MK 3 was used). You control Sub-Zero and battle through sprite-swapped variations of Kano, Sonya or Liu Kang, running through levels which are visually designed to resemble their Playstation counterparts. The backgrounds constantly repeat themselves, which makes the maze-like design of the stages irritatingly hard! Also, there are a lot of cheap instant-kill deathtraps in this game that increase the insane base difficulty even more (the difficulty settings in the option screen seem like a bad joke). However, this game is strangely compelling, so you keep playing nevertheless even though you know it'll only frustrate you.

In theory, the whole thing is rather short and incomplete (it apparently ends abruptly after stage four), but it certainly doesn't feel that way!

    <desc>The Pacman series is a monster in the classic video game world. It started a new genre when it came out in Japan in 1979. Most games coming out at the time were either space shooters or pong-like sports games. This new genre appealed to both males and females. This made it so popular, it inspired more than thirty officially licensed sequels, numerous bootlegs, home-brews, and clones, a plethora of merchandise, a top forty pop song, and even an animated series. This addition to the series came from an unofficial bootleg called Crazy Otto. Fearing a lawsuit from the Namco, Midway signed the rights to them and Ms. Pacman was born.

It plays just like Pacman, except it has different mazes and the bonus items move around the board. It was a lot of fun to play! The graphics were great, and so were the sounds and controls. The different difficulty levels made this game pretty interesting, too. If you put the difficulty on crazy, it was just that. Everything would be moving so fast, I don't think there is a human that could keep up. Another cool thing about Ms. Pac-Man was the addition of the story scenes. As you play through the game, you will see scenes of Mr. and Ms. Pac-Man meeting, falling in love, and getting visits from the stork. When you beat the game, you get to see all the kids running around. This game is a lot of fun, and if you are a Pacman fan, you will go nuts over this game!

Directions:

Eat all the dots in the maze. There will sometimes be fruit that you can eat for bonus points. Avoid the ghosts. If one touches you, you die. When you eat the big dot, you are able to eat the ghosts during a short period of time.

Once that time is up, it's back to them getting you! They added a Pac-Booster to this game, which was cool. It made you go faster. In the options you could set it to be on when you hit one of the buttons, or you could set it to be always on or off.
The object is to get as many points as you can, but you actually can beat the game. After you beat the last level, a cute little animation will be your reward.

Controls:

D-pad: Choose direction
A, B, or C Button: Pac-booster (when activated)
Start Button: Pause

Hints:

- Easy Levels -
If you put the maze selection on mini, the levels will be smaller and therefore have less dots to eat.

    <desc>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing is a boxing video game that was developed by Park Place Productions and published by Virgin Interactive in 1992. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive / Sega Genesis console.

The game features Muhammad Ali, and 9 fictional heavyweight boxers. The game uses a mixture of 2D sprites and 3D ring to allow boxers to move 360 degrees about the ring.

In career mode, the player can choose to fight as any of the game's 10 boxers. They start at rank 10 in the heavyweight division, and fight their way through all the others in order.

Gameplay:

During fights, available punches to be throw include jabs, hooks, crosses and uppercuts. In simulation mode it is possible to choose to throw any type of punch with either hand, whereas in arcade mode, the player chooses which type of punch to throw and the Megadrive determines which of the boxer's fists is the most appropriate to throw it. Defensive manoeuvers include blocking and clinching. The more punches a boxer throws, the less damage their punches do.

The game can be played in either arcade or simulation mode. Many in-game features are customizeable, including ring length, number of rounds, and the length of time a boxer must be floored to be classed as knocked out.

The visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers, and a simple 3D rendering of the ring. The boxers' sprites include views of them from a side-on position, and from viewpoints that show them having turned a small distance clockwise or anti-clockwise around the ring. As a boxer attempt to moves around the ring, the appropriate series of sprites are shown, which works to give the illusion of them turning about (or attempting to).

Blood effects simulate the cuts that boxers sometimes suffer during matches. However, the effect is wildly exaggerated in the game, so that huge splashes of blood can sometimes be seen flying off a boxer's face. Blood stains remain on the ring floor for the rest of a match; combined with the amount of blood that comes out of fighters' faces, this often leads to much of the ring being covered in it by the end of a match. The damage received to a boxer's face is shown by close-up pictures that are shown between rounds. Such images show wounds such as bloody noses or black eyes. Such wounds start off semi-realistic, but after sustained punishment, often develop into wildly exaggerated versions of the kind of injuries boxers suffer- in the later rounds of a fight, boxers' faces will sometimes be ripped open by so many large, gaping cuts that they are practically unrecognisable as human beings, let alone individual boxers.

Rather than providing an accurate representation of reality, the game's sound effects reflect an attempt to make the game more exciting by exaggerating the impact force of punches. The effects for hard punches, in particular, sound extremely forceful, being more reminiscent of a car door being slammed shut than boxing-glove covered fists impacting with another person.

The game featured digitised speech effects for the introduction of fighters, knockdown counts, and the announcement of the outcome of a fight. It is also one of the few boxing games to depict an in-game referee.

While after each fight, judges' scorecards are shown for each round, these almost always have no bearing on who the winner is. This is because the winner is decided solely by whichever boxer lands more punches in a fight. The only occasion these scorecards decide an outcome is if both fighters land the exact same number of punches during a fight.

Trivia:

The in-game boxer, Bruno Franko, is a play on the name of real-life heavyweight boxer, Frank Bruno.

This is a Beta version of the game, development was stopped due to the introduction of newer 32bit consoles and the demise of the Genesis/Mega-Drive. Unfortunately it shows, poor graphics (especially for a Disney game) and sound with poor level design make this more of a curiosity than anything else.

    <desc>A spin-off from the successful Aleste series by Compile, Musha Aleste takes the same top-down shooter mechanics of it's predecessors but stages the action in a bizarre universe that merges traditional Japanese lore with sci-fi mecha action.

Instead of commanding a ship, you will actually step into the cockpit of a ninja-styled mecha as you fight through the many levels in the game, with several option satellites that can be configured to use different formations.

Hints:

- Five Bonus Lives: -
To earn five bonus lives, pause the game and push Right, Down, Right, Down, Left, Up, Left, Up, B, C, A and than Start.

    <desc>Mystical Fighter is a beat 'em up game. This game is known in Japan as Mao Renjishi. Mao literally means demon king in Japanese.

The story, designs, and characters are base on Japanese mythology. Like in most scrolling fighters, the player (who controls a kabuki) can use combos, flips and swings fight against tough opponents. There is also a timed limit, usually about forty seconds, for the player to finish the stage. If the time reaches zero before the player passes the stage it results in a defeat. Similar to Golden Axes the player can use a special magic power, but instead of bottles the player must manually pick up scrolls. The more scrolls the player has the stronger the magic attack will be, however if the player chooses to use this attack all the scrolls will consumed.

Gameplay:

Despite the time limit the player will spend most of the time mashing mainly the A and B button while fighting three to five opponents at in time. There are also hidden bonus stages that can be accessed if the player approaches certain doors or rooms. These bonus stages depend on which level they are located in and contain either magic scrolls or items to increase the character's health bar. The boss fights are often easier than regular enemies. There are also traps and holes that both the player or the enemies could fall in if they are not careful. The traps and pits do not always hinder the player, and in fact can be beneficial if the player throws an enemy directly into the pit.

    <desc>Mystic Defender (based on the Japanese title Kujaku? 2: Geneij?) is a side-scrolling platform game. It is the sequel to SpellCaster for the Sega Master System. However, in this sequel the RPG elements have been omitted in favour of side-scrolling platform gameplay.

In this game you play Joe Yamata (Kujaku) on a quest to rescue Alexandra from the villainous Zao, who is using her soul to resurrect his master Zareth in Azuchi castle. You have four types of magic to attack with and you can charge your blasts as well as change the magic type mid-game.

The game also includes three Hall of Fame teams filled with 30 all-time greats such as Bill Walton, "Pistol Pete" Maravich, and Dr. J.

Other features include: adjustable quarters (4, 8 and 12 minutes), fouls, instant replay, a Shot Chart, fatigue, an optional ball indicator to help determine the release point, and a Role Play option which allows you to play the entire game as one player! Having some trouble with your offense? Players can call three plays to help them gain an advantage: pick/screen, clear out and the double screen. Battery backup will save team statistics and league standings in your quest to bring home the championship, and up to five players can play at once with a Team Player adaptor.

NBA HangTime is a two-on-two hoops contest in the tradition of NBA Jam and NBA Jam T.E. Choose from 29 NBA teams and 145 professional stars with ratings based on the 1995-96 season, or create your own players and save them to battery. Customize your athlete's head, uniform, attributes, or name, and then build his ratings by winning games or correctly answering trivia questions. Sixteen different heads allow you to create offbeat characters such as aliens or clowns.

Moves include alley oops, spin moves, double dunks, and team "fire" (players get hot after making three shots in a row). Up to four players can compete simultaneously in venues ranging from a rooftop and jungle arena to a harbor and city court. Enter in codes to unlock hidden characters, power-ups, and other bonuses. The game will also keep track of statistics such as points-per-game average, longest winning streak, most games played, and overall winning percentage.

    <desc>This sequel to the popular NBA Jam doubles the number of NBA players and secret characters, so you can now make substitutions after every quarter. Nine new earth shattering dunks have been added to the lineup and a battery will save your records, ranking and winning percentage against the 27 featured NBA teams. Perhaps the biggest additions are the Hot Spots option, which places random circles on the court with different point values, and Power-Up Icons, which will temporarily affect a player's abilities. Otherwise, it's the same two-on-two dunk fest as the original.

For those unfamiliar with NBA Jam, the action is played from a horizontal view of the court as you control one player on offense. The object is to score as many points as you can while trying to prevent the other team from doing the same. Controls on offense consist of a passing, shooting and turbo button, while defense replaces the shooting button with a jump. By pressing the turbo button, players can not only move faster, but perform special moves such as acrobatic dunks or gravity defying jumps. Grab up to three friends and everyone can play at the same time with an adapter!

Controls:

A: Shoot
B: Turbo
C: Pass
D-Pad: Move player

    <desc>NBA Jam is a two-on-two basketball game You can play any NBA team, and you can play as players like Barkley, Starks, Pippen, and Grant. Each human player controls a single player, so choose your squad wisely to take team-mate skill into account. The game is action-oriented, and players can perform unrealistic slam-dunks. Full performance statistics are automatically recorded. The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.

Hints:

Always on Fire Mode
At the Tonight's Match-up Screen enter the following code... 

Hit any button 7 times then hold Up and press B + C 

If you entered the code correctly you should be on fire the whole game.

    <desc>Electronic Arts abandons the engine found in their previous four Genesis basketball games with the release of NBA Live 95. The title features a new 30 degree perspective to expand your view of the court and a TV-style presentation that updates player stats, streaks and shooting percentages along the bottom of the screen.

Passing on the run, blocks, alley-oops and dunks are also included to give you complete control of the action. Use the turbo button to streak by defenders trying to stop your drive to the net! Those who prefer a more strategic game will appreciate the 46 offensive plays and four defensive sets. 

Three difficulty levels, four different quarter settings, and thirteen rules (including fatigue and injuries) can be adjusted to suit your style of play. Game modes include playing a full or reduced Season, Exhibition game or Playoffs. This 16-Meg cartridge offers battery backup to save user, team and individual player statistics along with season records and playoff position. 

All 27 NBA teams from the 1994-95 season are included (ratings are based on the 1993-94 season), as well as two All-Star and four custom teams. Key differences from the Super Nintendo version include: complete statistical tracking during season, 4 Way Play support, automatic steals and updated rosters.

All of the players, but the one you are currently controlling, will freeze. This allows you to practice with a shot percentage.

    <desc>NBA Live 96 contains all of the aspects of NBA basketball. Real teams and players are featured along with a create player option. The create player option allows this game to include all of the NBA superstars who may not be included in the NBA players license. Simply type in a players name who is not in the game and he will be created. This also works with many past NBA players, many of which are now in the Hall of Fame.

Aside from all of the players included, NBA Live 96 has a lot of gameplay options. More than 60 offensive plays and 10 defensive sets. Season, exibition, and playoff modes, including an NBA draft option. You can also play with the 2 all-star teams or create 4 custom teams. There is also 4-Way Play compatibility for 4 player action.

NBA Live 96 provides basketball action with plenty of options and realistic gameplay.

    <desc>Basketball returns to the Genesis with NBA Live 97, the third game in Electronic Arts' NBA Live series. In addition to the crossover dribbles, alley-oops, tip slams and behind-the-back passes, there are now reverse layups and dunks. Stealing the ball from an opponent can finally be performed manually, and a new player lock feature allows you the chance to play as one professional throughout the game. Choose from 29 NBA, two All-Star and four custom teams as you embark on a Season, Exhibition game or round of Playoffs. 

While the rosters have been updated to reflect the 1996-97 season (including rookies and Shaquille O'Neal), you can either trade, release or create players and save them to battery. New two-on-two and three-on-three halfcourt games have been added along with three-point and shoot-out competitions. Of course, an EA Sports game would not be complete without stat tracking, and NBA Live 97 lets you record player statistics, team leaders, league leaders and playoff stats. Coaches take note: over 60 offensive plays and 10 defensive sets are here, as is on-the-fly playcalling. Call the intentional foul to stop Shaq from driving down the lane!

    <desc>The fourth and final game in Electronic Arts' NBA Live series on Genesis features new team and player practice modes, trades based on player ratings, and a computer-generated All-Star game decided by the top performers from around the league. The game's 29 teams and 300 players have also been updated to reflect their actual abilities during the 1996-97 season, and the NBA season schedule mirrors the one used during 1997-98.

Returning to the game are both three-on-three and two-on-two half-court modes as well as the option to create, edit, or trade players. Four custom teams are also available, and players can compete in individual three-point and shoot-out contests apart from the main action. The game is still played from a three-quarter perspective with TV-style updates that display the score as well as individual statistics during each quarter. Notable moves include reverse layups, alley-oops, spins, crossover dribbles, and baseball passes.

Up to four players can participate in an exhibition, season, playoff or practice game on one of three difficulty levels: rookie, starter or all-star. Options include adjustable quarters (from three to twelve minutes), a choice of an arcade or a simulation play style (which determines if players tire, get injured, or foul out), and custom rules such as backcourt violations or goal tending. Battery backup saves season progress, user records, roster moves, and custom teams.

    <desc>NCAA Football features forty Division I-A teams in your choice of two game modes: Exhibition or Tournament. Exhibition lets you pick any two teams for a single game against either the computer or a friend, while Tournament involves taking your favorite team through sixteen games in an effort to win the Championship.

NCAA Football adopts a horizontal perspective and control scheme not unlike Tecmo Super Bowl -- scroll through your receivers by tapping a button and then fire the pass using a second button. The ball carrier can then run, dive, lateral or spin. On defense, players can switch to the closest defender at any time in order to make the tackle.

Other notable features include: over sixty plays on offense and defense; college teams spanning four decades (from the '60s to the '90s); adjustable quarter lengths; multiple weather conditions; instant replay; and battery backup to save tournament progress after the console is turned off. NCAA Football is also available for the Super Nintendo.

    <desc>The first college basketball game for the Sega Genesis, NCAA Final Four Basketball features 64 NCAA Division I teams, five player support with the use of a multiplayer adapter, and three different play modes: Practice, Tournament and Exhibition. Exhibition is one game against any two teams of your choice, Practice Mode allows you to hone your skills without worrying about a pesky defense (it's just two players and the ball), and Tournament lets you pick one team with the goal of moving past the Regionals and into the Final Four. There's also a mode that involves practicing your three-point shooting skills, with a perspective just behind the player's head looking toward the basket.

NCAA Final Four Basketball offers an in-depth control system, allowing for three different passes (chest, overhead and bounce), fake shots and jumps, intentional fouls, bank shots, and dunks or layups. Players can also choose one of six different defensive formations to keep the offense guessing, including man, zone and pressure defenses from either half or full court. Rounding out the package are fouls (easy going, none or strict), player fatigue, instant replay and adjustable game length (10, 20, 30 or 40 minutes). Battery backup allows tournament progress to be resumed after the console is turned off.

    <desc>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. 

The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race. A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.

Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.

    <desc>A must play hack of Sonic the Hedgehog. Marble, Starlight and Green hill zone bosses have been changed to be completely hard and at some points just insane.

More than just the bosses though, theres the spindash, theres also new pallets. Green Hill Zone is completely done. The beginning of clock work is done, the "doom path" in Labyrinth is changed. There is even a nice transition from Labyrinth to marble. Level order is changed too:

- Green Hill
- Labyrinth
- Marble
- Star Light
- Sparkling (spring yard)
- Clock work(Scrap Brain)

If you like sonic hacks I strongly encourage you to try this one.

    <desc>Take to land, sea, and air as you help Tiki rescue twenty of his friends from Wally the hungry walrus. Armed with a bow and arrow, players control Tiki as he travels all over New Zealand in search of his caged pals. Power-ups such as bombs and laser guns will aid Tiki's quest, and players can commandeer flying vehicles to take down enemies and gain access to higher platforms. Spelling "EXTEND" will earn an extra life, and if players lose their final life in later stages they will have a chance to extend their playing time by competing in "Heaven" rounds.

    <desc>NFL '95 improves the passing game of previous Sega football titles by allowing the player to see up to 65 yards down the field. The view is not fixed, however; it will dynamically change during play. Whenever a running back or receiver grabs the ball, the camera will zoom in for a close-up of the action. You can also elect to play as the receiver from the line of scrimmage, so you can run your own route and then signal for the ball. 

Both the NFL and NFLPA licenses are included, so all 28 pro teams are here as well as over 1,500 players rated in thirteen categories based on the 1993 season. Full season play is also available with multiple schedules, instant replays, injuries, trades, free agents and playoffs in your bid to become Super Bowl champion. Battery backup means you can track league leaders and save team standings through an entire season, along with the records of up to seven users.

    <desc>NFL 98, Sega's final football game for the Genesis platform, uses the same engine as found in Prime Time Football starring Deion Sanders. Updates include player statistics and ratings based on the 1996 season, the ability to play a full 1997 schedule, Practice Mode, adjustable artificial intelligence settings, and the option to view both instructions and rules of play within the game.

The most notable new feature is customizing how either the computer or your team plays in the following areas (from zero to six, with six being the highest): player speed, speed burst effect, dive effect, defensive tackling, offensive fumbles, blocking, pass accuracy, aggressiveness, cause interceptions, pass deflections, pass interference, CPU kick accuracy, kick meter speed and injuries. Besides the different settings found within the Rookie, Veteran, All-Pro and Hall of Fame difficulty levels, you can save up to four custom settings per team. 

All other features are carried over from 1995's game, except for the option to play multiple season schedules. Players can still adjust game time (5,10 or 15 minute quarters), weather, field conditions, and even choose their own playbook from any team in the game. Speaking of which, 30 NFL teams are included from the 1996 season, as well as both AFC and NFC Stars, NFL All-Pros and six regional teams featuring stars organized by where they went to college. 

Complete roster management lets you organize your team as you see fit, including trades, substitutions, signing or releasing fee agents, and creating new players. Battery backup will store your season in progress, allow you to create and save up to 15 user records, track each team in 42 different categories and individual players in 32 areas. As in the previous two Sega football games, NFL 98 uses a vertical view of the field that will zoom in for a closeup once the ball crosses the line of scrimmage.

    <desc>The 24-Meg NFL Quarterback Club offers three different ways to play: QB Challenge, Simulation Mode and NFL Play. The QB Challenge has you choosing a quarterback (or creating up to five of your own) as you prepare to compete in four events: distance; accuracy; speed and mobility; and read and recognition. Simulation Mode has you playing through one of thirty different scenarios, while NFL Play lets players embark on a full 16-game Season, Preseason, Playoffs, or Pro Bowl with progress saved to battery. 

While the game does not feature an NFLPA license for real players, it does offer nineteen actual quarterbacks from the 1993 season, including Steve Young, Dan Marino, John Elway and Troy Aikman. Other notable features include: over 430 plays to choose from; instant replay; variable weather (fair, rain or snow); custom audibles; three difficulty levels (rookie, pro or all-pro); adjustable quarter lengths (from one to fifteen minutes); and player animation showing taunts, spikes, high-steps, and various other moves.

    <desc>Lace up your skates, grab your stick, and hit the ice with NHL Hockey for the Sega Genesis. The game features 22 NHL teams with players modeled on actual NHL athletes. Once in the rink, you'll need to quickly learn the skills of skating, passing and shooting, or you'll be shutout by the competition. You can play rough, but watch out for the ref. He'll be watching out for any illegal contact like slashing and tripping.

Choose to play a regular season game, or fight your way through the playoffs to the Stanley Cup Finals. A variety of options allow you to tailor the game to your skill level, including the ability select the length of the game and to turn penalties on or off. You can also play against a friend, or decide to team up together against a computer opponent.

This time around full NHLPA rosters are included as well as the ability to create and save team lines via the battery backup. Realistic elements have also been added such as player fights and a pane of glass behind the goal that can now be shattered. Injuries can knock players out of a period or a game, and will cause the injured player to release a small pool of blood onto the ice. Classic features include instant replay and two-player cooperative mode.

    <desc>The third game in EA SPORTS' acclaimed hockey series for the Genesis, NHL '94 brings together both the NHL and the NHLPA licenses for the first time. Twenty-five new features have been added to the game, including four-player support with the 4 Way Play adapter, manual goalie control, penalty shots, one timers, seventy pieces of organ music (sampled from actual arenas around the league), Shootout Mode, and battery back-up to save individual records (seven in total). 

Player ratings and rosters are based on the 1992-93 season and both expansion teams, Anaheim and Florida, are here as well. Improvements in the graphics include new checking animations, fans pounding the glass and team logos at center ice. Two things are missing from the previous version, however: fighting and blood. Other than these omissions, the game remains faithful to its lineage. Take to the ice and bring home the Stanley Cup!

B Button: Pass puck.
C Button: Speed burst (body check).
D-Pad: Control direction of pass.

OFFENSE

    <desc>NHL '95 is one game in a prolific series of fast-paced hockey simulations from EA Sports. You choose from amongst the 1994 rosters and take the ice with players such as Sergei Federov and Joe Sakic.

In NHL '95, for the Sega Genesis, up to four players face off from an overhead perspective. NHL '95 contains all the trappings of a real game and the graphics are fluid and smooth. You have the option to adjust realistic features such as penalties, off-sides and line changes. In addition, NHL '95 offers a full season mode with in depth statistics, trades, and player creation. You can even practice your breakaway moves on the "shootout" mode.

Controls:

OFFENCE

A: Flip puck down ice.
Hold A: Bring up line menu.
B: Pass, you control the direction with d-pad.
C: Shoot, you control the direction with the d-pad and the power with the duration of your depression.
Start: Pause.

DEFENCE

A: "Stick work"
Hold A: Bring up line change menu.
B: Switch to nearest player to the puck.
C: Speed burst or "check."

    <desc>Electronic Arts' longstanding hockey franchise comes to a 16-bit end with NHL 98, the seventh game released in the Genesis series. While the same engine found in both NHL 96 and NHL 97 is used in this game, there are a few new features that set this title apart from the rest. These include the following: three different game speeds to choose from; a two-line pass rule; a "Coaching Style" menu allowing players to apply one of five strategies (offense, defense, balanced, all-out offense or all-out defense) to different lines; updated team rosters to reflect the 1997 season; player ratings based on the 1996 season; automatic goalie switching; and enhanced penalty awareness. 

Returning to the game are 26 NHL teams, two All-Star squads, and three National teams (United States, Canada and Europe). Battery backup will track statistics, season progress and All-Time Records in thirteen categories, including "Most Breakaways," "Fastest Goal" and "Best Shooting Percentage." The seven game modes consist of Regular Game, Playoffs, Best-of-Seven Playoffs, Season, Shootout, Practice, and Skills Challenge. Complete roster management lets you trade, create, release or sign players, so you can put yourself in the game if you so desire! Up to four players can play simultaneously with the 4-Way Play adapter.

Controls:

OFFENSE

D-Pad: Move player, control direction of shot
A: Clear puck/flip pass
B: Pass puck
C: Wrist-shot (hold for slap shot) or one-timer without the puck
A + D-Pad Up or Down: Drop pass
Start: Pause game, go to menu screen

DEFENSE

A: Holds/hooks (tap A for a block shot)
B: Poke check/trip/switch to closest man (hold B to switch to goalie in manual control)
C + D-Pad: Speed burst
Pad: Controls skating direction

Hints:

- Hidden teams -
Hold A and B and C and Start at the same time at the game menu screen until the team selection menu appears. The EA Sports and THQ Inc. teams may now selectable. 

- Play with man advantage -
This code only works when you play against the computer, and they only have 2 active goalies. First, you must injure the opponents starting goalie. This works best by running into him many times. It would be helpful to turn penalties off, so you don't get called for interference. Once he is injured, score enough goals for the computer to switch goalies. When this happens, one of their defensemen will be the goalie, but he won't be replaced. The game still treats this as even strength, so icing still applies.

    <desc>Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a championship had finally come good. The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices - pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

    <desc>This version is an extremely loose translation of the original arcade game, and not a particularly good one. Like all side-scrolling beat-em-ups, it requires a lot of repetition and button-pounding in order to succeed.

This one was actually news to me until very recently. It was never released in the U.S., but oddly enough, almost all of the in-game text is (extremely bad) English.

The plot is completely different from the original NES game, and Ryu is a less likable character. He's been sent by his ninja master to America in order to hunt down a fellow ninja who has betrayed his clan and stolen the "Secret Scroll of Huma" (or Homa, depending on the given moment in the game).

Not much of a plot, and not really much of a game. Much like the original arcade game, it gets tedious and boring rather quickly. The arcade game, however, had cool moves like the Phoenix Backflip and the ability to hang from overhead bars and swing. Ninja Gaiden for the Genesis offers no such respite from the tedium. The graphics are passable for the less-than-spectacular capabilities of the Genesis. There were several other games which had much better graphics and gameplay.

This one probably stayed in Japan for a reason... worth a play or two if you can find it, but not worth any significant amount of money. If you're looking for a good beat-em-up on the Genesis, go get a Streets of Rage game.

    <desc>When Japanese leader Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa fell from power in 1467, it basically left Japan without a central government. This lead to a war amongst Japanese fiefs (states). Each fief was ruled by a powerful lord called a daimyo. Each daimyo believed he was the most qualified to be the new Shogun. The war lasted for more than 100 years. Nobunaga's Ambition is based on these events. As a daimyo in this Warring States Period of Japan, it is your job to unify all the fiefs into one sovereign nation. In the first scenario, you must unify central Japan, which is composed of 17 fiefs. In the other three scenarios, the Japanese nation is divided into 50 fiefs, all of which must be conquered.

After you have created a name for you daimyo and chosen your home base, it's time to get to work. Prior to setting out to conquer other territories, you should fortify your home base. This involves cultivating your land, protecting it against floods, and winning the approval of your people. To gain loyalty amongst your population, you should pay your people from the gold you collect from your rice crops. You should also use your gold to hire soldiers.

Other factors important to winning the war include the age, health, drive, luck, charm, and intelligence of your daimyo. Among the ways you can add or subtract to these attributes are by winning battles, conducting successful negotiations, and by earning the loyalty of your people. Fief conditions also apply. You must ensure that your fief has an ample supply of gold, rice, productivity, wealth, men, morale, skill, and arms.

When confronting the surrounding fiefs, you can send a ninja to spy on them, attack them outright, or sign a non-aggression pact. Other things you can do in this game include marrying another daimyo's daughter, bribing rival fief's peasants, borrowing money, deploying troops, and staving off peasant uprisings. The game is over when your daimyo dies from illness, old age, or battle wounds.

    <desc>Based on the 1994 film of the same name (which starred Ray Liotta), No Escape drops you smack dab in the middle of Absolom Island, a multi-complex penitentiary known for its life sentences and the short life expectancy of its inmates. It seems you murdered your commanding military officer while you were in a dream-induced fit of rage.

You have heard through the grapevine that there is a place on the island called the village. The village is where the civilized inmates live. You want to go there at all costs, because it is your only hope for escape.

You begin the game in the thick of the jungle with nothing more than the clothes on your back and your years of combat training. You must run fast and avoid as many hazards (falling bags of sand, bursts of hot steam, spears in the ground, tree limbs and the like) as you can along the way. While you are on the run, Tree Dwellers, Techno Warriors and other prison thugs will come after you with darts, blowguns, knives and other weapons. Fight them off and avoid their fists and weapons. 

Throughout the game there are more than 150 objects for you to find, including an engine distributor, a hacksaw, tin snips, a rusty compass, shafts of wood, bolts, butane gas, an empty butane lantern, bulbs and an iron crowbar. Many of the objects can be combined to create new weapons and tools, such as a crossbow, sticks of dynamite or woodwork tools. 

A mapping system lets you enter the next destination you would like to explore. The village is a temporary safe haven where you can gain information and trade for new objects. The other four locations are filled with traps and enemies. Each of the sectors has multiple sub-sections to explore. Only when you have successfully completed a sub-sector can you move onto the next sub-sector in that area.

Trivia:

Released in 1994, the action/prison film No Escape starred Ray Liotta and Lance Henriksen.

    <desc>As a highly respected warrior, you are attempting to conquer as many regions as possible. This is a three-stage task, as first you must fight through hordes of fighters simply to reach the castle, and then you have to climb the various sections of the castle, before battling with its existing inhabitant.

The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately throughout the game, and must both be kept high.

Hints:

- End Password -
Enter the following code at the Password Screen: 0000 - 0000 - 00
Then you should have all but the last territory conquered.

    <desc>The Ooze is a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game created by STI in 1995.

The Ooze is based on an algorithmically-generated cellular automaton. As such, the main character can be split apart and reformed like a viscous liquid. The gameplay is reminiscent of The Bitmap Brothers' game The Chaos Engine (called Soldiers of Fortune in the US). The art style evokes a cartoony (necessitated by the constraints of the medium) H.R. Giger. The story recalls The Toxic Avenger.

The development team included people who later worked for Blizzard North on Diablo and Diablo II, including designer Stieg Hedlund. Some of the programming was fairly advanced for a 16-bit system; for example, the speed powerup effect was actually created by decreasing the viscosity of the character.</desc>

    <desc>One day, Osomatsu's five brothers went missing. The mischievous Iyami, of course, must be behind this! With great haste, Osomatsu grabs his slingshot, and sets out to rescue his brothers and give Iyami a taste of his own medicine.

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijou (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd. The player controls the titular Osomatsu through outlandishly Japanese environments, fighting bizarre enemies, collecting ribbons to buy various items from hidden shops, and searching for his missing brothers. Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds. A boss waits at the end of each stage, usually just Iyami in some sort of strange disguise.

    <desc>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

Gameplay:

The Ottifants is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through six worlds: starting with the house, the basement and the garden through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. In addition to this, enemies can be destroyed by stomping on them. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies and blasting enemies is not the only way to gain points. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the six worlds. By successfully completing a secret room, the player receives a 1,000 point bonus. Finding all jelly babies in a stage is rewarded with 100 extra points.

    <desc>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.

The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.

Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.

    <desc>As you wheel your speedy Ferrari along winding roads, huge bolts of lightning arc brilliantly across the sky. You put your lead foot all the way to the floor, and your car moves effortlessly across the slick highway. Slowing down for the turn, you skid into the parking lot of the lab. You are Lester Knight Chaykin, cool scientist extraordinaire.

After passing the standard series of entry tests, you are given the high level of clearance necessary for entry into the lab. With a loud sigh, you collapse into the comfortable plush computer chair and flick on your trusty computer. Opening a can of soda, you take a huge gulp as the machine loads up. With the swiftness that only years of experience can bring, you type in commands and begin the nuclear experiment. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning surges into the lab and collides with your experiment, winking you out of existence.

Seconds later you find yourself sitting in your chair, submerged in a pool of water. You feverishly swim toward the surface as tentacles (!) reach up for you. After a narrow escape, you climb out of the water and look around. You are greeted by an entirely new environment, one of strange animals gone mad. A blood-curdling howl cuts through the silence, and you scramble to your feet. Where are you? You are out of this world.

The action in Out of This World for the Genesis will have you walking, kicking, swinging, ducking, running, jumping, shooting and battling your way through the strange new world in order to get back home. Elevators and transporters can be used to reach different locations of the game. You must solve a variety of puzzles and avoid a number of pitfalls and traps along the way.

Trivia:

The original Out of this World game was released to the PC in 1990. The Genesis version is a straightforward port.

Out of this World was one of the last commercially released games for the Apple IIgs. The port was written by Bill Heineman, who also was responsible for the SNES version (both the IIgs and the SNES share the same main processor). If the screen size was reduced, the game ran extremely smoothly on a stock unaccelerated IIgs.

Controls:

A Button: Kick, fire gun
B Button: Hold down to run
C Button: Jump

    <desc>Out Run 2019 is a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis-only pseudo-sequel to Out Run that takes place in the future. The object is to race against time in a rocket-powered car (with a maximum speed of 682 mph) across five different stages around the world. Like the original Out Run, there is a fork in the road before each checkpoint; however, there can also be forks within a single route.

Out Run 2019 featured four different stages to race across, each one harder than the last. Like in Out Run, at the end of every route, there will be a diverge between the next two routes. Also, throughout most of the stages, some routes will diverge, splitting into two different roadways. Usually, some of the roads will lead onto a bridge over ground, and in some cases, over water. Slipping off the bridges will cost the player precious time.

Sometimes, when the roads split, they will lead to a different kind of road. This is usually seen by means of a three-way diverge sign, which means the player can choose whether to go left, right, or continue forward. For example, on one route in Stage 4, some parts of the road are covered in wet cement. Another features the player driving into a tunnel. The last will lead the player over a bridge.

Finally, there are also secret diverges that can be spotted easily. For example, some areas will have a ramp placed strategically on one side of the road. If hit correctly, the car will fly to one side, and eventually land on a secret roadway. Also, jumping off these ramps can also lead up to overhead bridges on some routes. These secret roads can usually lead to a quicker way to the next route.

Trivia:

Out Run 2019 was originally being developed for the Mega CD/Sega CD as Cyber Road. Development was later moved to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, where it was renamed Junker's High before eventually becoming Out Run 2019. In 2005, Out Run 2019 was re-released as a TV Games device - Play TV Legends Outrun 2019 from Radica Games. One notable thing about it was the included steering wheel controller.

    <desc>OutRunners is a sequel to the classic arcade racer OutRun. It puts you behind the wheel of 8 different race cars with the aim being coming up first on a world-wide cross-country racing tournament.

As mentioned you get to select from 8 differently tuned cars, each with different handling and speed specs. and then ride out in hopes of getting the trophy. At the end of each stage you get to select between different branching routes that determine what your next stage will be, and thus the different routes you take to the end game determine what ending you get (if you manage to beat the other players).

OutRunners places a big emphasis on competitive gameplay as you are always racing against another car, be it an AI or human-controlled one in a perpetual split-screen multiplayer mode.

Trivia:

The arcade original featured up to 8 simultaneous racers by linking four 2-seater cabinets.

Hints:

- Play as the Virtua Formula -
One the title screen, take controller one and enter this code: LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, C, A. You'll hear a noise if it worked. Press START and choose the Arcade Mode with button C. To the left of the first car is the Virtua Formula. Wait for the pictures and stats of the cars and you'll eventually see the Virtua Formula Car. (Note: This trick works on an early version of the game. It may or may not work the same on later versions.)

    <desc>OutRun is an arcade game developed by Sega AM2 in 1986 for specially designed hardware. It was designed by Yu Suzuki, and is often considered a milestone in the driving/racing genre, being ported to numerous home playforms and inspiring several sequels. Rather than be classed as a "racing game", Yu Suzuki classifies OutRun as a "driving game".

OutRun was a pioneer in video game graphics, audio and arcade cabinet design, picking up multiple awards during the late 1980s. It was the best selling arcade game of 1986 with over 20,000 cabinets sold worldwide.</desc>

    <desc>A combination of Pac-Man and Tetris, Pac-Attack mixes the ghost-gobbling action of the former with the falling block puzzle aspects of the latter. Your job is to maneuver the blocks into lines so they will vanish from the screen. Ghosts also fall from the top of the playfield, getting in the way of the solid lines you are trying to form. Luckily, Pac-Man accompanies the falling blocks from time to time, allowing you to maneuver him into a position to munch the ghosts. 

Similar to Tetris, the Normal mode of play in Pac-Attack continues until the blocks and/or ghosts have stacked up to the top of the playfield. Each ghost Pac-Man eats adds a little gold to the Fairy Meter. When the meter is full, a fairy jumps onto the screen and throws a gold dust spell, effectively removing all the ghosts below it. The 2 Player VS Game features head-to-head, split screen action. Here the winner is the player who lasts the longest in two out of three rounds.

Gameplay:

In the Puzzle game you complete a level when you have gotten Pac-Man to eat all of the ghosts. If all of the ghosts have not been eaten after a certain number of blocks and ghosts have fallen from the top of the screen, you lose. You can retry each of the 100 levels again and again, and a password feature lets you save your progress.

Hints:

Enter password JFK, and you get the game ending as well as the credits.

    <desc>Although it doesn't offer anything spectacular in the way of graphics or sounds (the music is downright silly for a war game), P.T.O. (Pacific Theater of Operations) is a satisfyingly realistic simulation that lets players act as Supreme Commander in WWII of either the Japanese or Allied Forces. The turn-based action, which relies heavily on tactical maneuvering and strategic command decisions, involves planning attacks, launching air strikes, managing a budget, implementing a draft, and much, much more. The game boasts a sophisticated mapping system for plotting your course, 250 ships based on those that fought during the war, and nine historical scenarios, including the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway.

    <desc>Everyone's favorite yellow chomping circle of a being is back and upgraded in Pac-Mania. Just as in the 1980 classic, you control Pac-Man through a maze as he attempts to gobble up all of the onscreen pellets before a ghost captures him. 

As one might expect from a sequel released seven years after the original, there are several new features in Pac-Mania. Right away you'll notice that what once was a 2D maze with 2D characters is now 3D in both respects with a diagonal tilt. Also, you now have the ability to jump over the ghosts in your way, some of whom will tail you ruthlessly.

The cast of ghosts includes those from Pac-Man and 1982's Ms. Pac-Man -- Clyde, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Sue -- as well as Funky, a new character blessed with the ability to jump like Pac-Man. Instead of just four ghosts as in the orignial, expect up to six of them onscreen at once, each with his or her own personality.

If things get too hairy, keep in mind that each corner of the maze houses a power pellet that will enable you to turn the ghosts into your next tasty treat. Its effects only last a few seconds, though, so make the best of this time. Other delectable edibles include green power pellets (speed boost), red power pellets (double points) and fruit (extra points).

Once all pellets in a level are devoured, you'll move on to the next, harder one. But if you trust your skills, you have the option of starting as high in the game as round four.

    <desc>Caught in a violent storm, Richard Tyler crashes his bicycle into a tree, leaving him dazed and confused. He shrugs off the wreck and goes to the nearest building which happens to be the library. But this is no ordinary library. This library is a world of horror, fantasy, and adventure, crawling with animated characters derived from the many stories contained in the books lying and flying about. The librarian, a mysterious man called The Pagemaster, informs Richard that in order to return to the outside world of reality, he must find the library exit.

As Richard Tyler you must run and jump your way through 68 levels of bats, ghosts, pirates, skeletons, fire creatures, and other nasties from the world of literature. In addition to jumping on top of and over your enemies, you'll find weapons such as gooey eyeballs, a pirate's sword, and magic dust. To help you in your quest through the magic library, you'll find magic shoes for jumping power, sticky hands for enhanced climbing ability, helmets for temporary invincibility, skulls for extra height, and of course books, which can you can arrange as you like. At the end of each level, a 3D bonus flying game puts you in the air collecting gold tokens (100 gives you an extra life) and magic dust.

    <desc>The fairy kingdom has long been threatened by the dark witch Wool, the leader of the Dark Undulation. The queen Velvet sent the cute little fairy Silk to seek aid by the red-haired witch Cotton, the only one who could defeat Wool. Cotton agrees under one condition: she will receive some willows as a reward, since willows are her favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, she begins to chase the mysterious enemy.

"Panorama Cotton" is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter reminiscent of Space Harrier, set in an anim?-style fantasy world. Various levels scroll "into the screen", vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can move Cotton over the screen, shooting at oncoming enemies and avoiding obstacles on her way. Cotton can upgrade her weapon to higher levels as you advance in the game, and can also cast magical spells by collecting special items.

    <desc>Who ever said that being a paperboy was an easy job? In Paperboy 2, find out just how hard it can be! As either a paperboy or a papergirl, your objective is to avoid the obstacles that come with the job of delivering papers as you toss them to subscibers' houses. Failing to get the papers to these houses will result in their cancelling their subscriptions and you possibly losing your job. At the end of your route is a bonus round where you can rack up some extra points. Extra points can also be attained by accurate throws, breaking non-subscribers' windows, stopping burglars and runaway baby strollers, and watering sunbathers.

    <desc>In Paperboy your job is to ride your bicycle through the neighborhood, throwing newspapers into subscribers' mailboxes or onto their front porches. If you miss one of the target homes, that particular household will drop their subscription. Vengeful paperboy that you are, you can break the windows of nonsubscribers' houses for extra points.

The life of a paperboy in this game is tougher than you might think as the neighborhood is probably a little different than your own. While delivering papers, you will be assaulted by lawn mowers, tornadoes, workmen, breakdancers, dogs, and even the Grim Reaper. You can avoid these enemies or throw papers at them for extra points. There are also obstacles you must deal with such as trees, tires, grates, fire hydrants, fences, garbage cans, and man holes. And if that's not enough, cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles cruise recklessly down the street, hoping to run over you. After you finish each day of your daily route, you will enter a training course. In this timed bonus round, you must avoid obstacles, jump ramps, and throw newspapers at targets.

    <desc>The first hoops game to appear on the Genesis, Pat Riley Basketball features two modes of play: Exhibition and Tournament. You can choose from three game times (20-minute, 48-minute and 80-minute), two game speeds (Normal and Slow) and two types of defense (Man to Man and Zone).

Due to the lack of an NBA license, no real players appear in the game. Instead, there are eight generic teams (such as the Los Angeles Hoops and the Dallas Wings) with five faux players on each team. Players are rated according to speed, shooting accuracy, passing ability and defensive skill. 

Stats are kept for points scored, shots taken and fouls committed. In addition to fouls, there are numerous infractions you can commit. These include out of bounds, traveling, over and back, 5-second violation, 10-second violation, and 24-second violation. There are no substitutions in the game (therefore no foul-outs), but you can switch the positions of your players as needed.

During slam-dunks, free throws and three-pointers, the camera angle switches to a graphically enhanced close-up of the action. To sink a free throw or dunk, you must accurately stop a ball that moves on a meter bar. On defense, you can block shots (including dunks) and steal the ball.

Trivia:

This game borrows heavily from Double Dribble (1987) for the NES. Pat Riley has coached for the Los Angeles Lakers (where he won four NBA titles), the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. When not coaching, he is a highly paid motivational speaker.

Controls:

D-Pad: Move player with ball or signal direction of pass attempt when on offense, move player marked with arrow when on defense
Start: Pause/unpause
A: Call time out during dead-ball situations, select players in position-charge situations
B: Shoot or dunk ball, attempt to block dunk shots, move control arrow to player nearest ball when on defense
C: Pass ball to teammate, throw ball in from out of bounds, steal ball from opposing player in mid-dribble
A, B, or C: Tap ball in center-court tip-off before each quarter

    <desc>Now you can golf on one of the most famous courses in the world with Pebble Beach Golf Links for the Genesis. Licensed by the Pebble Beach Company, the game features 18 holes of fairways, greens, bunkers, cliffs, water traps (including the ocean!), sand traps and other staples of professional golf. 

Five gameplay options are available: Practice, Skins Game, Stroke Play, Match Play, and Tournament Play vs. 48 Top Golfers. You can create up to ten players and change the names of the fictional pros to anything you want. A battery backup saves stats, such as tournament scores, longest drives, putts per round and much more.

You can choose from 14 different golf clubs. If you need advice, you can rely on your caddy to suggest the club with the most appropriate range. A power meter lets you hit the ball at the desired strength and height, and along with your stance, determines whether you will hit the ball straight, to the right or to the left. Wind speed and direction and the lie of the ball are also things that you should consider when preparing to hit the ball. 

Other features in this game include instant replays, a leaderboard, green grids (for help in aiming putts), hole fly-bys, and multiple camera angles.

Trivia:

Pebble Beach has been rated as the number one rated public golf course in America. It was the site of the 1992 U.S. Open.
Golf videogames have been popular since Golf hit the Atari 2600 in 1980.

    <desc>The Europe-only sequel to Pete Sampras Tennis, Pete Sampras Tennis '96 includes new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joins the previously available Grass, Clay and Hard courts. 

Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction. 

The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder). There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament ("Party mode" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).

    <desc>Pete Sampras Tennis offers a unique way to play with four players without requiring an adaptor: the game has two input plugs at the top! This device is called a J-Cart, which is the first cartridge to include support for two additional joysticks or gamepads.

Besides letting you play with up to four players, the game offers four modes of tennis: Challenge (one singles or doubles match), Tournament (four to eight players with byes), World Tour, where you'll play in 33 cities around the globe, and Tutorial, which explains all of the game's controls.

Pete Sampras Tennis also includes three court types (grass, hard and clay), 32 different computer players with individual skills and appearances, instant replay, and a continue option via passwords. Over 4,000 frames of animation will show dives, backhands, serves, runs, volleys and forehands, and an umpire will call the game as a crowd looks on.

    <desc>The 8-Meg PGA European Tour updates 1992's PGA Tour Golf II with five new courses, ten new professionals to play against, and an eight-player elimination tournament. These features go along with everything found in the previous Genesis PGA Tour game, including the horizontal swing gauge and draw and fade meter. The featured European Tour players are as follows: Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, J.M. Olazabal, Tony Johnstone, Ian Woosnam, Sandy Lyle, Rodger Davis, Ronan Rafferty, Colin Montgomerie and Constantino Rocca.

Players can participate in a Practice Round, 72-hole Tournament (against an additional fifty European roster players), Skins Challenge, Match Play, Shoot-Out, or work on their long or short game on either the Driving Range or Putting Green. As in PGA Tour Golf II, you can save your golfer to battery along with statistics such as earnings (in pounds), average, Best 18, Best 72 and number of wins. Curious about the European courses? Players can compete at the Wentworth Club, Forest of Arden, Crans-sur-Sierre, Le Golf National and Valderrama.

    <desc>PGA Tour 96 represents a significant departure from previous games in Electronic Arts's popular Genesis golf series. The links are now modeled in 3D, allowing for visible slopes and varied terrain instead of the straight, flat courses in earlier titles. A new swing meter replaces the tried-and-true horizontal bar, appearing as a blue arc just behind your digitized golfer.

Once you press the button to begin the shot, a line will move up along the arc simulating the natural motion of a backswing: hit the button again to determine power and once more for accuracy. If you don't time the swing correctly, you'll either hook or slice the ball depending on where the line falls on the arc.

The three authentic courses include the TPC at River Highlands, TPC at Sawgrass and Spyglass Hill GC. Players can create their own golfers or elect to play as or against one of ten different PGA Tour pros (with statistics based on the 1994 season): Brad Faxon, Fuzzy Zoeller, Craig Stadler, Jeff Sluman, Mark O'Meara, Davis Love III, Bruce Lietzke, Tom Kite, Lee Janzen and Peter Jacobsen.

The five play modes consist of Tournament (against 56 additional roster players), Match Play, Skins, EA Shoot-Out and Practice. Those who would rather get a feel for the swing meter can also "visit" a Driving Range or Putting Green to work out the kinks. Rounding out the package is battery backup to record statistics (both individual and course), tournament progress and created golfers.

    <desc>In PGA Tour Golf III for the Sega Genesis, you can choose from these Tournament Players Club courses: Summerlin, Sawgrass, Avenel, Scottsdale, Southwind, River Highlands, Las Colinas, and Woodlands. Prior to entering a tournament, where you must compete for cash against 60 professional golfers and up to three friends, you can hone your skills in the practice round, the driving range, or the putting green. Tournament play includes a Skins Challenge, Match Play, and the EA Sports Shoot-Out, which is a three-hole elimination contest.

When you are getting ready to hit the ball, you must decide if you want to hook or slice the ball or if you want to hit it straight, depending on the lie of the ball, what obstacles are on the course, and what your follow up shot is going to be like. You must also decide what club to use, how much arc to put on the ball, how hard to hit the ball, and what effect the wind will have on the ball. When putting, you can look at a contour grid, which shows the topography of the putting surface.

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive Sega Net game entitled "Phantasy Star II: Anne's Adventure". It sports a variable-width font engine with kerning and, as usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English, depending on the country code of your machine.

Once, long ago, some folks who could both english and japanese realized something. The script for one of the greatest 16-bit RPGs of all-time had been butchered in its English translation. Which is quite a pity, to be sure. So some fellows going by Hirata and Zickefoose rectified it by tranaslating the game into English, and stick it in a text file somewhere. Then Naflign steps in. He adored Phantasy 2 (as anyone in their right mind SHOULD), and set about hacking this script into the game. And guess what?! He met with success. So now, you can enjoy Phantasy Star 2 in it's proper english glory.

    <name>Phantasy Star III: Generation Of Doom</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>It's the day of your wedding, and everyone is very excited, not the least of which is you. You're marrying Maia, the mysterious woman found on the shores of your father's kingdom. Suddenly, a giant dragon swoops into the hall and takes flight with your fiancee! 

Being the noble prince, you give chase to rescue your beloved. Here starts your journey into the savage worlds of Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom. Starting as Prince Rhys, you must battle your way to save your beloved through seven different worlds, and uncover a conspiracy far worse than you ever expected.

Spanning seven worlds, and three generations, you must find and confront this evil. At the end of each generation, choose who you'll marry, and in turn get a different quest. It's up to you to save the world, you and your following generations. Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom contains four different endings for added replay value, and numerous quests and challenges.

Hints:

- Improve late-game character stats -

A glitch in the game will allow you to make either Laya or Kara always act first in battle and be immune to physical attacks, as well as moderately improve the speed and defense of the rest of the party.

The glitch is activated in Skyhaven, when changing the Legendary weapons into Nei weapons.

1. Decide who you want to always act first and be immune to physical attacks - Laya or Kara.

2. Remove all items from that person. 

3. Make sure everyone else has their appropriate Legendary weapon equipped (Orakio Sword, Miun Claw, Siren Shot, Laya Bow, Lune Slicer).

4. Speak to the second from the left old man, who says "Nei is the word of ultimate power".

5. Check your status screens. For the person who had no equipment, attack and defense should be in the 64,000 range, and speed in the 220 range. For the others, the attack, defense, and speed bonuses of the Legendary weapon they had equipped will be permenantly added to their base stats. (Unfortunately, none of the increases to the attack statistic have effect on damage dealt in battle).

The only way the person with 64,000 defense will be hurt is from a Gnasher (who will do a whopping 4 damage) or from techniques (which are unaffected). She will always act first.

There are 3 side effects which may appear alarming but are in fact harmless.

1. Colours will be unusual - this will be corrected once you check your menu and leave Skyhaven

2. Last person in line will be shifted out of place - this will be corrected once you leave Skyhaven, and the out-of-line person will not prevent you from moving

3. Characters will be renamed - this is permanent but harmless.

- Skip Nial's Generation -

An escapipe glitch allows players to skip over Nial's generation directly to playing Aron. Aron will need to do some of Nial's quest, but it goes much faster and easier with Aron, thanks to his healing and access to the Aero Parts.

1. As Rhys, before fighting the king of Cille, make sure Wren or Mieu has an escape pipe.

2. After defeating the king, select Nial's route by marrying Lena. (Do not choose Maia as the glitch does not work for Ayn.)

3. As soon as the cinema is over and you can move, go into your menu and use an escapipe.

4. As Nial, you will warp back to Cille dungeon. Walk through it again (you will encounter only Chirpers). The king and Maia are waiting in the same place as for Rhys, defeat him once more (an easy task with full HP/TP and a stronger leader). 

5. Select Aron's route by marrying Alair. (Do not choose Laya because Adan will be unable to complete his quest.)

At this point you play as Aron. The Sub Parts, Laya Pendant, Twins Ruby, and Mystery Star that Aron come with are "fakes" that do not work, so Aron will need to collect the real ones as Nial would have.

6. Collect the Aero Parts as normal.

7. Fly to the rebel hideout and pick up the Sub Parts.

8. Go to Hazatak using the caves to Landen, Aquatica, then Aridia.

9. Get Laya as normal.

10. Go to Mystoke and get the Laya pendant.

From this point on finish the game as normal

Full English release in typical MIJET fashion. That means, VWF, dual language support by region, and top quality work. No known issues. A patcher program is available on the author's website if you prefer it over the typical IPS patching solution.

Update:

A major overhaul of what some critics are calling "the Blade Runner of very short text adventures."

    <desc>This is a thorough alteration of Phantasy Star II for the Sega Genesis that changes nearly every facet of the game. It slightly lowers the difficulty from the notoriously difficult original, it now ties-in better with the rest of the classic Phantasy Star series, with a completely rewritten story, and the great surprise veterans have wanted for over a decade! So newcomers and veterans alike, come enjoy the Numan Revolution! Features:

- Every piece of equipment has had some alteration done to it, from a different strength or opened to use by new characters. There are even many new ones!

- All the characters learn more Techniques.

- The guns have been given major improvements to be better than many bladed weapons and some award defensive bonuses.

- An all-new storyline!

- Every shop inventory has been changed.

- All the enemies give double Experience and double Meseta in comparison to the originals to speed the pace of the game.

- Each character levels up at a different rate, and the weaker ones get massive boosts from level 35 and up.

- Brand new monster sprites and a new enemy!

Description

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive Sega Net game entitled "Phantasy Star II: Shilka's Adventure". It sports a variable-width font engine with kerning and, as usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English, depending on the country code of your machine.

    <desc>In the dark, vast reaches of space, light years from the planet we call home, floats the Algo Star System. It contains three planets, and the middle one is a green, hospitable world called Mota, gripped in a web of insanity.

Phantasy Star II is a role-playing experience like no other. Featuring complex plot twists, numerous characters, and a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy elements. Join forces with Hugh the Biologist, Shir the Thief, Kain the Wrecker, Rudo the Hunter, and many others as you try to unravel the mystery of why Mother Brain has let the planet fall apart.

Controls:

Start Button: Pause; unpause
D-Pad: Move cursor, move player
A Button: Talk to townspeople, advance dialog box, inspect objects
B Button: Cancel command, close selection box
C Button: Open update box, open selection box, activate commonds in selection box

Hints:

- Become invisible -
In battle, get all of your team members KO-ed except for Nei. Then get Nei to cast Nasak and she should KO herself. Then, your characters will turn invisible and you can walk around dungeons freely. 
(This works in all version of PS2)

- Make the game scroll one frame at a time. -
When paused, press C and one frame should go by.

- Slow motion play -
When paused, press and hold B and play as normal. The game should play very slow.

- Switch game music -
This trick allows you to have different music play in other areas, using the slow motion code. First, you go to the area that has the music you want, like the weapons shop for instance. Next, press start and hold B. The game will move in slow motion with no sound, so you can still move. Now, then go to another place and let go of B, then press Start. The music from the place where you first pressed B and Start now plays in this area! Cool glitch!

- Equip armor glitch -
It is possible to have armor equipped even if it is not in your possession. First make sure you have at least two pieces of armor in a characters possession.
1. Go to the equip screen and highlight the armor you want to keep equipped.
2. This is the tricky part...equip/unequip the armor...when it says ".....takes armor" press a confirm button and then QUICKLY press down to the next armor below it and equip/unequip that armor. You need to do it
fast enough so that you see only a little change in the attack,defense, and/or agility from changing equipment.
3. You'll know if the glitch worked because you won't be able to unequip the first piece of armor. Now you can give the armor to another character! Who says you can't have powerful equipment like the NEIMET on just one character?
To cancel the glitch, simply equip another piece of armor over the affected armor slot.
It may take a few tries to get the glitch working because the equipping/unequipping must be done very quickly.

- No random encounters -
When examining the nearby area with the A (Talk, Examine) button, the next step you take is guaranteed not to take you into a battle. Keep hitting the A button (Talk, Examine) while you walk, so that after every step it will say ''There seems to be nothing unusual here.'' No random encounters will happen, but it will take quite a while to maneuver through dungeons this way.

    <desc>PSIV Arranged Version is a slightly more difficult version of PSIV. The main differences include a significantly slower EXP/MST gain in addition to new item and weapon uses. The goal of this romhack is not to force the player to grind for more levels and cash, but simply to force him or her to examine dozens of options that the game makes available to the player that may have otherwise been overlooked in a normal playthrough.

    <desc>When the central computer system of Palma, Mother Brain, exploded 2000 years ago, the planet was destroyed. Other planets under the control of Mother Brain were affected as well, including Motavia, home of Chaz the Hunter. The deterioration of Motavia most notably included the creation of horrendous Bio-Monsters. As Phantasy Star IV begins, Chaz is not aware that it is in his destiny to not only stop these monsters -- but also to save the galaxy.

Though Chaz is the game's main character, he is by no means the only one. Many characters are under your control in the game, up to four at a time in a single party. Your quest involves performing many tasks for people in various Motavian towns (and other planets later), learning more about a much larger quest as you go along. There are several comic book-like cut scenes that evolve the game's story (along with a fair share of plot twists). As the game progresses, the party will encounter countless enemies, helping them to gain experience and thus become more effective warriors. Chaz's specialty is with blades, but the eclectic abilities of the other characters will enable you to use powerful magic and other weapons as well.

Controls:

D-Pad: Move characters
Start Button: System menu
A Button: Camp menu
B Button: Cancel selection
C Button: Search area, open containers and doors, talk

Hints:

- Music Test -
Complete the game, and then press B at the ''Start/Continue/Erase'' screen.

- Level 99 Glitch -
If you ever happen to get a character to reach level 99, this odd glitch will occur. Instead of putting a level cap, when you reach level 99 all of your characters will be leveled down to around 40~50. And everytime you should go up a level, your character will go down another level. Although your stats screen will still say you are level 99.

    <desc>Rebecca Madison is lurking somewhere in Metropia. This is a problem. She is bent on taking over the world, as so many evil characters are, but this time she has the resources to do it. Rebecca is head of Maximum Incorporated, a business specializing in biotechnology; a business specializing in death. As Kit Walker, aka the Phantom, you must traverse over 60 levels spanning the city of Metropia to stop her.

A map screen will let you choose a sector you want to explore, but don't expect a safe trip. Armies of biots are programmed to attack you! The Phantom can scale walls and swing from ceilings with his inductance rope, fire homing missiles from his smart gun, and even drop special pellets that explode on contact.

There are 14 weapons and five items in total, and you have the ability to control two weapons at a time. An inventory screen allows you to store all of the items and weapons collected for later use. Phantom 2040 also features 20 possible endings based on your performance during the game.

Trivia:

"Phantom 2040" is based on the cartoon series of the same name, which was an early Batman Beyond-like adaptation of the classic Phantom character set in the future.

Created by the legendary Lee Falk and first appearing in february 17th, 1936, The Phantom started his many adventures to rid the world from piracy and evildoers following the footsteps of his ancient lineage as the 21st "Walking Phantom" in the world. In practically no time Falk's newest creation rose to world fame under the King Features Syndicate banner, which placed it in tons of newspapers around the world (Falk was already a major-league player from his earlier success: Mandrake the Magician, and thus commanded true star treatment from his publishers) and remains to this day a well-known classic of comic book history. 

The character also made the leap out of the comic books many times, with a collection of 15 serials in 1943 from Columbia Pictures, an animated series in 1986 (along Flash Gordon and Mandrake) as well as a motion picture starring Billy Zane in 1996 by Paramount (besides the aforementioned Phantom 2040 animated series which had the particularity of being helmed by Peter Chung of Aeon Flux fame). So far this is the only videogame adaptation of the long-running franchise.

    <desc>Television is no longer enough for Pink Panther; he wants to be a Hollywood movie star. During his first audition, the Pinkster manages to spoil a scene starring the famous Inspector Clouseau. Feeling like his chances at stardom are ruined, the inspector seeks revenge. He chases Pink Panther through the various back lots of Hollywood studios, wrecking the sites of such movies as Pinkenstein, Pink Beard and Cat on a Hot Pink Roof. While running scared through the movie sets, Pink Panther must dodge or kill everything from rats to dinosaurs to animated cowboy boots. Luckily, he's armed to the teeth. His arsenal includes a detonator, a fly swatter, a sledgehammer, a can of bug spray and other useful weapons. Also, he can jump on the various critters to get rid of them. To assist Pink Panther in his getaway, toll gates are available. When Pink Panther drops a coin in the toll gate, he gains access to another level or platform.

The game offers you the chance to play the role of a pirate in six different game scenarios or careers, each beginning with a different time period in history.

Choose from the following: 1560s' The Silver Empire, 1600s' Merchants and Smugglers, 1620s' The New Colonists, 1640s' War for Profit, 1660s' The Buccaneer Heroes, or 1680s' The Pirates' Sunset. You can also select your nationality, difficulty level and one of five special abilities your character will possess, including fencing, navigation, gunnery, medicine, or wit and charm.

After typing in your family name, you'll have to first win a duel on board a ship before you can start sailing from an overhead view of the Spanish Main. You're then left to your own devices on how to play the game. Earn titles by fighting for kings of different nations, battle ports, attack and acquire bigger ships, hire crew members, sell goods or even search for buried treasure.

Besides starting a new career, you can assume command of one of six famous expeditions, practice sword fighting or view the Hall of Fame of top pirates. Up to four games can be saved to cartridge, so you can resume your buccaneering whenever you feel the urge to pillage and plunder. Just make sure you have enough rations to last your trip and gold to divide among your crew!

    <desc>Developed for both Genesis and Super NES, this colorful combat game from Sunsoft is based on the Saturday morning cartoon show of the same title, created by David Kirschner. Each of the three main heroes from the animated series is playable: Ren, the beleaguered prince of Octopon; Tula, the supernaturally gifted "Ecomancer"; and Ioz, the battle-hardened former pirate. In the roles of these characters, players fight against the villain Bloth and his nefarious brigands as they side-scroll through eight stages of combat and action, in search of the Treasures of Rule. As in earlier 2D combat games, such as Double Dragon or Final Fight, two gamers can play at once on the same screen.

    <desc>Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a side-scrolling action game in which you play adventurer Pitfall Harry Jr in search of his father Pitfall Harry. You battle your way through the Mayan jungles, waterfalls, deserted mines and can bungee jump and boomerang your way to safety. There are 13 levels and the action is fast and gripping. You will need to be attentive-and quick. Or prepare to die.

Trivia:

Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure utilized the initial release of DirectX and was one of the first PC games to be released as a native Windows 95 executable.
Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is based upon the groundbreaking Pitfall!, which Activision released to the Atari VCS in 1982.

    <desc>Pit-Fighter is a no-rules, unregulated fighting game which lets you control one of three digitized fighters: Buzz, a body builder and former pro wrestler; Ty, a kick-boxing Pit-Fighter veteran; and Kato, a speedy, very agile Karate expert. Each character has three super moves. In addition to fighting with fists and feet, weapons such as sticks, knives, crates, and garbage cans are available throughout the game. As you progress through the levels, you'll eventually face ten different fighters, each of them with unique abilities and fighting techniques. The fights take place in seven different areas: a warehouse, a garage, a subway station, a high-rise building, a bar, a freeway overpass, and a wharf. Like most fighting games, the one-player game is a series of one-on-one fights. The two-player simultaneous mode, however, differs from the norm in that instead of fighting each other, you and your gaming partner fight two of the bad guys. As the fights play out, a crowd of anxious spectators cheer. If you get too close to the audience, you get shoved back into the middle of the action.

    <desc>Take control of the title character or her little raccoon friend, Meeko, in this adventure based on Pocahontas, the Disney animated film from 1995. Pocahontas must learn the nine special animal spirits as she ventures out into the wilderness to prevent a war between her Powhatan tribe and the English settlers. The game is separated into three acts and takes place in the forest, at the long house of Chief Powhatan, at an English settlement, inside a ship, and in various natural Virginian surroundings. 

When the game begins, Pocahontas can walk, climb, short jump and push objects, while Meeko can run, climb trees, jump, jump into Pocahontas' arms, push small objects and tread water. In order to gain special powers (such as night vision, swimming and sprinting), Pocahontas, with the help of Meeko, must free nine animal friends from various predicaments. Switch between the pair at any time and use each character's strengths to figure out how to reach the end of the level.

Various puzzles appear throughout each level as you explore your surroundings. For example, you cannot simply enter the front door of the long house, so you must find another way in. Ledges sometimes appear to be out of reach and some objects seem impossible to move. These and other puzzles await your gaming expertise. Players can resume progress by entering passwords awarded at the end of each level, and cinematic cut-scenes help further the story as the characters advance through the game.

Trivia:

Released to theaters in 1995, Pocahontas tells the story of a brave and free spirited woman who defied her tribe and her father (Chief Powhatan) by falling in love with an Englishman named John Smith. Voice actors for the film include Irene Bedard, Judy Kuhn and Mel Gibson.

    <desc>Arrggh no! Nintendo's annoying electric mouse and his mates make it onto the Genesis in this surprisingly enjoyable platform game, shocking...

The Hong Kong Pirates have obviously spent a lot of time on this one for a change, it has great graphics and above average level design, even if it does rely a little too heavily on leaps into the unknown. Features all the usual platform game elements and you can dispatch the other pok?mon by either jumping on their heads in the usual manner or by lobbing the pok?balls you find scattered around the levels at them. All the pok?mon are actually recognizable too although one or two do seem to have been "borrowed" from other games, the bunny for instance looks very much like it's been lifted straight from Mega Bomberman. They took the part about Picachu being a mouse a little too seriously though because when he turns to face you he sports the most amazing set of teeth, even Bugs Bunny would be jealous. You can bet if Nintendo know about this games existence that they're not very happy.

    <desc>Populous for the Sega Genesis gives you the power to completely control a world, bestowing you with the gift to control natural disasters like volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, and fires. You must also prepare lands for settlement and expansion. The larger the settlement, the more advanced it becomes.

With great power also comes great responsibility, so it's up to you to defeat the forces of evil in a showdown at the Armageddon. You command a group of loyal followers who obey your every whim. Send them into battle, or make them build a castle for defense. It's your decision. 

As you build strength and gain followers, your powers grow and so does your ability to crush the dark enemy. No one ever said being a god was easy, but Populous makes it possible to live out the ultimate supernatural fantasy. Five hundred worlds are yours for the conquering.

    <desc>In this game you take on the role of 1 out of 8 teams who represent various nations vying to become the Powerball champions. Powerball is a game consisting of a hybrid of sports such as American football, soccer and rugby. You play on an 100 yard field trying to score on the opposing team. Scoring consists of either running into your opponent's end zone holding the powerball for a touchdown or kicking the ball into your opponent's net to score a goal. Goals are worth 1 point, and touchdowns are worth 3 points. The game modes are 1 or 2 player exhibition play, and 1 or 2 player league play. League play allows you to use bonus points, and distribute them to your teammates to improve their statistics.

Hints:

- Extra Teams -
To gain access to four extra teams, press B, B, C, B, B, and C during the team display screen.

- Level Passwords -
Enter the following code at the Password Screen.... 
1st Championship: PUDCR 
2nd Championship: CMOPE 
Semi-Finals: BFOOE 
Finals: OADBR 
Then you should go to your desired level

- Sound Test -
Go to the ''League Continue Mode'' and choose China as your team. Now enter the password KWGEN and hit start. You'll now have a Sound Test option.

    <desc>Overview:

Power Drive is an arcade racing game based around rally driving. Handbrake turns and lurid powerslides are both possible, and the steering is suitably loose.

There are 3 types of stages - individual time-trials, head-to-head races against the computer, and some skill tests. There are 8 rounds of gameplay, set across countries ranging from Sweden to Kenya. You get prize money for winning races, and it costs money to repair damage.

    <desc>Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

Gameplay:

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game. Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.

Hints:

- Conquest Password -
Select the ''Restore Conquest'' option and enter the password 2MNOA2WSD. Now you should be able to select any of the 195 territories on the map.

- Last Level Password -

    <marquee/>
    <desc>In this game based on the 1990 movie starring Danny Glover, you play the role of Lieutenant Michael P. Harrigan as you investigate the strange murders in the city of Los Angeles. Adding to the difficulty is the ongoing war between Colombian and Jamaican gangs, not to mention reports of some peculiar creature hanging around the area...

Predator 2 is an angled overhead shooter consisting of seven levels. The first level has you blasting gang members while making your way through the urban streets trying to find nine hostages. After rescuing the downed officers, find the exit and you'll be taken to the rooftops to fight it out with armed helicopters and even more gang members. Rescue fourteen hostages and you'll be able to progress to the next level.

Subsequent levels all involve rescuing a certain number of hostages while fending off the repeated shots of rival gang members. You'll also have to deal with the invisible Predator, who will try to target you with its laser sights (resembling a red triangle). Keep moving to avoid it and you just might live long enough to see the next level!

The goal of the game is to eventually confront the creature(s) on board the alien ship. Yet in order to make it that far, you'll have to find the following equipment (Harrigan automatically carries a pistol with unlimited ammo): rifle, scatter gun, sawed-off shotgun, grenades, flak jackets (life meter increases to 100 percent) and first-aid kits (extra life and full health).

Before you are ready to confront an alien, you'll need to first acquire its weapons, including a spear, flying disk and net. As you might have guessed, ordinary guns or grenades cannot harm Predators. Three difficulty levels (normal, hard or easy) will determine how many lives you start with as well as the amount of damage you can take before dying. A password system lets you continue your pursuit of the Predator aliens through seven hostage-filled stages.

    <desc>Premier Manager 97 is the second Mega Drive game in the hit football managing game series of the early nineties. Similar to the first run of games in the series (released between 1992 and 1994), the manager starts (in the Full Game mode) as a lowly division 3 (not Conference) manager, where the goal is to get the club to the top divisions, or get signed to better placed teams. In the Demo mode, the player can choose any Premier League team, but only for a season.

In either of the modes, the player is responsible for carefully assembling the team (and unlike other managers, selecting the appropriate tactics is crucial to win the game), get the best from the transfer market by selling the fading stars and outselling the biggest clubs in England in the quest for the stars of the future, improve stadium capacity and quality (including seating, roof, security and others), sign good deals for ground advertising and balance the budget to make the team finish the season out of the red.

Matches are always simulated, with a ruler showing where the ball is, and with text messages showing actions (like "player passes", player tackles" and so on). The chances of goals are shown in LED-style animated clips.

    <desc>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.

    <desc>A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world.

Primal Rage is a one-on-one fighting game featuring dinosaurs and giant apes as the fighters. The graphics are done with digitized stop-motion animation. Gameplay is similar to Mortal Kombat in that it is viewed from a side perspective, and features deadly finishing moves at the end of the match.

Trivia:

There was going to be a sequel Primal Rage 2 but due to poor sales it got cancelled. However Atari felt it need a sequel in one form or another so the book written John Vornholt called Primal Rage: The Avatars was made instead of a second game.

    <desc>In this sequel to Sega's NFL '95, Prime Time NFL Football starring Deion Sanders increases the difficulty, expands stat tracking to over forty categories, and adds a record book that saves top individual and team performances around the league. 

These complement established features such as the NFL and NFLPA licenses, all thirty teams including Jacksonville and Carolina, star players such as Troy Aikman and Steve Young, as well as player stats based on the 1994 season.

Prime Time also allows you to create, sign or release players, toggle injuries, customize playbooks, choose weather conditions, relocate any team to any city, play multiple schedules, and save up to fifteen user records.

View the action from 65 yards down the field so you won't miss that single coverage on third and long. Make the plays as the quarterback or elect to become the receiver at the line of scrimmage. You've played the other games, but are you ready for Prime Time?

    <desc>In an hour the princess must decide: marry the Grand Vizier Jaffar or die. You are the only one who can save her, but you've been arrested and thrown in the dank dungeons far below the palace where the princess nervously waits in a room at the top of a tower. You escape the guards' clutches, but you have a long way to go to rescue your true love and depose the cruel tyrant who rules his land with an iron fist. To get there, you'll have to leap across bottomless chasms, avoid spikes which shoot up from the floor, and battle nasty swordsmen.

Played in real time, Prince of Persia gives you exactly one hour of game time to master its secrets and reach your objective. Using animation modelled after the movements of real people, creator Jordan Mechner has crafted an intriguing game which not only looks wonderful, it has the feel of an old adventure film, with you in the title role.

Controls:

D-Pad Left or Right: Turn around, run left or right.
A Button + D-Pad: Take careful steps, strike with sword.
B Button: Jump, block.
D-Pad Up: Jump up to ledge.

    <desc>Pro Quarterback is an arcade-style football game with a view just behind the quarterback, allowing you to see down the field without the use of passing windows. Choose between 26 professional caliber teams and challenge either the computer or a friend on one of six different field surfaces: grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf. Want to team up against the computer? Pro Quarterback also allows for cooperative play with one person playing QB and the other controlling the receiver. After the kickoff, select from seven plays on defense or up to eight plays on offense, which can be flipped to keep your opponent guessing. The game also has instant replay, adjustable quarters (2, 5, 10 or 15 minutes) and game statistics updated during halftime and at the end of the game. Gridiron fans take note: Pro Quarterback does not feature an NFL or NFLPA license to include real teams or players.

    <desc>Psycho Pinball is another pinball game in the style first introduced in Pinball Dreams and later popularized in Pinball Fantasies. Standard features of these types of pinball simulations include an animated backglass display, multiple bonuses including a multi-ball, extra ball, etc., and background music that changes based on active specials.

There are three main tables:

- The Abyss (Aquatic theme)
- Trick or Treat (Horror theme)
- Wild West (Western theme)

...but an additional gimmick is a fourth Psycho Pinball table (circus theme) that has bonuses that can launch you to the other three tables, leading to massively high scores (and very long gameplay times).

Hints:

- Extra ball -
To get an extra ball pause the game and press Down, B, C, B, Right, Right.

- Play mini games -

    <desc>Puggsy is a platform game with a combination of action and puzzle-solving elements. You control the the creature Puggsy, who has crash landed on an alien planet and had his spaceship stolen. Your goal is find the spaceship so you can get off the planet and return home. To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments. Throughout each level are a variety of objects which you can pick up; on many of the levels you will need to figure out how to use the objects available to you in order to reach the exit. Some objects can used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked. Of course, each level will also have a variety of bad guys wandering about which will cost Puggsy one of his lives if he's caught. On your quest there will also be six evil guardians which will need to be defeated before you get your spaceship back!

Trivia:

The Puggsy character originated in a series of demo animations made for the Amiga in the late 80s and early 90s. As you may gather from this, the game was originally planned for release several years earlier. In the animations Puggsy was silver rather than red; Nik Wild of Psygnosis claimed that the change was made to help people with black and white TVs.

Pulseman is an electric hero who was created to fight cyber crime. Combat the galaxy gang throughout 7 stages with around 50 levels. Pulseman is best described as a fusion between the gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man in ways of gameplay.

Translation Description:

As seems to be standard practice with MIJET's work, the patch contains both the original Japanese and the English translation. The correct translation is chosen based on the region of your Genesis or emulator internally thanks to some ROM Hack wizardry. Check the readme if you're interested in getting an inside look at the hacking from the author's perspective.

As for the translation itself, it's stellar work as usual. There wasn't much text in the game (the readme states a mere 22 strings), but it was all handled with tender loving care, which shows brilliantly. Strangely enough, there is some spoken English in the game, but that's translated. In addition, all instances of Engrish have been fixed.

Overall, this is a very nice translation, and since it's the only one for this game, I highly recommend it.

    <desc>Puyo Puyo is a Japanese puzzle game developed by Compile as a spinoff to their Madou Monogatari series of RPGs.

The original Puyo Puyo was released in 1991 for the MSX2 computer and contained a basic one-player free-play mode, missions, and basic two-player mode. However, Sega and Compile worked on a heavily expanded version for the Sega System C-2 arcade board and released it in 1992. This version has been ported to various consoles, including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System, and Sega Game Gear, and has formed the basis for the entire Puyo Puyo series.

In North America and Europe, it was initially released in a heavily localised form, the Sega version being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.</desc>

    <desc>While Uncle Scrooge naps, Donald Duck is flipping through some old books in the library.

Waaack! Out falls a strange piece of paper from one of the books. It's a long-lost message from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom. He's hidden his most prized possession somewhere on earth. And he's left a map that leads to its whereabouts!

"I could be rich! Richer than Uncle Scrooge," Donald thinks to himself. But Big Bad Pete and his Ducky Gang are lurking outside the window. They're about to snatch the map, but Donald dashes away, safe for the moment.

"Donald, you're late!" Daisy scolds. "But Daisy, some-thing fabulous is waiting for me!" Donald squawks. "If I can find it, it will be a terrific surprise for you. I'll tell you all about it when I get back!"

If he comes back! Donald has no idea what dangers surround the hunt for the Great Duck Treasure. He only knows that he'll do anything to find it...

--From the Genesis Quackshot Starring Donald Duck instruction manual.

Overview:

I never knew how ineffective a bathroom plunger was as a weapon until I used one against a man with a bazooka. Sadly, Donald only has such outlandishly stupid weapons to use against people armed with the best weaponry money can buy. Normally I advise to charge forward, but what idiot would do so armed only with bathroom plungers, popcorn shooters and bubblegum blasters? Donald Duck comes to mind.

Yeah that's your arsenal, but if the job were easy a former American President would probably take it. But here we have the famous and frighteningly demented Donald Duck to the rescue. If he doesn't just freak out and bust a hole through your computer screen, you just might win the game.

As the moose should have told you at the entrance, Donald has found a treasure map and is on a worldwide search for Vidalia onions (no, of course not, treasure). He encounters numerous bad guys that he must defeat with his limited weaponry and even more limited intelligence. Donald travels first class on an aircraft piloted by his three nephews Pebbles, Bam Bam and Dino Huey, Dewey and Louie to ten exotic locations (if you consider downtown Duckburg exotic) such as Duckburg, Mexico, some Aztec Ruins, Translyvania, a Viking Ghostship (dark and moonlit - hint, hint), the South Pole, the Maharaja's Palace, Egypt (notice, not the Egypt), Ducky Gang's Hideout and Great Duck Treasure Island.

The game opens like a movie, which is original. Great graphics, as should be expected with most SEGA games. The manner in which you must win the game, moving back and forth through locations, is also original, making the game non-linear. I give it a 90, Mr. Clark. Easy to dance to and the words make a lot of sense.

Directions:

Donald chooses locations from the map to travel to and is transported to them by aircraft. He must fight his way through the locations, finding helpful objects that will assist him in his adventure, until he arrives at a place where he cannot continue without a special weapon or item.

This point is called a "checkpoint," and it is from here that he can call his aircraft. Hopefully a friend there will give him a clue as to what he needs, or the object needed will be obvious. He plants his flag (this is where he will return to when he comes back to the location), calls his aircraft, and travels to another location in search of the object.

Weapons:

- Yellow Plunger - 
only stuns bad guys for a few moments, but you get an unlimited supply

- Red Plunger 
fights foes and lets Donald climb obstacles (he's a Duck that talks but doesn't fly)

- Green Plunger 
sticks to critters that can fly, unlike ducks  Donald finds it on a dark night while looking for his courage

- Popcorn Shooter 
loaded by picking up corn items

- Bubblegum Shooter 
break downs obstacles  Gyro Gearloose has the ammo

C Button: Jump / Choose Weapon

Hints:

- Pepper Madness -

- Checkpoint -
The box to the left of the points meter on the information bar will start flashing when Donald is near a checkpoint.

    <desc>Here it is... the amazing conversion of the smash arcade sensation brings screaming-fast car racing to the Genesis! Pound the pedal and grind those gears, down the straights and around wicked hairpin turns. Whip through hairy S-curves, gut-flipping loop-the-loops and crazy corkscrews! With three cars to choose from, multiple music tracks and cool sound effects, Race Drivin' brings arcade-style auto speed competition to the Genesis!

Gameplay:

The gameplay resembles a driving game, featuring a car similar in appearance to the Ferrari Testarossa. The screen shows a first person perspective from inside the car, throgh the windshield. To separate it from other driving titles of that era, stunt loops and other road hazards were added. The game generally consists of 1 or 2 laps around the stunt track. In certain modes, the player races against the computer controlled car, Phantom Photon. The game challenges the players in a daredevil fashion and broke away from traditional racing games like Out Run or Pole Position. Stunts, a racing game produced later, has similar visuals, controls and tracks.

It also features a realistic manual transmission mode and force feedback steering wheel, in which the driver would have to properly operate the car as they would in real life.

A notable feature of the game is the "instant replay" display that is presented after a crash, which sets Hard Drivin' apart from most driving games of its time, which after a crash would just put the player back on the road, stopped, and let them accelerate again. Before resuming play after a crash, Hard Drivin' would run an approximately ten second animation, captioned "Instant Replay", which showed a wide aerial view of the movements of the player's car and surrounding vehicles leading up to the crash, with the player's car always centered on the screen. During the replay, the player could not change the action on screen, but the replay could be aborted to immediately get back to active gameplay. The replay would continue for about two or three seconds after the crash, showing a polygon-rendered fireball and the movement of the car, including any spinning, flipping, or bouncing off the struck obstacle.

The replays add to the appeal of the game and actually add a motivation to crash in spectacular ways in order to see them played out from the aerial view. Besides collisions, a non-survivable landing after going airborne (even if the car landed right-side up), or even going too far off-road, could cause a crash which would be replayed like any other crash, with the car even exploding into the same orange fireball. The game tracks the player's progress around the track by invisible waypoints (denoted by flags on the course map showing the player's progress when the game ends due to time running out), and after a crash, the car is placed back on the track at the last waypoint passed; this sometimes is a significant distance back from the point of collision. (One of the waypoints on each track was the marked checkpoint about halfway around, which when passed granted the player extra time.)

Race Drivin's approach to collisions or unrealistic events-putting the car back on the road at a standstill-was the norm for driving games until later games such as Cruisin' USA and its successors introduced intentionally artificial physics to force a car to always stay near the road and land right-side up pointing forward.

After going goes off-road, the player has ten seconds to return to the road, or else he will be stopped and returned to the road, at a standstill, at the last waypoint passed (just like when a crash occurs, but without an instant replay.)

    <desc>Radical Rex is a fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus on a skateboard who has to save the dinosaur race under the spell of an evil creature. The game consists of 10 levels set in the prehistoric age. Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.

    <desc>In the year 2090, Earth is invaded by extra-terrestrials. The World Alliance of Nations has developed a supersonic attack fighter, Raiden, to defend the Earth. A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them.

Gameplay:

The formula of the game is simple and typical for the era of this game. The player pilots the "Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter" through waves of enemies, and several levels. There are two types of weapons, and the player can collect several powerups for them to make them stronger. There are bombs and missile powerups as well as collectable medals which add to the score.

- Fighter -

Raiden fighter always starts with vulcan main weapon.

When player dies, the fighter drops items, based on the former fighter's weapon powers.

- Weapons -

    - Main weapon. There are 8 weapon levels:

        - Vulcan: Fires wide formation shots (max 7 directions).

        - Laser: Fires forward-concentrating shots.

    - Sub weapon. There are 4 weapon levels:

        - Homing Missile: Fires enemy chasing missiles.

        - Nuclear Missile: Fires forward-concentrating missiles. When it hits an enemy, the blast persists for a short period.

    - Bomb: Destroys bullets on screen, and damages enemies in the blast area. There is a moment of delay between pressing bomb button and explosion.

When a player's fighter shoots the other player's fighter, the attacker's projectiles transform into 'stars' that radiates from the attacked fighter.

When player dies, the fighter's fragments become projectiles that damage enemies.

- Items -

    - Red icon: Switches main weapon type to vulcan main shot. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - Blue icon: Switches main weapon type to laser main shot. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - H: Switches sub-weapon type to homing missile. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - M: Switches sub-weapon type to nuclear missile. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - 1UP: Increases life stock by 1.

    - P: Maximizes both main shot and sub shot levels, assuming the fighter has the weapon type. If both shot type powers are already full, players gets 10000 points.

    - B: Increases bomb stock by 1. If player already has 7 bombs, player gets 5000 points.

    - Medal: Increases score by 300.

    - Miclus: Increases score by 3000.

    - Fairy: Increases score by 10000.

- Stages -

There are 8 stages in the game.

When continuing after all players are dead, player resumes from a predefined check point.

At the end of each stage, player gains stage bonus equals to the number of medals gained in a stage with current life, multiplied by number of bombs player possesses, multiplied by a 1000. If medal or bomb stock is 0, the count is equal to 1 for each affected field for scoring purposes.

After defeating the Stage 0 boss, the mission is completed, and player receives 1 million points for each completed loop. Afterwards, it will start back to Stage 1. This time around, enemies shoot faster and at a more rapid rate.

Hints:

1. AKWT-AA9J Infinite bombs

2. AE9A-AAF0 Start with 1 bomb

3. A29A-AAF0 Start with 6 bombs

4. BA9A-AAF0 Start with 8 bombs

5. AJFT-AA5C Infinite lives

6. PFCA-BJXG Each bomb power-up item is worth 2

7. AEIT-AAHT Some smaller obstacles easier to explode

8. AHEA-CAGY Some bigger obstacles easier to explode

9. BA9A-AA8E Don't lose missile power when you lose a life

10. A69A-BE8E Permanent invisible missiles

11. BBCT-BA5Y First laser power-up item gives you maximum power.

    <name>Rainbow Islands: Bubble Bobble II</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Rainbow Islands is a 1987 arcade game from Taito. The game is subtitled "The Story of Bubble Bobble 2" and is the sequel to Taito's hit game Bubble Bobble from the previous year. It is the second of four arcade games in the Bubble Bobble series (followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories, but itself has two direct sequels: Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2). The game was ported for numerous home computers and game consoles.

The basic premise of the game is that each level is an island which is slowly sinking into the sea. The player must therefore get to the top of each level, by jumping on platforms and making use of the game's most distinctive feature: the ability to produce solid rainbows, which are used both as platforms to stand on, and as a weapon.

One of the features which sets this game apart from many others (and has no doubt been responsible for the game's popularity) is its 'hidden depths'. While initially appearing to be quite a simple game, Rainbow Islands in fact has a vast number of secrets for the player to discover, including secret levels, secret power-ups and riddles. Because of these elements, completing the game properly requires a large amount of dedication from the player. The scoring system also has secrets, which allow vastly higher scores to be achieved than normal.

Gameplay:

The game is set on a chain of ten islands, each one with a different theme. Each island provides four rounds of gameplay, and once these are complete the player moves to the next island in the chain. The islands get progressively more difficult, with enemies moving much faster on the later ones. These are depicted on a map screen before the start of each island. The three secret islands are not visible until all 7 big diamonds are collected. Most consumer versions of the game completely lack the secret islands.

The main characters are Bubblun and Bobblun, the protagonists of Bubble Bobble (known as "Bub and Bob" in the western releases). However, in this game they appear in their human forms as "Bubby" and "Bobby", as opposed to the "bubble dragons" of the first game. Also unlike the first game, players must now "alternate" (i.e., take turns), with player one as Bubby (green shirt), and player 2 as Bobby (blue shirt) (as with the first game).

Hints:

- Start the game with virtually infinite lives -

In the option menu, choose number of lives and select '0'. Then you can start your game normally. When you died, instead of Game Over, you get a lot of extra lives like ??, ?! and other symbols in pair as your number of lives. However, it is not really unlimited. After you died a lot of times (about 400 times), your number of lives became 99, and when it reached 0, the game is over.

    <desc>- The Rescue -

Hand-to-hand combat! Grenades bursting! Machine guns rattling! Explosions, smoke, and the faces of men suddenly caught dead by a bullet.

These pictures burn in the mind of a man helping to build a simple temple in the mountains. The man is John Rambo, private citizen, former Green Beret. In Vietnam, Rambo earned his rep as a hero who couldn't be stopped, even in the face of impossible danger. Now he spends his days in a forgotten village, struggling with the anguish of memories he can't shake.

But today a stranger appears at the temple. "Rambo" the man says, "I've been looking for you"

Rambo stares at the speaker. The pain of the memories fades as he recognizes his old friend.

"Colonel Trautman!" Rambo says. "Why are you here?"

"Because I need you. I'm going into Afghanistan on a top secret mission. Right now the border is crawling with Russians. But I've got to get in there! You're the only one I can trust to get me across the border alive!"

Rambo's heart cringes at the idea of more war - for what! He gazes into the distance, remembering past horrors.

"Sorry, Colonel. My war is over."

Deep in a night-shrouded mountain pass somewhere between Pakistan and Afghanistan, three jeeps led by Colonel Trautman attempt to cross the border. Suddenly the sound of raging thunder surrounds them. A Russian Hind helicopter is in pursuit and firing! Before they can reach cover, two jeeps are hit and demolished! Then a voice booms out: "You cannot escape! Drop your weapons now!"

"Trautman's been caught!"

Hearing this, Rambo starts to boil with anger. All through Vietnam, Trautman was the only one who understood his deepest feelings. The Colonel was like a father to him. Now his life is at stake! If only Rambo had gone with him into Afghanistan! If only... if only...

Rambo turns to the agent who brought him the news. "I'm going after him! I want you to get my supplies. They've got Trautman, and now they're going to get their worst nightmare!"

--From the Genesis Rambo 3 instruction manual.

Directions:

Your mentor, and the best fry cook the U.S. Marines ever had, has been taken captive, so what must you do? Save the Colonel! Do you need anymore reason that that? So to get you started on your missions I give you the following information:

When you have selected the explosive arrow, the longer that you hold the "B" button down, the more powerful it becomes.

Explosive Arrows work against towers but not ammo dumps and conversely, Time Bombs work against ammo dumps but not towers.

Missions 1, 3, 5 and 6 have bonus rounds that you must win in order to advance.

Charge your explosive arrows to the fullest; jump out at the proper time and fire at the tank and helicopter! Simple Enough!
     
Special Objects-

Smiling Faces in a box give you extra lives

An "A" in a box gives you a Bow and Arrows

A "B" in a box gives you a Time Bomb

Hero or Baby? Which shall it be? Heroes will ignore the following information and just fight like the real Rambo would do while Babies, who just want to win, have no choice but to use these cookbook directions. Babies make me SICK!

Mission One-
After killing all the commies, blast your way through the gate with machine gun fire and explosive arrows. (OK, Baby, aren't you ashamed? You could have figured that out by yourself if you hadn't been so worried about your dirty diaper)

Mission Two-
OK Sissy, you will need to fire your machine gun (not your milk bottle) at the cells until the Secret Agent identifies himself. When he does, the place is about to blow up so get out quickly by blowing up the exit.

Mission Three-
You have to destroy the guard towers with timer bombs (like I was going to use oatmeal) and use machine gun fire to break through the gate.

Mission Four-
This is Real Rambo Rampage Time! You have to destroy EVERYTHING until some hokey ratio reaches 100%. (10,000 dead commies and I still only got a 98%!)

Mission Five-
He's at it again! Destroy the tanks and helicopters using fully charged explosive arrows (is there another kind?) and kill everybody (except for yourself - you are a psychopath, not a suicidal mental patient).

Mission Six-
You Whiny Babies make me so sick I shouldn't even tell you what to do! But here goes: search through the maze until you find the Colonel (you know, the guy that didn't need cheat notes to get here. Wait a second, he has been captured. Maybe cheat notes would have helped him). 

Gameplay:

Based on the film of the same name, this game puts you in John Rambo's shoes as he travels to Afghanistan to free Colonel Trautman from the Soviets.

In six missions, Rambo must complete various objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, prisoners must be freed and enemy ammunition supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an overhead perspective and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous crossbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies.

After some of the missions, the perspective switches to a view behind Rambo and additional boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or helicopters must be destroyed using the crossbow. While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other obstacles from enemy fire.

Controls:

A Button: Select Special Weapon
B Button: Use Special Weapon
C Button: Fire Machine Gun
Start Button: Start / Pause

Hints:

- Your Friend The Knife -
Knifing certain soldiers gives you extra lives

- Limited Invincibility -
In Mission 2, go to the destructable box up and to the far left from the starting point. Proceed to the left until a little shiny bit of the box is showing. Destroy the box with an arrow, making sure there's no enemy soldiers on the screen. As soon as there's an impact, walk left as far as you can with a trail of smoke behind you. You will be invincible until you reach a bonus stage where you can be killed, or until you destroy another box.

You play as a robot fighter called EX-CP who shoots at specified targets in a level while destroying the various enemies and ammunition you may encounter. You can move left to right freely (so if you miss a target you can go back) and can either walk or hover up and fly, but will come down automatically after you release up or stay up too long.</desc>

A wicked group has invaded the "Skyscraper" and has tried to make it their own. If the situation is left as it is, the place would eventually be controlled by the wicked group.

Gameplay:

Rastan Saga 2 is the sequel to Rastan, containing the same hack-em'/slash-'em gameplay as the original. You are a warrior who must get through a number of levels, and trying to collect gems which can only be obtained by defeating the end-of-level bosses. Collecting power-ups along the way awards you with extra life or better weapons.

RBI 3 also has every major league team available from the 1990 season, as well as postseason teams from 1983-1989. A regular season feature was available for RBI 3. Players could choose one team to compete against every other team. All star teams and postseason teams were eligible for this season mode. Passwords were given after each game to help players complete schedules. Once all teams had been defeated, the player had to compete against a fictional all star team from Japan, which included players with incredible HR and AVE stats and pitchers that could not be hit.

    <desc>Red Zone, known as Hardwired during development, is a Sega Mega Drive game released in 1994 by Zyrinx. It is noteworthy for achieving sprite rotations, 3D vectors and full motion video; things that were often considered impossible to do on Mega Drive hardware. Zyrinx were previously responsible for Sub-Terrania, and the two games share similar graphics and logos.</desc>

    <desc>Good evening, Mr. Phelps. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to undertake a perilous rescue mission to the Adrianne star system. The planet has been laid waste by corporate raiders from the Wellmax company, who are even now going planetside to conduct a mopping-up operation for the few survivors hiding out in the city's tunnel system. Time is limited, so the decision to act must be made immediately. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds....

Only the boys from Liverpool could pull off a funny little arcade game that manages to combine the best of both the platform and shooter genres. The attempts at humorous stabs of various financial personages and events is stilted, but it's still a fun game to play. It's a shame that Sony chose not to distribute it, because it sure is a neat little piece of work.
