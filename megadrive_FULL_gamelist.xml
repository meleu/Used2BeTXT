    <desc>3 Ninjas Kick Back is a platforming game developed by Malibu Interactive and published by Sony Imagesoft in 1994 for the SNES and Sega Genesis (ported by Psygnosis) exclusively in the US to tie in with the 1994 film of the same name. It was bundled with Hook in the 3 Ninjas Kick Back / Hook compilation for the Sega Mega CD.

You play as one of the three main characters in the film. Your goal regardless of which character you choose is to assist an old samurai in retrieving a prized dagger from an old rival. To do so, you must complete a series of levels, each requiring you to complete a certain task (sometimes with a time limit) before continuing.</desc>

    <desc>Greetings, terror-trainees! Ickis, Krumm, and Oblina will have to prove themselves on the Monster midterm exams if they want to call themselves real monsters! They must work together as a team to receive a single gruesome grade on their frightful performance. So...go out and petrify someone!

I know what you're thinking, "A game based on a Nickelodeon cartoon, not good." But you'd be wrong, it's actually not that bad. You can switch between the monsters you control (3 in total), and with each monster you get a different group move, giving advantages such as high jumping and looking ahead.

There was a lot of detail put into these levels, such as broken up pieces of stereos, televisions and God knows what, appearing anyway and everywhere.

The music is very simple, boring and repetitive. However it's very quiet compared to most games, so I'm guessing they knew it was bad and turned down the volume for our benefit. How nice of them!

Directions:

The main objective here is to collect an item that the teacher of your monster academy wants you to find. However, it's really just a simple start-to-finish platformer with a boss at the end. 

There are other items other than the main goal item that you can collect, most that you'd find at a real dump, e.g. open tin cans, broken records, discarded flowers. When you collect these items, the number next to the fish bones will increase. This is for how many times you get to use one of the monsters' specials (see controls for specials). You also get the standard every game power-ups, 1-ups, and health power-ups.

The boss battles are nothing special, just watch how they move, jump over them/run under them, and chuck something.

There are various things to hurt you as you travel through the dump: cats, maggots, sewer pipes, etc. You have a life gauge in the shape of a heart in the top left corner, when that depletes you're dead and you go back to the start of the level or an un-marked checkpoint.

To fend off enemies and bosses, you have 2 main weapons that you can use: throwing trash, and scaring your enemies to make them run away. Scaring them is the limited weapon and trash is unlimited, how that's possible I do not know.

There are various differences with being each monster: for example, if there is a low ceiling of spikes, you can only pass under it safely with a short monster and not the tall one. However, the other main difference is the special moves (I don't know the monsters' names, so bear with me). With the tall candy cane-like monster, you can either get your other monsters to use her as a ladder, or, if you are near a wall, you can boost yourself up onto a ledge. The short fat one with his eyes in his hands can throw his eyes onto another part of the level so that you can see ahead, obviously they were trying to put some strategy into this otherwise easy game. Lastly, the shortest one will throw you ahead if, say, there is a large gap that you cannot jump. 

Controls:

A Button: Scare
B Button: Throw trash
C Button: Jump
Down+A: Switch Character
Up+A: Special move

The game would be followed by Addams Family Values, though this is a top-down game rather than a sidescroller.</desc>

    <desc>The evil Debbie Jelinksi is harming the Addams family once again... She has kidnapped Baby Pubert, and Uncle Fester is the one who must find him and to bring him back to his loving family.

"Addams Family Values" is an action adventure game with slight RPG elements (you gain more hit points while proceeding in the game, can upgrade your equipment and special attacks). You control Fester, by moving him around, fighting regular enemies and bosses, talking to members of Addams household, and occasionally solving puzzles. The combat is pure action, Zelda-style.

    <desc>D&amp;D Warriors of the Eternal Sun is an excellent game. Unlike most of the D&amp;D games on the early platforms, this game was a lot of fun to play and fairly easy to control. Round based combat with the option to move your character as well as decide what action to take was a stroke of genius. It gave us D&amp;D players a flashback to playing for real. It also used the same D&amp;D rules we are used to. The graphics were pleasing to the eye and the sounds were wonderful. The score for this game was one of the best I've heard. It really made you want to go out and adventure. There were also a lot of secrets to find with great rewards like magic items and weapons. The map isn't too big, but there is still a lot of game-play to be had. I think you will find yourself walking the length of the map a good many times. D&amp;D Warriors of the Eternal Sun is a great RPG. If you like D&amp;D, or if you are just a fan of all RPG's, give this game a try!

Directions:

Save the kingdom from complete madness and find some allies in this strange new world. 

Controls: 

A Button: Cancel

Hints:

Easy Experience
Go to any one of the caves and when you get inside kill the monsters there. After you've done that, go outside and come back in. The same monsters will be in the same spots for you to kill again. Do this as long as you like.

Advanced Busterhawk Gley Lancer, commonly known as Gleylancer, is a 1992 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up by NCS released exclusively in Japan (despite having some of its text, such as in the Mover configuration screen described below, in near-perfect English). It was released internationally on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008. Despite the English configuration screen, translation group M.I.J.E.T. released a patch which translated the story text in 2006-2007.

Lucia is the 16-year-old daughter of a fighter pilot who disappears while fighting a war between humans and aliens in 2025. He was captured by aliens whom he had captured earlier who had the ability to teleport. Lucia hijacks the prototype fighter CSH-01-XA "Gley Lancer" to save him.</desc>

Bleh! If you've played one Daisenryaku game, you've played them all I think. This one certainly has a lot more going for it in terms of presentation, that's for sure. Unfortunately, my ineptitude at console wargames is made painfully obvious once again. When you can't win at Fall Weiss, you know you suck.

Translation Description

This patch translates all the dialogue and all briefings completely into English. All that's left are some splash screens, but this patch is marked final, so these apparently won't get translated.

    <desc>This is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel. The game plays out much like an episode of the show. The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum. Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

So, Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls. Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show.

    <desc>Aero the Acro-Bat 2 is the sequel to Aero the Acro-Bat, and was released for the Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo in 1994. The SNES version was released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2010. Like its prequel, the game follows the adventures of Aero, a bat tasked with saving the world from Edgar Ektor.

There are several improvements over the original game, such as more moves, cutscenes that progress the game's story in between each world, and a password system that allows progress in the game to be saved.

The story starts directly after the events of the original game, where Aero had knocked Edgar Ektor off of a tower. After knocking him off, Aero leaves to explore Ektor's museum, finding a mirror which brings him to an ancient castle. Meanwhile, Ektor's henchman Zero manages to save him before he hits the ground, and tells Zero to prepare a 'Plan B'.</desc>

    <desc>Aero the Acro-Bat is a platform game developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Sunsoft for the Sega Mega Drive and SNES in 1993, with a port for the Game Boy Advance released in 2002. In 2010, the SNES version was made available on the Wii's Virtual Console service. In the game you play as the bat Aero, who needs to stop the mad scientist Edgar Ektor who is trying to rid the world of amusement and fun.

The game features 4 worlds, The Circus, The Funpark, The Woods, and the Museum. All worlds except for The Woods have 5 acts and a boss act. Most acts require the player to accomplish a certain goal before finding the exit, such as falling through a number of magic hoops or rescuing a captured circus performer, although a few only require Aero to find the exit before advancing to the next act. It is another '90's platformer trying to latch on to the popularity of Sonic or Mario.

The game was reasonably successful, and therefore saw a sequel, Aero the Acro-Bat 2.</desc>

The game is essentially the same as its prequel, however now features a throttle control which allows the player to adjust his/her speed during gameplay. There are also three new stages, bringing the total to 21 and various gameplay and music tweaks.

Whereas the original After Burner saw ports to simpler video game consoles/computers such as the Sega Master System, After Burner II was ported to more advanced 16-bit systems including the Sega Mega Drive, J2ME, and TurboGrafx-16. After Burner II also saw release as part of the Sega Ages: Volume 1 compilation on the Sega Saturn, and is playable within Shenmue II.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Up until the movie Aladdin was released, the licensing rights for adapting Disney characters into video games were handled separately for the Sega and the Nintendo consoles: Sega released some games featuring Disney characters (like Castle of Illusion, or Quackshot) but didn't adapt any movies or series. Meanwhile, Capcom adapted exactly those series and movies for their rival Nintendo, exclusively. This changed in 1993, when Virgin was allowed to create a game based on the movie Aladdin, which was critically praised. Capcom, however, still held the rights to do an adaptation on their own. So the Genesis and the Super Nintendo saw both their own version of Disney's Aladdin, both based on the same movie but produced by different companies. Later Disney adaptations would be handled by Virgin for both consoles following the release of The Lion King in 1994.

So this Aladdin II is not a game based on the TV series or some sort of sequel, but rather a retelling of the same story. Other than using the same story, however, the two games are different in almost every regard. So, keeping above in mind, it's quite understandable why the people responsible for porting the Super Nintendo game to Sega's 16-bitter would opt to call the game Aladdin II. It is, in fact, the second Aladdin game on that console. And as far as ports go, this one actually is pretty accurate.

The game mechanics have remained the same as they did in the Super Nintendo original: Aladdin can throw apples (which he can collect throughout the levels) to stun enemies or dispatch smaller foes. Enemies are generally defeated by jumping on them. Bosses can take several hits. The programmers managed to get the game controls down pretty well, although they occasionally seem a bit sluggish. Also, the collision detection seems to be a bit off, but it's bearable, albeit irritating at times. However, in order to fit the game on a 16-Meg cartridge, the porters have decided to make some changes.

The first noticeable one would be the new title screen  although this has probably just been done in order to remove all copyright notices referring to Capcom or Nintendo. More importantly, however, is that the programmers have removed quite a number of sprites. The snipped a few frames out a few characters animations, which leads to some jerky movement. This becomes particularly apparent during boss battles. The first boss hardly seems animated at all whenever he strikes with his sword, and the last battles against Jafar require play totally different since the attack patterns have changed (for example the moving floor has been removed out of the very last boss battle). Some minor character sprites  like one-time foes, or background sprites like Apu, the walking animations of the magic carpet, or the appearance of Jasmin at the end of level one have been cut entirely.

Some changes do influence the gameplay a bit, however. The password option has been entirely cut out of the game, so you have to play through it in one sitting. Further, the SNES version had a Scarab in most of the levels, which served as a mid-level save point. The omission of these Scarabs means that there are no save points either. To offset this, (and in some cases because the programmers didn't manage to pull off a fluent change in the stages background) the porters have decided to cut some levels into smaller stages. Also, where you originally could find a Scarab you now get an additional heart to your life bar. Two levels, which were very dependant on one-time only sprites, have also been cut entirely (Inside the lamp, stage three and the magic carpet ride bonus stage). So, once you master the somewhat jerky controls, the game becomes easier than it originally was overall. 

The port had to take big hits in the sounds and graphics departments. For all the twenty+ levels, there are only three different background tracks in the Genesis version, and I'm positive that I've heard at least one of those in another pirated game (Donkey Kong '99, to be exact!). This music quite often doesn't fit the mood of the stages. For example, a stage with a fiery cave that included fireballs and lava ended up having soothing, slow muzak. Also, contrary to the SNES version, there unfortunately is no multi-layered background scrolling. Last but not least, while the porters did take the background graphics directly from the original game, they somewhat suffered during the port, leading to some ugly artifacts and pixels in the background graphics (as you can see for yourself in these screen shots).

Overall, however, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with this port. It's very close to the original and plays pretty well! Definitely an effort well made (for a hack, anyway).

    <desc>Aladdin is a platform game developed by Virgin Interactive in 1993. It is based on Disney's movie of the same name and was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Amiga, DOS, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and NES. An entirely different game was developed by Sims for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, and another version developed by Capcom exists for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy Advance, as Capcom still held the rights to develop Disney-themed games for Nintendo consoles.

Virgin's version of the game was seen as a milestone for the industry, as all the animations were drawn by Disney artists frame by frame. It meant that Aladdin looked significantly better than most other platformers on the market, and was able to provide gamers with the same graphical style as seen in the film. Many of Aladdin's developers would move on to form Shiny Entertainment, and produce Earthworm Jim.</desc>

    <desc>Alien Soldier is a Mega Drive game developed by Treasure and published by Sega in 1995. It was one of the few Mega Drive games to be released in Japan and Europe, but not North America (however it was made available briefly through the Sega Channel service), and is now considered an extremely rare collectors item. It has since been re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console service, as well as being released as part of the Sega Ages Treasure Box disc for the PlayStation 2.</desc>

    <desc>Alien Storm is a 1990 beat 'em up game released by Sega for Sega System 18 hardware.

When aliens invade earth, it's up to a special forces team known as the "Alien Busters," to get rid of them. The player can play as either Karen, Garth or Scooter and must defeat all the on-screen aliens. The game is very similar to Sega's earlier title, Golden Axe, aside from the futuristic setting and occasional bonus rounds.

Alien Storm was ported to a variety of platforms, including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and ZX Spectrum, most of which being released in 1991. The Mega Drive version of the game was released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007/2008, and was also bundled as part of Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection for the Sony PlayStation 3/Xbox 360. In the Master System version of the game the robot is named "Slammer" and Karen is completely missing. Some versions also call Garth "Gordon".</desc>

Japan: Alisia is the daughter of a sorcerer killed by evil Baldour's followers after her father banished Baldour in a cocoon to outer space, which has since crashed back to Earth, leaving Alisia to defeat Baldour and his followers.

US/EU: Alisia is a female adventurer who is the only one who can destroy the evil delivered by a silver star that has returned to Earth (implied that Earth had managed to deal with it once before).</desc>

    <desc>Altered Beast, called Juuouki in Japan, is a Sega System 16 arcade game released in 1988 by Sega. It was developed by the creator of Golden Axe, Makoto Uchida and shares many graphical similarities as a result. The game was notable as it allows the player could take on the form of "Were Animals".

A year later it was ported to various consoles, including the Sega Mega Drive, which it was bundled with during the console's early years. There was a watered down port for the Sega Master System also, and several ports to non-Sega systems, including console rivals the NES and Turbografx-16.</desc>

    <desc>Arcade Classics is a compilation of three arcade games originally released by Atari during the 1970s and early 1980s. The compilation was released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1996.

As well as providing "classic" versions of the games, there are also enhanced "Sega" versions, which update the graphics. Sadly the games are plagued by framerate issues, slowing down considerably when numerous objects are on screen.

Sega wanted three Atari classics converted to the Genesis with as much integrity as possible. Therefore, the games used in the compilation were based directly off Atari code. The Atari 7800 version of Centipede and Atari 2600 version of Missile Command were converted from the original 6502 assembly language code to the Z80 for the Game Gear version and then from Z80 to the 68000 for the Mega Drive. While all the code specifically associated with sound and graphics had to be re-written, the initial conversions were done using the developer's own 6502 to Z80 and Z80 to 68000 assembly language converters. Pong, a hard-wired console game which was reverse engineered for the Game Gear, was initially converted from the Game Gear to the Genesis using a Z80 to 68000 assembly language converter. The video and sound modules were then rewritten to complete the process.</desc>

It is the only game in Wolf Team's Arcus series of RPGs to receive an international release and the first entry to see release on a Sega system (a compilation of the first three games, which were only released on Japanese computers, was released on the Sega CD in Japan in 1993).

The sorceress Castomira set out to destroy the world, and has managed to defeat all but one of the warriors who have attempted to stop her. That lone soul was Princess Leaty, who engaged in a fierce, destructive magical duel with Castomira that lasted for days, ending with Leaty sealing Castomira in the Dark World using a sword which came to be known as The Power of Leaty. Centuries later, Castomira's followers have stolen The Power of Leaty and plan to return Castomira for the ultimate destruction.</desc>

    <desc>Art of Fighting, known as Ryuuko no Ken in Japan (and South Korea), is a fighting game by SNK, originally released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade and AES home console in 1992. It was ported, among other consoles, to the Sega Mega Drive in 1994. It is the second fighting game to be developed by SNK - a genre they would later be known for, following Fatal Fury (which co-exists in the same fictional universe).

As with Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting took several huge hits when it was brought to the inferior Mega Drive hardware, most notably the Neo Geo's camera, which would zoom in on the players if they were close together. It is also considered to have inferior graphics and sound when compared to its Neo Geo counterpart, but like all SNK games brought to Mega Drive hardware, was still considered at a better deal (as Neo Geo games retailed at $200 new).

No other Art of Fighting games were released for Sega consoles, however most of the characters in Art of Fighting also appear in the The King of Fighters series, which saw many releases on Sega consoles.</desc>

    <desc>Asterix and the Great Rescue is a platforming game developed by Core Design and published by Sega and released in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in the US and Europe. It was the first Sega game to tie into the Asterix series of comic books and other media. A different such game was released for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear.

Gaul is almost completely occupied by the Roman Empire; the only plot of land remaining is the small town where Asterix and his friend Obelix live. While the town has been able to stalemate the Romans in the surrounding areas until then, the Romans did capture and imprison the town druid, Getafix, and their pet Dogmatix in Rome, and the two main characters must now set off to Rome to free them.</desc>

    <desc>Awesome Possum Kicks Dr. Machino's Butt! is a platform game released by Tengen in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive video game console. Inspired heavily by Sonic the Hedgehog and possibly Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, it features a possum named Awesome who must defeat the evil Dr. Machino and his army of robots.

The game has a strong environmental message, involving the destruction of rainforests and pollution. At the end of each stage the user is asked questions relating to the environment or the animal kingdom.

Awesome Possum was not released outside of Japan and North America, and was heavily criticized upon release for having poor physics and controls. The character of Awesome also also provides a running commentary while playing, which was often cited as being annoying.</desc>

    <desc>Pro Moves Soccer is a great game that just about every soccer fan should enjoy, thanks to the simple controls and the ability to make your own team. Despite the cheesy voices, the rest of the game puts that offside and makes it into an otherwise great game!

The graphics are well drawn for a Genesis game, even if animation is somewhat stiff. You see players performing sliding tackles, head shots, rainbow kicks, and even getting taken down. Referees call players over and hold up the corresponding card that they have been issued. You even get a close up shot of penalty kicks. If a player goes down hard, he may need medical attention, at which the medics will arrive on the field to treat him.

A high, scratchy male's voice calls out what goes on, such as the kickoff, offside, fouls, cards, and penalties. Fortunately, you can turn him off. The crowd doesn't make much noise unless there's a shot on someone's goal. The menu music is alright, but it could be better. Even then, you'll still enjoy the game even if you must turn the sound off.

A six button control pad is recommended, but a three button will work too, just you need to pull off two button combos for some functions. Either way, the players move smoothly, and you can pull off things like speed bursts, sliding tackles, elbows/holding, rainbow kicks, headers, passes, shots, GOALS! (OK, so that last one has to be done with some skill and luck involved!

    <desc>Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II or simply Super Monaco GP II is a racing game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1992. It is a sequel to Super Monaco GP, but this time the game is sponsored by Ayrton Senna (who won the Monaco Grand Prix six times). Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer.

At the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular. However, due to these celebrity endorsements, it is unlikely Super Monaco GP II will be re-released without cutbacks.</desc>

    <desc>The plot is very basic. One day, young Baby Bink is kidnapped from his rich parents by clumsy kidnappers hoping for some extra cash if they return the baby to his parents. Well, the baby craws away from the kidnappers, and he goes off into the city, exploring. While he is exploring around the city, it is your job to make sure that he does not get run over by a car, stepped on, etc. You also have to help Baby Bink find his way back to the arms of his mother.

    <desc>
Back to the Future Part III, often simply known as Back to the Future III, is a video game released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System. It is based on the movie with the same name.

An error in the Mega Drive version's palette storage results in the game appearing darker than it actually should be. On the Genesis, the bit order of palette colors is 0000BBB0GGG0RRR0, with RRR, GGG, and BBB being the red/green/blue components of the color and 0 being zero bits. This game, however, uses 00000BBB0GGG0RRR by mistake; the lowest bits of the components are ignored by the hardware, resulting in a color range (000, 001, 010, 011). Because smaller values are darker, the colors will thus appear darker.</desc>

    <desc>Barbie Super Model is a 1993 game for several platforms including the Sega Mega Drive by Hi Tech Expressions tying into the Barbie toy franchise. A prototype ROM for a cancelled Sega Game Gear port also circulates on the Internet.

The goal of the game is to get Barbie around town (by car, on foot, etc.) to prepare outfits for her role as a runway model. At various points (or by collecting various items), you are told to make Barbie look like the picture of a magazine cover, which is made inaccessible to you (making each dress-up a memory game).</desc>

    <desc>Barbie travels all across the United States for her vacation, visiting states such as Wyoming and Florida. Along the way, she goes camping, throws horseshoes, plays volleyball, rides horses and does all of the usual teenage girl stuff. Puzzles are of the simple kind, such as arranging tent pieces or finding hidden presents.

Still, simple games can have better graphics and sound than this one does. The backgrounds look flat, but at least they're bright. The sounds are the usual kiddy game deal, with really... bouncy music, too.

Barbie's Vacation Adventure is a two player game with six different levels. For each activity, you only have to press one button. It is an incredibly easy game.

Barbie's Vacation Adventure is not worth checking out if you're over the age of 10. But, if your little sister needs something to keep her occupied, pick up Barbie's Vacation Adventure for $5.

Translation Description:

All the text in the game has been translated. This includes both dialogue in the story mode and the win/lose quotes in the Battle mode, and the Engrish in the battle mode has been fixed. The patch has been thoroughly tested and works on the hardware. If you find a platform it doesn't work on, contact the author.

There are currently no known bugs. Please note, however, that the patch has only been tested on an American Sega Genesis Model 2. The code has been written in such a way that it should work on all models, though.

    <desc>Barney's Hide &amp; Seek Game is a game that was released in 1993 by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis video game system. It is based on the children's television and home video franchise known as the "Barney" franchise. The voice of Barney was recorded by Bob West, who also performed the "Barney" role on the television show. There are more than one hundred words and two hundred phrases spoken by Barney the Dinosaur. Favorite things are always mentioned by name by Barney when the player helps him discover them. Educational concepts taught in this game include counting, matching, and problem solving. There is a self-play feature that guides the player to the objective when he or she isn't playing. Strangely, despite being an educational game aimed towards pre-school children, this title is not part of the Sega Club series.</desc>

    <desc>Batman Forever is a Batman game developed by Probe and published by Acclaim for the Sega Mega Drive. It is based on the 1995 movie of the same name. It should not be confused with the Game Gear version, which is entirely different, nor Batman Forever: The Arcade Game which is also based on this movie.

Unlike previous entries in the series, Batman Forever uses digitised 3D graphics, similar to Mortal Kombat.</desc>

    <desc>The year is 2049. An alien armada assaults the Solar System. You are a nameless hero whose mission is to board the enemy's main battle cruiser and to disable all sixteen of its main plasma nodes. A special Battle Frenzy chip (code name Bloodshot) is implanted into your neural net, making you the one ultimate soldier on whom the entire humanity depends now.

This is a 3D first-person shooter. You move through maze-like corridors of the alien ship, getting weapons and items, and blasting everything you encounter on your way. There is also a two players mode with split screens.

Trivia:

On the publishing section of Good Deal Games, you can read that the Sega CD version is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sega Enterprises Limited, Domark, or Time-Warner Interactive, who were all involved with the original development.

Battle Mania Daiginjou is the sequel to the game we got stateside known as Trouble Shooter, and, like all good things in the video game world, it was left in Japan. Looks fun though.

Overview:

Two mercenary ladies with a need for destruction. The premise is not of the usual kind of shooter. But the rest is fairly common to all of us: containers with power-ups, flashing shots and a gigantic enemy army.

Typical and reasonably challenging shooter action with some quick puzzles around on certain stages to break the ice. The gamer (playing the role of the mercenary Mania Ohtori, also known as ''Madison'') has the partnership of Maria ''Crystal'' Waneda (whom is equipped with a heavy bazooka) and a weapon pod (which the gamer selects amongst four different types and each one is capable of a devastating attack when activated at a full charge weapon bar). The funny and strange elements of the game, such as the little lab hamster - and others that the gamer will find while delving further into the game, frenetic action and ausence of slomo are its gameplay's greatest assets.

Translation Description:

From MIJET's site:

"In what has become a MIJET trademark, this is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English. However, it goes far beyond simply supporting both English and the original Japanese; it contains two different English translations and a selection of three English fonts.

This patch is contained within two different IPS files, but the only differences between the two are the default script and font to use if none are selected by the user. That's correct; it is possible to select the desired script and font by holding down certain combinations of buttons prior to the Sega logo appearing. See the included documentation for more details."

They even fixed some bugs that were in the original. How 'bout those guys, huh? PLAY THE GAME. :D

    <desc>Noah's Ark

God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt. So God asked Noah to make an ark of cypress wood and bring into the ark two of every living thing of all flesh; they shall be male and female. Help Noah gather animals and food for his long journey before the flood arrives.

Save Baby Moses

The Pharaoh of Egypt has given orders to his soldiers to cast every male baby born to the Hebrews into the Nile River. A daughter of the house of Levi has given birth to a goodly son. Baby Moses is doomed unless you safely carry him to the weeds at the river's edge. There baby Moses will be placed into a little ark made of bulrushes and pitch.

David and Goliath

Young David is in charge of his family's sheep. After finding all the sheep and carrying them to safety, David faces his greatest challenge. Armed only with his sling and stones, David must defeat Goliath, the giant champion of the Philistine army, and save the nation of Israel.

--From the Genesis Bible Adventures instruction manual.

Overview:

Before getting into the game, let me give you a bit of a background on the game's company, Wisdom Tree. A Christian video game company, Wisdom Tree made religious games for the NES, SNES, Genesis, PC, and a couple of others. But the games made were unauthorized and without any kind of permission from either Nintendo, Sega, or what have you. These games were reportedly sold in Christian bookstores rather than video game retail outlets. Many of Wisdom Tree's games were criticized, though, for being dangerously similar to more well known games like Super Mario, Zelda, and Wolfenstein 3D.

Bible Adventures, originally released on the NES in 1991, had been ported to the Sega Genesis in 1995 to the create the game here, giving it new music and updated graphics. The gameplay is drastically similar to the classic Super Mario Bros 2. in that you pick things up over your head and carry them, as well as just the layout being similar. However, this game isn't as easy to control, and using the character you want can often feel slippery. The sound leaves a bit to be desired, too, the music not being all that memorable, and it might annoy you more than anything. If you're into something different from what major game companies authorize, or a pretty big Christian, you can give this a go, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

Directions:

Bible Adventures consists of three different games for you to play: Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath. Here is how you play each of them: 

Noah's Ark: In this game, you play as Noah and your goal is round up two of each type of animal: cows, horses, monkeys, snakes, pigs, and oxen. When you retrieve the animals, you must bring them back to the middle where the ark is, and drop them in (press Up to do so). Some animals you can just walk up to and pick them up with ease, but sometimes you need more effort and this results in you knocking them out with what appears to be a honeycomb. If you somehow find yourself low on health, you can read the Bible verses scattered about the levels to help give yourself more health. Your Inventory will tell you which animals you still need to find and which ones you already have. Be aware that the snakes you are trying to catch are not the same as the ones in the trees that try to kill you. There are several stages to this game, each with a different list of animals to find.

Baby Moses: The Pharoah has ordered that all male Hebrew children are to be killed, but with you as the role of Jochebed, you must get your son, Moses, through the level unharmed. To do this, you have to carry Moses over your head in the same way you would the animals in Noah's Ark. However, you must avoid the hunters, for they can attack you as well as capture Moses. Keep this in mind, though: you can complete the game without bringing Moses with you.

David and Goliath: With you taking the role of David, your goal in the beginning is to capture sheep, again in the same way by lifting them over your head, and bringing them to the pen. However, different animals such as lions and bears will come after you, so you may have to dodge them to avoid being struck. After you complete this portion, you must scale a mountain, all the while dodging guards and creatures as well as tumbling rocks. The last part of the game consists of you in a showdown between both the shield-bearer of Goliath as well as Goliath himself. 

Noah's Ark: In this game, you play as Noah and your goal is round up two of each type of animal: cows, horses, monkeys, snakes, pigs, and oxen. When you retrieve the animals, you must bring them back to the middle where the ark is, and drop them in (press Up to do so). Some animals you can just walk up to and pick them up with ease, but sometimes you need more effort and this results in you knocking them out with what appears to be a honeycomb. If you somehow find yourself low on health, you can read the Bible verses scattered about the levels to help give yourself more health.

    <desc>Bio-Hazard Battle, called Crying: Aseimei Sensou or simply Crying in Japan, is a 1992 shoot-'em-up game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive.

The planet Avaron was plunged into deep biological war, and a retrovirus was synthesized to try to defeat the enemy. Unfortunately, the plan backfires: the planet is rendered nearly inhospitable, and the only survivors of the virus are sent to space to await a time when the new species of creatures that survive or thrive on the virus pose little enough a threat to set up a new colony.</desc>

    <desc>Uchuu Senkan Gomora, is a shoot-em-up by UPL, originally released in 1990 for the arcade, and then ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. While the arcade version was released overseas (in the US under license from American Sammy under the name Bio-Ship Paladin), the MD version was only released in Japan - however an American title screen is present in the ROM and displayable if the region is set to US, which may mean a US release was planned (this is unconfirmed). It is UPL's only Mega Drive game - they would go bankrupt shortly after publishing it (the later Task Force Harrier EX was ported and published by Treco).</desc>

Blaster Master 2 is a direct sequel to the NES game Blaster Master. It was released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993, only in North America.

Blaster Master 2 was handled by a team at Software Creations, rather than internally at Sunsoft like its prequel. The Japanese arm of Sunsoft had at this point tossed aside the Blaster Master franchise due to sluggish sales in Japan, however the game sold very well in North America and so a western-developed sequel was put into production. As such, the original team were initially unaware of Blaster Master 2's existence.

Blaster Master 2 was not manufactured in large numbers, and is now considered to be one of the more valuable Mega Drive games.</desc>

    <desc>Blockout is a puzzle game developed by California Dreams and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. It has also been released for other consoles and computers.

The game can be seen almost as "3D Tetris". The game has a top-down perspective, with the primary objective being to clear "floors" rather than lines. Like Tetris, the player is given a series of shapes made up of cubes, which can be rotated on all three axes. Also like Tetris, if the player's pieces reach the top of the screen (i.e. some floors have gaps in them), the player will lose.

The formula behind Blockout has been recycled and rebranded numerous times, just like Tetris.</desc>

    <desc>Bonanza Bros. is a 1990 arcade game developed by Sega for the Sega System 24 arcade platform.

In the game the player either controls Robo (red) or Mobo (blue), two thieves who must retrieve several objects scattered around levels while avoiding guards in a stealth-like fashion. Each player is armed with a firearm which can stun the guards for a short period of time, but it is also possible to hinder the guards' progress by using various parts of the scenery. It is a two-player game, and the screen is always split horizontally.

Bonanza Bros. was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Master System and Sega Mega Drive in the coming years. TurboGrafx-CD and Sharp X68000 ports also existed exclusively in Japan, and Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum ports were released in Europe. Some westernised versions of the game call Robo and Mobo "Mike" and "Spike" respectively. Likewise North American and Brazilian copies of the game refer to the game as Bonanza Brothers rather than Bonanza Bros..
More recently, Bonanza Bros. was made available through the Wii's Virtual Console service, as well as being made part of the Sega Classics Collection and Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection compilations. As well as this, the game was unlockable within the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection, but was strangely removed from western releases of the game. It has also been ported to various mobile phones by SoftBank Mobile.

The arcade version of Bonanza Bros. was also included in volume 6 of the Sega Ages 2500 PlayStation 2 series. It is bundled with Puzzle &amp; Action: Tant-R and its sequel, Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R, both of which use a similar graphical style (as does Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt, which was not included).

The Bonanza Bros. (Robo and Mobo) are playable characters in Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing.</desc>

    <desc>Boxing Legends of the Ring lets you take control of eight middleweight legends of boxing, Roberto Duran, Tommy "Hitman" Duran, Jake "Raging Bull" La Motta, Rocky Graziano, "Sugar" Ray Robinson, "Sugar" Ray Leonard, "Marveleous" Marvin Hagler and James Toney. You can either compete in an exhibition mode or play in career mode and become the greatest of all time.

The set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow. Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.

There are two main displays during a fight, a damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing gloves, one on each side and as a player connects a punch, the glove will show a black area of where the glove connected and a damage meter that show's the two fighters faces. As the round progresses, the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and is the best time to land your super punch.

Another feature is from round to round, your view will alternate, from looking over your shoulder to the next round and looking at yourself over your opponents shoulder.

    <desc>
Just in time before the years end, the English translation of the Taiwanese unlicensed RPG Barver Battle Saga for the Sega Genesis is finally released! Lots of work has gone into this project, and I hope everyone will enjoy it.

Be sure to check the read me for more about the game, who did what, and all the work that went into getting this game into English :)

About the Game:

Released in 1996 in Taiwan as Barver Battle Saga - Tai Kong Zhan Shi - Mo Fa Zhan Shi, by ChuanPu Technology. The main title, Tai Kong Zhan Shi (literally translated as Space Warrior) is what Final Fantasy is called in Taiwan, a clear attempt the makers made in order to catch peoples attention. After all, Final Fantasy on the Genesis sounds pretty nice :) 

The game was later pirated in Russia under the name Final Fantasy. Unfortunately the company who produced that version were apparently not well versed in Russian, as the resulting translation is notoriously bad, possibly indicating an  automatic translator was used. While making a translation of the Russian version maight have been a much simpler task than its Taiwanese original, due to how horrible the Russian was it just wouldn't have been possible. 

Like many unlicensed Taiwanese Megadrive games, the game uses a lot of copied content from other games, among other things numerous graphics, or "inspriration", from Seiken Densetsu 3 and Romancing Saga 3 for the SNES. The sound engine is also assumingly stolen directly from Data East's High Seas Havoc, the biggest giveaway being that engines trademark organ sound. This same sound engine is actually used in quite a few other Taiwanese originals :) The game engine itself also is reused in other unlicensed titles. 

About the Patch:

This is a 100% translation from Chinese to English. The whole game has gone through a huge process to get where it is now, including in order:

-Disassembly and reassembly of the WHOLE game code  

-Insertion of 3 new fonts. One for dialogs and menus, a smaller one for  

items and magic, and a separate one for the intro text. 

-Completely working new VWF  

-Code modifications of the dialog, intro, shops, inns and battle text routines  

-Modified text windows  

-Modified Z80 code  

-Insertion of new title screen

    <desc>Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind is a Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo platform game released by Accolade in 1993. It is the first in the Bubsy the Bobcat series, and was released at the height of the "mascot wars" in which company mascots like Mario and Sonic were starring in popular video games. Bubsy was created by Michael Berlyn, and during production was hyped up to be "the next Sonic the Hedgehog" only to receive mixed reviews from critics. It did, however, spawn a number of sequels including Bubsy II, and a pilot was made for a cartoon series featuring the character.
In Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind there are fifteen levels in which Bubsy must defeat the evil Woolies who have stolen balls of yarn.</desc>

    <desc>Caliber.50 is a top-down run and gun video game originally released in arcades (as Cal.50) before being brought to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. The Mega Drive version was only released in North America.
The Mega Drive version is severely watered down from the arcade original, not just in terms of graphics and sound, but also gameplay, as the controls need to be mapped to three buttons.</desc>

Castlevania: Bloodlines, known as Vampire Killer in Japan, is an entry in the Castlevania series, and the first of two games to reach Sega systems. Bloodlines was the subject of much debate at the time, as even though it has a considerable amount of violence and many depictions of blood, Sega's Videogame Rating Council only gave the game a "GA", the lowest rating possible. This affected the European release, which was heavily censored and renamed Castlevania: The New Generation, and the Australian release kept the name while remaining identical to the American release in content. The game was released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive.

Bloodlines takes place in 1917 and does not feature the Belmont clan featured in previous games. It is also the first game not to take place exclusively within in Romania.</desc>

    <desc>Championship Pro-Am is a racing game developed by Rare Ltd. and published by Tradewest on the Sega Mega Drive. It is a remake of R.C. Pro-Am, a game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. R.C. Pro-Am was a popular title in its day and spawned sequels on the Nintendo Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System.

Graphics and music are somewhat improved. The letters that can be collected within a level spell out "CHAMPION", rather than "NINTENDO". Spelling out "CHAMPION" a third and fourth time will earn superchargers that increase speed from 104 MPH to 108 MPH and 110 MPH. Players enter their initials at the beginning of the game, not the end. There are five opponents instead of three. Cars under the effect of the roll cage power-up cannot be destroyed by missiles or bombs. Dash Zones earn 100 times the points as the Nintendo versions. There are lap records for each track and beating the record grants 500 points. Extra continues can be won every time five consecutive races are won.</desc>

    <desc>Chaos Engine 2 appeared in 1996 for AGA Amigas and 1 MB Amiga 500, with a rough beta version also in existence for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The game pits the player characters against each other as prisoners of Baron Fortesque, and is basically a competition game instead of a co-operation one. It was severely unfinished when released, due to the publisher rushing it out, and the game brought disappointment to many fans of the finely-honed first game. Little concrete information is found on the sequel, save for the page on the developers' website.

    <desc>Chase H.Q. II, known as Super H.Q. in Japan, is a sequel to Chase H.Q. and was developed and published by Taito for the Sega Mega Drive in 1992. It should not be confused with Special Criminal Investigation, which was also sometimes marked as "Chase H.Q. II".

Gameplay is very similar to the first game, with the major difference being a choice of three vehicles to chase criminals. By ramming the criminal's car enough times the car will be stopped and the criminal will be arrested. All of this needs to be done within a strict time limit, and while avoiding other cars and obstacles.</desc>

    <desc>Chiki Chiki Boys, also known as Mega Twins in some areas, is an arcade game by Capcom first released in 1990 and ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1992 by Sega and Visco. The game features two twins who are attempting to re-take control of their land, Alurea, after a monster unexpectedly attacks, destroying everything in its path. The people of Alurea have lived in peace for a thousand years and have forgotten how to fight, yet the land's only survivors, the twin sons of the king, must take up the challenge and return their kingdom to its former glory.

The two twins, aged around 15 at the time the game takes place, venture forth in search of a legendary stone known as "Dragon Blue Eyes," which is rumoured to be able to put everything back to rights.

The game is notable in the Sonic scene for its Mega Drive version; the Sonic 2 Simon Wai prototype contains some leftover graphics from the game once thought to be part of Sonic 2. The ROM is believed to have been dumped from a cart which originally had Chiki Chiki Boys before being overwritten with the Sonic 2 beta ROM.</desc>

    <desc>Chuck Rock is a platform game developed by Core Design and published by Virgin Interactive in 1991. It follows the adventure of a caveman named Chuck who must save Ophelia Rock from a tyrannosaurus rex called Garry Gritter.

The game was ported to a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Mega CD, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. The Mega CD version offers an enhanced soundtrack.

The sprite style and animation is cartoonish and gameplay filled with slapstick. Chuck can attack by thrusting his belly forward and hitting oncoming opponents. Another method of attack is by throwing rocks. Health is displayed in the HUD as a heart which shrinks with each hit taken. Health can be replenished by collecting dinsaur steaks found in levels. Some puzzle elements involve moving rocks to reach higher areas.

Chuck Rock was followed by Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck and BC Racers.</desc>

    <desc>ClayFighter, is a fighting game developed by Visual Concepts and published by Interplay in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. This game is a port from the Super Nintendo, with several gameplay changes taken from the updated SNES version, Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition. The game was most known for its colorful graphics, with each character rendered from clay to give the game its unique look.

The game features eight playable characters, battling each other to become the 'King of the Circus'. The one-player game has the selected character battle through several matches, including a few rematches against previously beaten opponents, before fighting the game's final enemy, N. Boss. Each character has a set of special moves performed with special button combinations. When a character receives heavy damage, the word 'KO!' will appear above them, if they are hit with a special move during this time, they will take extra damage.</desc>

    <desc>Columns III: Revenge of Columns, known as Columns III: Taiketsu! Columns World in Japan, is an entry in the Columns series of puzzle games developed by Sega in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive. It adds several new gameplay features, including new puzzle modes and up to five simultaneous players. The game was only released in Japan and the US, with VIC Tokai publishing it in the US (consequently, the incorrect myth that VIC Tokai also developed the game is very widespread). The game has been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service. Columns III most notably introduced the "Crush Bar," a competitive-play gambit which is now a staple feature of the Columns series appearing in every game since (each time with a different name).</desc>

    <desc>Columns is a puzzle game first created in 1989 by Jay Geertsen of Hewlett-Packard on the HP/UX with X Window System, with ports to DOS, Macintosh. Windows, and the Atari ST. In 1990, Geertsen sold the rights to Sega, where it was ported to the System C arcade board. This version was successful enough to be ported to various Sega and non-Sega hardware (including being both a Game Gear launch title and pack-in) and launched a series of sequels, that, despite bottomed-out popularity, continues to receive attention today.</desc>

    <desc>Comix Zone is a platform action game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Play involves defeating enemies with punches, kicks, and holds, managing your inventory, and solving puzzles.

The game's most remarkable feature is that it is set within the "panels" of a comic book. Each level consists of two "pages", and secrets are discovered by shredding the "paper" and revealing items. Dialogue is rendered within talk bubbles with the typical comic font. Sprites and backgrounds possess the bright colors and dynamic drawing style favored by superhero comics.

The plot concerns Sketch Turner, a cartoonist that during an unusual thunderstorm, becomes trapped in his own comic book while Mortus, the villain of his story, is flung out of it. Inside the comic book, he meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he's a superhero that came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil. In the real world, Mortus would literally draw new villains on the pages of the comic book, trying to kill Sketch Turner, and so obtaining his "real" body to conquer the real world with. Sketch Turner would have to battle his way through the pages, his only help being his pet rat Roadkill, who got electrocuted during this thunderstorm, enabling him to zap enemies.

The game is hidden within the Japanese version of Sonic Mega Collection and is locked part of all region versions of Sonic Mega Collection Plus, which is unlockable with having a Sonic Heroes gamesave, or is unlocked over time.

The original Genesis game came with a bonus music CD, which had vocal tracks of the 6 main tunes in the game. The music was performed by the band "Roadkill", which was lead by Howard Drossin.

Comix Zone was ported to the GBA and released in Europe in 2002.</desc>

    <desc>It's a hack, not a retranslation, although the script has been cleaned up. Lots of minor tweaks and things to make this my ideal version of the far superior USA release. There may even be some undocumented stuff I added&#x2026;

- Copyright screen edited slightly.
- Copyright screen can now be skipped by pressing the start button.
- Minor rewording in options menus.
- Maximum number of lives in options menu increased to 5 (default is still 3).
- Got rid of the annoying "press start to exit" feature in some menus.
- Start button can now be used to confirm some options.
- Start button can now be used to select your character.
- Mission briefings can now be skipped by pressing the start button.
- You can now hold buttons B &amp; C to skip through text faster.
- In-game font fixed such that lower-case characters are now usable.
- Added an alternate font (activated with a code).
- Added 'e accent aigu' for 'coup d'&#xE9;tat'.
- Script corrected, edited, and optimized.
- Soft reset added.

It is the only Contra installment on the Sega console aside from Contra: Legacy of War. The game is also notable for being one of the hardest games in the Contra franchise.

A parody of Simon Belmont, from the Castlevania series (also by Konami) is featured as an optional boss. He also has his respective theme, Simon1994RD, a remixed version of Vampire Killer.</desc>

    <desc>Cool Spot is a 1993 platform video game developed and published by Virgin Interactive staring the then mascot of 7-up, the 7-up spot. It is a sequel to Spot: The Video Game, a puzzle game similar to Ataxx initially released on the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Cool Spot was developed with the Sega Mega Drive in mind, and due to its success was ported to other platforms, including the Amiga, DOS computers, Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Sega Master System and SNES.

The PAL version of the game removes the 7-up branding on the bottle in the opening.

In some in-game text (particularly copyright info), the game is referred to as "Spot: The Quest For Cool".
The game is notable for making -no- use of Boss Battles, an otherwise expected gameplay feature.
The music in the game was composed by Tommy Tallarico, who also composed composed work for such titles as Earthworm Jim and Spider-Man and the X-Men: Arcade's Revenge.

The game was followed by the isometric platformer Spot Goes to Hollywood in 1995.</desc>

    <desc>Crack Down is a top-down arcade shoot-'em-up title developed by Sega for their Sega System 24 arcade board. It has subsequently been ported to a variety of systems, including the Sega Mega Drive, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS and ZX Spectrum. The Mega Drive version is a common choice for compilations, and has therefore seen several re-releases among other early Mega Drive titles. It has also been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service. For whatever reason, Sega had Sage's Creation publish the Mega Drive port in North America (it may have had to do with HOT-B making the port).

The game features two heroes, Ben and Andy, who have to get through a series of levels as quickly as possible by placing bombs on marked X spots scattered around the levels. The levels are heavily defended, but the player has an array of weaponry including a cannon, machine gun, and superbombs at their disposal in order to stay alive.

Crack Down is unusual in that its System 24 roots mean that the screen is always split into two. As a result, one of the main complaints for weaker systems (with lower screen resolutions) is that the majority of the screen is not used when playing a one-player game.

There is a known glitch in the Amiga version of the game which causes the final level to crash. Recent fan hacks have fixed the problem, but it was never addressed during the production run.</desc>

    <desc>Crusader of Centy in the US, Soleil in Europe, Shin Souseiki Ragnacenty in Japan, and Ragnacenty in Korea, is an adventure game developed by Nextech under contract from Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was translated to Korean (released 1995), English, French, German, and Spanish. The North American release was localized and published by Atlus. The game's music was composed by Motokazu Shinoda, a professional Japanese concert pianist and composer (sound programmer Noriyuki Iwadare is often miscredited as co-composer)

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters - though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be.</desc>

    <desc>Cyborg Justice is a 1993 beat-'em-up for the Sega Mega Drive by Novotrade.

A human astronaut crash-lands on a planet and almost dies, but is "rescued" by robots who take his brain, implant it into a cyborg's shell, and try to erase it so he can become their slave. But #127's brain erase function fails.</desc>

    <desc>One of two well-designed tennis sims from the Old World built around competition for the Davis Cup, one of the sport's top honors.

Now this is more like it! The graphics are a bit silly and the gameplay leans on the arcade side, but it plays smooth and has all the options most people would ever want. Easy to manage, too. It's not the best tennis sim out there, but it'll do for most folks.

Davis Cup World Tour Tennis 2 was never released, but a this playable beta is available.

    <desc>Decap Attack (also styled DEcapAttack) is a 1991 platforming game for the Sega Mega Drive by VIC Tokai. It is a hack of their 1990 game Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daibouken replacing everything except the basic gameplay and most of the engine (the sound driver was changed from SMPS to that used by composer Fumito Tamayama's company Graphic Research). You play as Chuck D. Head, a decapitated mummy who must defeat the forces of the evil Max D.Cap, an underworld warlord who is invading the world of the living.

Gameplay is identical to that of Magical Hat.</desc>

    <desc>Dick Tracy is a 1990 action game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System tying into the 1990 Dick Tracy film.

The game is an action game where Dick Tracy walks around killing bad guys to solve mysteries. The game exists in a pesudo-3D world where enemies either approach from where Dick is or from a distance "behind" him - therefore, Dick has to attack in two different ways. Due to the differences in the two consoles's controllers, controls for each version are slightly different. In order to make this explanation simple, we will use the first level, which takes place on a street with Dick walking along one sidewalk and the other enemies across the street, to explain the different attacks.</desc>

    <desc>Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops is a basketball game with commentary from US sportscaster and former basketball coach Dick Vitale. It features numerous college basketball teams, and was developed and published by Time Warner Interactive in 1994.

The game is unusual in that it attempts to create a fully 3D experience on Sega Mega Drive hardware, something assumed impossible. Depending on who has the ball, the screen rotates to face behind the player, rather than having a side-on view like NBA Jam. Unfortunately due to console limitations, this means there are no backgrounds (minus the floor and hoops), the rotations are choppy and the framerate is lower than in most games.

Though likely intended for a US-only release, Dick Vitale's "Awesome Baby" College Hoops managed to find its way to Australia. Rather than design new box art, Time Warner simply decided to plaster stickers on the box relevant to Australia, creating some tacky results.</desc>

    <desc>Even though Lion King II was plagued by an invincibility bug, it has gained a certain popularity and is often sought out by people venturing into the pirate market. Which might have been a contributing factor in why another Lion King game found its way into existence. While acknowledging its predecessor by calling their creation Lion King 3, whoever created this game decided to forfeit the setting and feel of the other unlicensed, trying to be closer in spirit to the original game instead. Lion King 3 heavily borrows elements, sprites and animations not only from its two prequels, but most of the enemy sprites come from a completely different, unexpected source: Donkey Kong Country! While that one seems to be a surprise at first, these enemy types actually make the game feel closer to the original Lion King than to its successor. Some more enemy types, like the chameleons or the porcupines, also found their way back from game one.

Furthermore, the game utilizes remixed versions of the original soundtrack for its stages; a nice touch especially when hearing it for the first time around. However, these remixes are rather short and, being stuck in an infinite loop per level, can become pretty annoying after a while. Anyhow, all these revisions, as well as the overall feel of the game, give the impression that this third release was created by entirely different people.

The star that turned little Simba into big Simba has also been removed from this "sequel." Instead, you can select the lion of your choice at the very beginning and complete the game either as lion cub or as adult lion. There isn't any difference between those two other than the looks, though. Also, for some levels the character sprite of Simba Jr. has a strange purple tint to it, which makes it seem as though something went wrong during the porting and inclusion of the sprite. Interestingly enough, the character has the right color scheme during the intro.

Yet another staple that was missing in Lion King II but found its way back from the original are boss fights. Even though Lion King 3 consists only of five rather short levels as well, in levels two, four and five you are faced with a special foe. These three characters actually seem to be specifically created for the game, although their designs differ greatly from another. The level two boss, a bear, seems to have strangely contorted extremities and moves in a weird manner, seemingly floating through the air when attacking. The boss patterns are simplistic at best, which is at least counteracted by strong randomization. You can never count on whether a boss enters the screen at the same spot he left, which can make the battles rather confusing affairs. With a fair amount of patience, however, none of these fights turn out to be too hard.

The biggest change which distinguishes this Lion King from the other two is the inclusion of a ranged attack for the lions. After collecting certain icons strewn throughout the five stages, Simba can fire some sort of shockwave to attack enemies from across the screen by swatting the air. While it is rather odd to make it possible for a lion to basically shoot at enemies, it strangely fits into the game rather well. Besides, if one did readily swallow that the movie wanted us to believe that an ostrich would willingly let a lion cub ride on its back, I readily suspend my disbelief when it comes to a lion attacking scorpions with some sort of sonic boom. 

While not exactly a hard affair either, or even a long one (it also contains of only five levels) this game is a tad less entertaining than the second part. It just doesn't seem as fresh and lacks a certain originality compared to its predecessor. It also contains an auto-scrolling level itself, but while the one in Lion King II was rather colorful and with nice scrolling, in Lion King 3 this level turns into an ugly mess, urging you to make lots of blind jumps that more often than not end nowhere and result in the loss of a life  pretty irritating. Furthermore, compared to Lion king II, which only had one major bug (the life bar issue), Lion King 3 suffers from several minor issues. Pretty often you need to swing from a peg, but clipping and collision detecting issues make these swings and jumps very random and irritating. You'll find yourself falling past a peg one time, and clinging from an empty spot in mid-air instead... or falling to your death altogether.

Dropping through solid ground or enemies hanging in mid-air also happen quite often. It is still a nice platformer, though, and unlike its predecessor completing the game actually poses a challenge since you can lose all your lives in this one. The first three levels shouldn't pose much of a problem, but once you reach the auto-scrolling level 4 you're likely to run through your lives in no time.

A Pirate in Disney's clothing 

Now, do these games reach the entertainment value of the original licensed game? Of course not, but that wasn't to be expected. Keep in mind that while the original Lion King was created by professional studios with enormous financial backing and highly qualified programmers and artists, these Chinese hacks were usually created in a rush by rather young, inexperienced programmers that probably weren't all that familiar with the console to begin with. These games don't enjoy quality assurance or intensive playtesting, so unfortunately, they tend to be buggy. Just don't try to see them as legitimate sequels just because they use the Lion King likeness  in that regard they come off as abominations, and Disney certainly would never allow them to exist officially. But nevertheless, these two games, despite their flaws, are actually quite enjoyable.

The second one especially has some nice original touches to it, and with a lot of imagination the third actually has some sort of cheaply made knock-off sequel feel, like a direct-to-video half hour spin-off sequel of the original feature film. They may not exactly be diamonds in the rough... but sometimes, rhinestones can also be pretty.

    <desc>First of all, you should realize that this game has NOTHING to do with the movie's direct-to-video sequels! In fact, apart from directly ripping the main protagonists character sprites from The Lion King, this "sequel" has next-to nothing in common with the official game! That doesn't mean that it is without any entertainment value, however.

Lion King II opens up with a nice little sequence showing a grown lion and its cub running toward the player along the Great Wall of China. This little intro alone looks pretty nice, but also gives a first hint of the qualities and oddities that this game contains. While the sprite of the cub is directly taken from the fourth level of the original, the accompanying sprite of the grown up lion is completely new  and it doesn't look half bad! While certainly looking decent, especially for a pirate Genesis title, the whole scene however raises the first two questions. Number one: What is Simba doing in China? The level cards confirm that this is in fact supposed to be the Great Wall  what gives? And second: Who are these lions supposed to be? Are those Simba and his father, Mufasa? Or is it a grown-up Simba and a cub of his own? Pondering these questions while looking at the nicely-done title screen, however, will not in any kind prepare you for what the game entails. 

The game stretches over five levels, all distinctly set in China. While this makes for a rather short game, each level comes with its own surprises not generally expected from an unlicensed platformer. The first level, for example, contains a short trip on a tiny raft over a river  basically just a moving platform, but a nice touch nonetheless. Level four is a maze that urges you do find the correct path through several doors, which you can only pass once you've eliminated all the enemies in the room. The fifth and final level is actually auto-scrolling, urging you to avoid obstacles and adding a little extra pressure to the gameplay. All this is actually nicely done, and the diversity definitely raises the game's fun factor.

The gameplay itself is pretty different from the original. You start out as little Simba as you make your way through the levels. However, gone are the original's Lion Roar or the ability to roll. Also, better not try jumping on enemies, as each direct contact will now hurt you. So how does little Simba defend himself? Well, even though the programmers directly ripped the character sprite from the original game, they actually went and tinkered a bit with it, adding some new animations and giving little Simba the ability to slash at enemies. The rest of the game, however, completely detaches itself from its licensed predecessor enough that one might call this game Lion King in Name Only and it makes the Chinese setting, odd as it may be, only a side note in all the strangeness going on.

For example: The enemies Simba is confronted with are odd  the first level throws weird teddy bear-like creatures or green monkeys at you. And why does the fifth level feature floating propeller-platforms sporting a Swastika? Strangest of all? As you start out as a small lion cub, each time you pick up a Star, your character turns into the big Simba sprite! While such power ups aren't too uncommon (like Mario turning big each time he picks up a mushroom), it seems pretty out of place when this character is supposed to be the Lion King of Disney fame! Being hit once makes the character turn back into a lion cub. Apart from growing bigger and thus gaining a slightly bigger reach for swatting enemies, this feature doesn't affect the rest of the game at all. It's just weird.

Overall, it makes for a short, but nice little game. There is just one really big problem with it: It appears to be broken in a very strange way. I don't mean the fact that sometimes Simba might fall through solid ground or hang from invisible ledges  which is annoying, but doesn't happen too often. Whenever you're being hit by an enemy, though, the life bar doesn't register it. The game acts like you were hit, including throwing you into a short period of invincibility, but it doesn't matter. You're not completely invulnerable, however, since spikes hurt you as normal, but even then, though they deplete your energy and you die, you still don't get a life subtracted. This seems to be a common phenomenon in every version of the bootleg I've encountered so far, and the same bug has been confirmed by others who own it. It seems to be an oversight on the programmer's part.

The fact that you can't really die, combined with the shortness of the entire affair, makes for a very easy game that can be easily beaten to enjoy the fireworks afterwards.

The original Mega Drive version was only released in Europe and Brazil, as Nintendo had secured a deal with Disney to ensure no Donald Duck games were released on rival systems in North America. It was also the first game to be developed under the Disney Interactive label.

Donald in Maui Mallard would be tuned up significantly and brought to the SNES as Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow, with later ports to Windows PCs and the Game Boy. Interestingly these versions omit all references to Donald Duck, citing that the main character's name is "Maui Mallard".</desc>

    <desc>Double Dragon II: The Revenge is a action game developed and published by Technos in 1988 as a sequel to the original Double Dragon. Originally for the arcades, it was later ported to a variety of systems. PALSOFT ported the game to the Sega Mega Drive and released it exclusively in Japan in 1991. The port was fairly accurate in comparison to the NES version.

The Black Warriors shoot and kill Marian, whom was saved by Billy and Jimmy Lee from the same gang in the first Double Dragon, and now Billy and Jimmy fight to avenge her. Most of the enemies from the first game re-appear but with slightly redrawn sprites.

Similar to the first Double Dragon game, there are four levels available. This includes a heliport, a lumber storehouse, a wheat field, and the bosses lair. Willy returns as the next to final boss but is succeeded by a double of the main character(s). Depending on how many are playing at the time one or two doubles will appear.</desc>

    <desc>Double Dragon is a 1987 arcade beat-'em-up by Technos. It was ported to a variety of consoles; Accolade brought it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and Sega to the Sega Master System in 1988. Accolade's version was licensed by Sega, despite the ROM header saying otherwise.

The Mega Drive port is a straight port of the arcade with slight differences in graphics and sound. The enemies also easily mimic the players up and down movement, which can lead to some annoyance.

The Master System version has slightly different controls due to the controller only having two buttons. Some parts of the levels are designed differently and extended. The mohawk Abobo is missing in this version. Unlimited continues are available up until the final stage (although unlimited continues can be attained in the final stage through a cheat).</desc>

The game was also distributed in Portugal where it is simply called Dragon Ball Z. The distributor, Ecofilmes, would take Japanese copies of the game, replace the cover (but keep the manual and cart), and sell the game as is, promising a free converter cart as the Japanese cartridges cannot fit into European Mega Drives. When the French version came out, they switched to using that version instead.</desc>

Technosoft acquired a license to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Devil Crash MD and releasing it in Japan. They would then license it to Tengen for localization overseas; Tengen censored a few graphics deemed too Satanic for western audiences and released the final product as Dragon's Fury in the US and Europe (hence the page name) despite the TurboGrafx-16 version having been released internationally beforehand. While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.</desc>

    <desc>Dragon's Revenge is a pinball game developed and published by Tengen as a sequel to Dragon's Fury/Devil Crash MD. The game was released exclusively on the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. Despite it being marked as a sequel, its production did not involve either Naxat Soft or Compile, who were responsible for the development of Devil Crash and the rest of the "Crush" pinball series (and in fact, they had already made a sequel to Devil Crush by then, the Japan-exclusive SNES Jaki Crush released in 1992), nor did it involve Technosoft who had ported Devil Crash to the Mega Drive and licensed it out to Tengen for it to be published overseas.

The goal, gameplay, and controls are identical to Dragon's Fury; it is unknown whether or not there is a way to win the game. Pausing will immediately show the password.</desc>

    <desc>The game is based on the earlier Japanese puzzler Puyo Puyo. It was released to the North American and European markets in November 1993. Though not a commercial success initially, it became more popular with time. It was later also released in various compilations and other forms.

It was also released by Samsung in South Korea under the name Dong Gu Ri Te Chi Jak Jeon. For whatever reason, some number of cartridges (between only the first run and half of the entire production) was produced by taking a Puyo Puyo cart, sticking the Dong Gu Ri label on, and placing it in the Dong Gu Ri packaging and selling it as is - meaning that South Korean copies of the game will either contain the correct Korean version of Mean Bean Machine or will actually be Puyo Puyo.</desc>

In 1997, the game was ported over to the Sega Saturn by Lobotomy Software and published by Sega. Rather than running in the Build engine, the developer ported the game under their own 3D engine custom made for the Saturn labeled "SlaveDriver" which was also used for their other PC to console ports such as PowerSlave/Exhumed and Quake. The Saturn port also received an exclusive level named "Urea 51."

In 1998, Tec Toy released a Mega Drive remake in Brazil with substantially different gameplay mechanics, levels, and a simplified engine; refer to that page for details.</desc>

This game oozes quirky from every pore. That's certainly what I took from it after the credits had rolled. Dynamite Headdy is injected with that nonsensical asian flavour that defies description.

You play as Headdy, a puppet who has escaped from the clutches of Dark Demon, with a physique very much like Rayman and it is up to you to defeat him for woefully obvious reasons.

Gameplay revolves around shooting your head at things to climb around and beat up enemies with various powerups abound which grant your head different abilities.

A credit to the diversity of this game, a series of powerups are used in what amounts to a shoot 'em up series of levels. Also present is a basketball minigame where you bounce balls into the nets with your head.

Very tight controls, colourful, whacky presentation, and solid platforming make Dynamite Headdy among my favourite Genesis titles. Rock on.

Translation Description:

Dynamite Headdy was one of those great games that unfortunately went through a process known as "localization". Nearly all the dialogue was removed, and what little remained was changed. Furthermore, many of the graphics were modified and this already challenging game had its difficulty level pumped up significantly.

Now you can play the original version of one of Treasure's truly innovative games, in English.

    <desc>Dyno Blaze is a cancelled beat 'em up that was in development by Bonsai Entertainment for the Genesis / Mega Drive, Mega CD and 3DO in 1994 and it would have been published by Virgin. A playable prototype of the game was somehow leaked online in 2008, in which you can try a series of (almost empty) levels where to move your rollerblade-dinosaur to fight enemies with an hockey stick. The levels are incomplete and bugged but it's possible to go trought them waiting for a bit at the end of the area and pressing the jump button.

The original press release for the game:

Today, Virgin Interactive Entertainment and Bonsai Entertainment Corporation signed a multi-SKU development contract for DYNOBLAZE?, an original game for SEGA CD and SEGA GENESIS.

Bonsai Entertainment will develop the original game based upon designs previously developed. "It's a game about 'Teenage Mutant Ninga Dinosaurs', that play street hockey on the streets of New York", said Joseph Moses, President of Bonsai Entertainment. He added, "Teaming up with Virgin, already a key player in this industry, is a major step for Bonsai. We intend to make them very proud."

"DynoBlaze" is scheduled for Christmas 1995 release across multiple platforms.

A weird Dyno Blaze proto was seen at the Video Game History 2008 expo in Monza (Italy), organized by our friends at Games Collection. In the VGH2K8 proto you can just see a rolling demo of the game's menu (without any gameplay) and a strange graph for a medicine know as "Lotensin" by CibaGeneva pharmaceuticals. We dont have any clue about what this all means, so if you have a good explanation feel free to share it!

Thanks to Jean-Fran?ois Th?b? for the contribution!

    <desc>Earnest Evans is a 1991 platforming action game developed by Wolf Team for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD released in the US and Japan as exclusives for the respective consoles. It is the first in the trilogy followed by El Viento and Anetto Futatabi - however it was released after El Viento, so this may actually be a port.

Earnest Evans III is on a quest to complete his grandfather's mission of saving the Earth from destruction by hiding three ancient idols with that power from evil hands, in Earnest Evans III's case the bounty hunter Brady Tresidder. Along the way, you meet Annet Myer, your companion through the wilderness, and Sigfried, who knows a lot about the history of the idols.</desc>

    <desc>Earthworm Jim 2 is the direct sequel to Earthworm Jim, released on the Sega Mega Drive, Super Nintendo and DOS computers in 1995. Enhanced versions were released on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and more recently the game has been released on the Game Boy Advance, Windows PC (through Steam and Good Old Games) and the Wii's Virtual Console service.

Though very similar to the original game, Earthworm Jim 2 has more varied gameplay than its predecessor. As well as including standard platforming levels, there are also quiz questions, an isometric shoot 'em up level and various adaptions to the platforming formula, including marathon races and a stage where Jim must shoot his way through mounds of dirt. It retains the surreal humour from the first game and was followed by Earthworm Jim 3D in 1999.</desc>

    <desc>Earthworm Jim is a platform video game developed by Shiny Entertainment in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. Highly praised at the time of release, Earthworm Jim offers very detailed and smooth graphics, a very well received soundtrack and large amounts of surreal humour and parodies of popular culture.

Earthworm Jim takes place over 7 main levels (8 in the Mega CD version), plus 7 bonus segments between levels, a boss you can avoid if you're good enough and a hidden bonus level halfway through the game.

Earthworm Jim was quickly ported to a variety of systems including the Sega Game Gear, Super Nintendo and Game Boy. It was released for the Sega Master System in 1996 exclusively in Brazil by Sega's distributor Tec Toy. Enhanced versions of the game including a CD audio soundtrack were released for the Sega Mega CD and Windows PCs, and in more recent times ports have been made to the Game Boy Advance, iPhone, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and the Wii's Virtual Console service.

The game was followed by Earthworm Jim 2 and a variety of other sequels. It also led to a cartoon show by Universal Animation Studios, which is arguably one of the more successful video game cartoon adaptions of all time.</desc>

    <desc>Ecco the Dolphin (sometimes known simply as Ecco) is a successful video game developed by Novotrade International and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System (only in Europe), Sega Game Gear and later Sega Mega CD. It is one of the Mega Drive's most well-known titles, and spawned numerous sequels. The game features a bottlenosed dolphin named Ecco on a sidescrolling underwater adventure. The game is noted for its high difficulty level, and though appears to appeal to a younger audience, has a much deeper and darker story than anticipated. Ecco on the Mega CD features a full redbook audio soundtrack composed by Spencer Nilsen and has re-designed levels.

Ecco was has been re-released in several formats over the years, usually in its original Mega Drive form. It was included in Sega Mega Drive Collection for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Sony PlayStation Portable, and was released as a downloadable title through the RealOne Arcade service (also in the form of a one hour trial version). In 2006 it was released on the Wii's Virtual Console service, and in 2007 became a downloadable title through the Xbox Live Arcade service. Ecco was also included in Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection. It was also ported to the PC in 1996.

Ecco the Dolphin was followed by Ecco: The Tides of Time.</desc>

    <desc>Ecco Jr. is an spin-off of the Ecco the Dolphin series, aimed at younger children. It was released in 1995 for the Sega Mega Drive, though a similar Sega Pico title named Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt! was also made available.

Ecco the Dolphin had been a huge success for Sega and Novotrade, but both it and its sequel are often regarded as very challenging and often confusing video games meaning they are unsuitable for the young market. Despite this, Ecco was bought with young children in mind, which prompted the creation of Ecco Jr. which would attempt to appeal to a younger audience with the extreme difficulty removed. Unlike other games in the series, it is impossible for Ecco (or his friends) to die, and the focus is placed on completing simple tasks and on educational material about dolphins.

Despite the lack of gameplay value for older gamers, Ecco Jr. has been re-released as part of the PlayStation 2/PlayStation Portable title Sega Mega Drive Collection and Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection. It was also released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>ESWAT: City Under Siege is a Sega Mega Drive action game released for the console in 1990. It is a reimagining fo the 1989 arcade game ESWAT: Cyber Police, though aside from minor similarites, it is an entirely different game. It is often confused with ESWAT: Cyber Police, not least because the Japanese version of this release calls the game Cyber Police ESWAT.

ESWAT: Cyber Police was brought to many home systems around the same period as ESWAT: City Under Siege, adding further confusion to the naming scheme. The Sega Master System version of ESWAT: Cyber Police calls itself ESWAT: City Under Siege on its title screen, but is again, unrelated to this Mega Drive game.

The Mega Drive version is the most common of the two ESWAT games, having been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service and included in numerous recent Mega Drive compilations.</desc>

In Career Mode, you can create your own boxer with several predefined appearance settings and stats (which are mutual - changing one will change the others appropriately). In Exhibition Mode, you can only choose from various professional boxers.

The graphics and match engine would be reused in the 1994 game Greatest Heavyweights.</desc>

    <desc>Exile, called Exile: Toki no Hazama he in Japan, is a 1991 RPG by Telenet Japan released on the Sega Mega Drive. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT called "XZR" in Japan; where this false name came from is unknown. Furthermore, the game may not have originated on the Mega Drive, it may have been ported to other platforms, and it may also actually be a sequel to an earlier game (which may have been called XZR). The exact situation with this game is unknown (or at least not known in English).

Over the course of human history, one country managed to conquer the world through war - only to be destroyed by the desert warrior Sadler. Peace did not last long: Sadler waged a brutal war with Luciel, a rival tribe.</desc>

    <desc>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.

Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US - therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).</desc>

    <desc>F-22 Interceptor: Advanced Tactical Fighter is a flight simulation shoot-'em-up game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive. It has the player pilot a fictional F-22 jet fighter, blowing up airebourne enemies and ground targets. The game was released in 1991, a full fourteen years before the F-22 Raptor came into service.

The game is widely criticised for its slugglish controls and lag, partly because F-22 Interceptor tries to render 3D polygons in certain locations. It is notable for having multiple camera perspectives, however - something not seen in many video games of the time.</desc>

Initially released in arcades, the game was ported to a variety of home platforms including the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. The Mega Drive port was handled by Takara (but published by Sega), and, like the SNES version, is said to be inferior to the Neo Geo original.

In Fatal Fury, the user can select one of three characters - brothers Terry Bogard and Andy Bogard or Joe, who must defeat Geese Howard.</desc>

    <desc>Fatal Labyrinth, called Shi no Meikyuu: Labyrinth of Death in Japan, is a role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. In Japan, it was a Sega Game Toshokan download exclusive. In the game you play as Trykaar, who must enter Dragonia, the castle of doom and traverse its thirty levels to retrieve the Holy Goblet.

The game is a roguelike where most levels of the castle are chosen at random from a predefined set. You will find monsters and items scattered at random.

The game ends when you run out of health. You regain health by eating food found as items on the ground; health will slowly regenerate while you have health left to regenerate. If you run out of food, you will rapidly lose health until you eat food or die. If you eat too much food (the "F" counter on the HUD exceeds 80), you will slow down. Eat more (F=99) and you die.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA International Soccer (known as FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition for its Sega Mega CD release), is the first game in the long-running FIFA series, developed by Extended Play Productions and published by Electronic Arts.

As well as being released for the Sega Mega CD, it was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System, as well as several non-Sega consoles and computers. Most ports were released in 1993, though the Mega CD version and some Japanese ports were delayed until 1994 (and in some cases, even 1995). The Master System version was exclusive to Brazil, and is a port of the Game Gear version.

Unlike later FIFA games which are presented in full 3D, FIFA International Soccer goes for an isometric perspective and has much simpler gameplay. Also, though it allows the user to play as official international teams, it does not feature official player names. Nevertheless, the combination of isometric graphics and a commentator set it aside from its rivals, namely the Sensible Soccer and Kick Off series.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA Soccer 95 is a football game developed by Extended Play Productions published by Electronic Arts. It is the second licensed FIFA video game, following FIFA International Soccer and was the first to start the annual naming trend which continues to this day.

FIFA 95 was only released on the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear, under the motto "The best console soccer can get!". It was the first soccer game to feature licensed clubs from several different international leagues, like the Major League (USA), Premier League (UK) and the Bundesliga (Germany).
The game was also famous for its music, made by Jeff Dyck. The sound driver is very advanced and uses two PCM channels using software mixing and variable sample frequency.

It also offers a four-player mode using Electronic Arts' "4-Way-Play" device.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA Soccer '96 is an entry to the FIFA series of video games, and was developed by Extended Play Productions and published by Electronic Arts. Though it was not the first FIFA game (both FIFA Soccer '95 and FIFA International Soccer had come before it), FIFA 96 is often considered the first truly successful FIFA game, and opened the doors to annual sequels that continue to this day. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega 32X , Sega Saturn, Sega Game Gear, DOS, PlayStation, SNES, and Game Boy.

Though not all versions could handle all the new features FIFA 96 brought to the table, the game was revolutionary for having a running commentary provided by John Motson, and it was the first 3D entry to the series.</desc>

    <desc>
Flashback, known in the US as Flashback: The Quest for Identity, is a platform-action game for the Commodore Amiga developed by Delphine Software and published by U.S. Gold in 1992. Arguably Delphine Software's greatest work, it has been ported to a variety of platforms, including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD, as well as 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Atari Jaguar, CD-i, DOS, FM Towns, iPhone OS, Mac OS, NEC PC-9801, and SNES. CD-based versions tend to include full motion video cutscenes and an enhanced music soundtrack, but are essentially the same game.

In Flashback the player controls Conrad B. Hart, who having escaped from aliens finds himself in the jungles of Titan with his memory erased. He must recover his memory and save earth from an alien attack. The game is largely inspired by Prince of Persia, though has many notable improvements such as a weapon system. The game was well received due to its fluid animations and stealth-like gameplay.
The Sega versions of the game have one notable difference than other versions - Conrad wears a white shirt, presumably due to a more limited on-screen color palette.

The game was followed by a 3D title, Fade to Black, a PlayStation 1 exclusive. Plans for a second sequel called Flashback Legends was due for the Game Boy Advance, but was cancelled. Leaked prototypes show a significant amount of graphical and story changes that barely resemble the world built up in the previous titles. As Delphine Software no longer exist, the chances of a true sequel are slim.</desc>

    <desc>F1, known as Formula One on North American packaging is a formula one racing game developed by Lankhor/Teque London and published by Domark. It should not be confused with the later game, F1 World Championship Edition, also published by Domark. F1 was released in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear.

No versions of this game were released in Japan, while the Game Gear version was exclusive to North America.

F1 is notable because unlike earlier attempts at Formula One such as Super Monaco GP, it is able to simulate changes in height. This meant at the time it was one of the most realistic racers around.</desc>

Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball is a 1995 baseball game for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear, Sega Saturn, SNES, and other consoles by Iguana Entertainment and Acclaim.

When pitching, you choose the type of pitch you want to make from a series of lists. If the ball has been hit, you have full control over the rest of the team to try to knock the other guy out; in this case, all the buttons will throw the ball to the nearest player facing you. When swinging, you can only move horizontally across the batting area and have only one type of swing.</desc>

    <desc>Frogger is a video game originally developed by Konami running on Namco's Galaxian hardware and released in arcades in 1981. Frogger was a massive success in arcades and has been ported to numerous platforms as well as spawning numerous sequels and remakes (and unofficial clones).

Distribution and publishing rights to Frogger were held by Sega in the early 1980s, which were then sold on to other companies for home use (for example, Parker Brothers had the ROM cartridge rights and Sierra On-Line held the magnetic media rights). Often this would lead to some video game consoles and computers receiving multiple ports of Frogger. Sega distributed three diffeerent arcade versions of Frogger, one of which ran on the modified version of the Galaxian hardware used by Nichibutsu's Moon Cresta.

Frogger bypassed Sega's consoles and computers during the 1980s, but eventually saw a North American release on the Sega Mega Drive in 1998 by Majesco (who had at this point been given the rights to distribute Sega's older consoles in this region). It was the last Sega Mega Drive game to be released in North America (and was a North American exclusive). Coincidentally Frogger was also the last SNES game to be released in that region. Both copies of the game recycle box art from Frogger 3D, a three-dimensional sequel released a year earlier.

Unfortunately the Mega Drive port is merely a straight arcade port, with no enhanced graphics or sound, bar a new title screen.

Plans for a Sega Game Gear version of Frogger were put in place, but were ultimately scrapped. It is rumoured that licensing issues caused this, though a working protoype of the game has since been found.</desc>

    <desc>Fun 'n' Games is a 1993 game for the Sega Mega Drive by Leland Interactive Media and Tradewest. When Tradewest brought the game to Europe for Sony Electronic Publishing to publish the following year, Leland and Tradewest gave it a new logo, box art, main menu, presentation, and name Fun 'n Games (though the back of the box still says Fun 'n' Games), which would then be used for the SNES and 3DO ports, released later in 1994 (the last after Williams bought Leland and Tradewest).

There are four game modes. The original American release presented these in the form of objects in a "Fun 'n' Games Clubhouse"; all other releases use a simple text menu.</desc>

In the year 3000, humans have polluted Earth to such an extent that Gulfer, a group of space pirates, plan to use the pollution to fuel weapons of mass destruction. The United Star Cluster of Leezaluth feel the only way to stop this from happening is to blow the Sun up, but allows the humans one chance to save themselves: by sending Dan Dare (Diaz in Japan) in a special ship to stop Gulfer. Aiding Dan in a special sub-ship is the TOZ System, run by Leezaluth emissary Alexis, which can steal powers from the space pirates's own ships. Should you succeed, Leezaluth will give the humans a new planet to inhabit.</desc>

    <desc>Galaxy Force II is a 1988 arcade game developed by Sega AM2. It is a sequel to Galaxy Force, though the differences between the two games minimal. It is a third person on-the-rails shoot 'em up, where the player controls a spaceship traveling across various planets destroying enemies. Like all Sega Y Board games, it is heavily reliant on sprite scaling and rotations.

Besides a change in title screen, the exact differences between Galaxy Force and Galaxy Force II are not yet known. Galaxy Force II, however, was housed in much simpler, "traditional" arcade cabinets unlike its prequel.

Galaxy Force II was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1989, and a selection of computers including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the inferior hardware of these systems, large cutbacks were made regarding detail and the reception has hence been mixed. There was a more respectable port to the FM Towns Marty in Japan however, which kept the sprite scaling, and there was a re-release for the Sega Saturn under the Sega Ages label. Many of the computer releases mis-label the packaging as "Galaxy Force" rather than "Galaxy Force II", but the in-game title screens retain the numbering. A port to NEC's SuperGrafx was also in development and shown in magazines, but never completed.

The arcade game has since been re-released in Japan as part of the PlayStation 2's Sega Ages 2500 series. More recently, the Mega Drive version of the game was brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>Garfield: Caught in the Act is a platformer game starring the characters from the Garfield comic series. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1995, and was brought to Windows in 1996 as a stand-alone title as well as through the Sonic &amp; Garfield Pack. A port to the Sega 32X under the title of Garfield in TV Land was planned, but scrapped, though the name was still used in some later re-releases. The original Mega Drive game features six levels. Sega Channel subscribers could download Garfield: The Lost Levels, that featured 3 different levels.

The Game Gear version includes eight levels, two of which appear in the Lost Levels. There is only one type of bonus stage (accessed by finding an icon of Arlene's face in each level), in which you try to wreck everything in Jon's living room within a time limit to get an extra life. Garfield does not have different outfits in each level, and the attacks are the same in all levels (his close-range is a punch, and the projectile are stones). There are no invincibility items. In the between-level segments, you do not take damage from the obstacles; instead, they teleport you back to the start of that segment.

In the PC, there is a new level, Alien Landscape, and the Mega Drive levels are arranged in a different order.</desc>

    <desc>Gargoyles is an action game for the Sega Mega Drive made in 1995 by Buena Vista Interactive made to tie in with the Gargoyles television series created by Buena Vista for Disney (though the Disney name is nowhere to be found on the actual game).

The game uses the MC68000's tas (test and set) opcode to do condition-related things (exactly what is unknown; TODO). tas runs in a different way from other CPUs, and for some unknown reason the Genesis is wired differently. The designers of the Genesis 3 overlooked this, and for some unknown reason, the game will not run on this model, making it the only game not to run on the Genesis 3 due to something other than additional hardware not being supported.</desc>

    <desc>Royal Blood is a 1991 strategy game by Koei for various Japanese computers from its "Imagination Series." It has been ported to many other systems and its international releases renamed Gemfire in those regions. A port to the Sega Mega Drive was released in the US and Japan in 1992.

Ishmeria is an island inhabited by humans and mythical creatures guarded by six magicians. A Fire Dragon challenged them, and the battle that ensued resulted in a curse being set on magic itself: whoever wears the Crown of Seven Jewels has full control of the island's magic. That person is King Eselred, whose tyranny led his daughter Robyn to take the jewels from the crown, which hold the magic power, and scatter them around. Now, the six wizards, each united with six noble families of Ishmeria, and Eselred, united with the Fire Dragon, must race to get the jewels first - should they fall back into Eselred's hands, all hope for the Ishmeria's freedom will be lost.

There are several scenarios to play. In each, you control one of the six noble families, each in control of a country on the island. The game is played by taking control of the country as it fights neighboring countries, develops its own land, and makes diplomatic agreements toward the goal.</desc>

    <desc>Ghouls'n Ghosts, called Daimakaimura in Japan, is an arcade platformer developed by Capcom and is the sequel to Ghost'n Goblins. It first appeared in December 1988, and was subsequently ported to the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sharp X68000, SuperGrafx and ZX Spectrum. It follows the knight Arthur who must restore souls stolen by the evil Lucifer (including that of his lover, Princess Prin Prin).

Though it is considered a classic, Ghouls'n Ghosts is notoriously difficult thanks to the constant waves of enemies and traps despite Arthur only having a couple of hit points.

For a while, the Sega Mega Drive version (released in 1989 and ported and published by Sega) was considered the most accurate home port of the game, and was a selling point for the Mega Drive console. This version has since been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>G-LOC: Air Battle (G-LOC meaning "G-force induced Loss Of Consciousness") is an air combat simulator developed by Sega AM2. It is a spiritual sequel to After Burner II, featuring similar gameplay ideas and some recycled sound effects, though has always been publically advertised as a different game entirely. Unlike games using the After Burner name, G-LOC uses a first person perspective, though it does occasionally pan out to a third person view when the player's plane is locked onto by an enemy.
Like After Burner, the goal is to eliminate enemy planes, though in G-LOC there are also ground units. The original arcade version runs on more advanced Sega Y Board hardware, and makes heavy use of sprite scaling/rotation and pre-rendered 3D graphics.

G-LOC is notable for being one of the first video games to offer an arcade cabinet which could rotate 360 degrees on all three axes, immersing the player in the action. These versions of the game are sometimes referred to as G-LOC R360, though the gameplay itself is identical.

Though not as popular in arcades as After Burner, G-LOC was still ported to a variety of home platforms, including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. Computer ports, often going by the name G-LOC R360 were released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. All these versions suffer from various cutbacks due to weaker hardware, though some versions add extra features such as boss battles.

G-LOC was followed by Strike Fighter, which is extremely similar in design but ditches the time-based missions in favour of gameplay more akin to After Burner.</desc>

    <desc>Gods is a 1991 platformer by The Bitmap Brothers, originally released for the Commodore Amiga and later ported to a variety of home consoles and computers, including a 1992 port to the Sega Mega Drive. This version was the first game published by Accolade after acquiring an official license after winning Sega v. Accolade (though they still presumably continued to press unlicensed games).

"Four guardians" have broken the citadel used to protect the city of the gods, and have asked any warrior to retake the citadel in return for a favor. You play as one such warrior, who asks to become a god himself, equal to the others.</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe III is a Sega Mega Drive exclusive sequel to Golden Axe II. Its original Mega Drive release never showed up in the west, only being available in Japan, Asia and South Korea. It has since been brought to the Wii's Virtual Console service and has been made available for more regions of the world.

The game is similar to previous entries in the series, but includes new characters, an expanded moveset and forks within levels where you can choose which path to take.

By changing RAM values while the game is running, it is possible to play as any standard enemy within the game (though many will cause the game to crash when their special move is activated, or will have glitched graphics/collision values when played).</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe II is the direct sequel to the critically acclaimed Golden Axe. Unlike its prequel, however, Golden Axe II is a Sega Mega Drive exclusive (though it has since been re-released as part of numerous Mega Drive compilations). It was initially released in 1991.

Like its predecessor, Golden Axe II is a beat-em-up game starring Ax-Battler, Tyris-Flare and Gilius Thunderhead. Replacing Death Adder as the antagonist is a new being named "Dark Guld".

Golden Axe II has received mixed reviews from critics. Many claim the game is merely a re-hash of the previous entry in the series, as very little is added to the core gameplay. Though some have praised the graphics and music, others have criticised the game's poor sound effects which are said to ruin the atmosphere of the game. Luckily, many of these concerns were addressed in the sequel, Golden Axe III.</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe is a beat-'em-up developed by Sega and released in 1989 for Sega System 16 arcade hardware. The development team was headded by Makoto Uchida, who also led the team behind Altered Beast.

The game was the first in the long-running Golden Axe series. It is said to be heavily inspired by the Conan the Barbarian films, and that the game took roughly one year to make.

The game has enjoyed many years of success on the Sega Mega Drive, and was used in the early days of the console to advertise the system's power over its then-main rival, the Nintendo Entertainment System. Some levels were shortened, but an extra level was added which includes another boss, "Doom Bringer". Also in this version is a "duel" mode, which allows players to fight a succession of enemies one-on-one.

The Mega Drive version of the game has been included in numerous compilations, such as 6-Pak, Mega Games 2, Mega Games 6 and Mega Games 10. The game has also been emulated and sold in the form of Sega Smash Pack Volume 1, Sega PC Smash Pack, Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection, Sega Archives from USA Vol. 1 and Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection Volume 1, as well as services such as PlaySega and built-in to numerous consoles by AtGames.

This version was so popular that it got direct sequels in the form of Golden Axe II and Golden Axe III. In the arcades, the "true" sequel is Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder. A Sega Mega-Tech version also exists, which is based on the Mega Drive version, as is the version released for the Wii's Virtual Console service.

The Mega Drive Golden Axe was enhanced for the Sega Mega CD and delivered as part of Sega Classics Arcade Collection. This version is single-player only, though offers numerous improvements in terms of audio and some graphical tweaks.</desc>

    <desc>Granada is a 1990 shoot-'em-up by Wolf Team released in the US and Japan for the Sega Mega Drive and in Japan for the X68000. "Granada" is a mobile tank-like weapon whose origin is uncertain. In September 2016, Leon Todo, a private mercenary, accepts a task from an enterprise agent that takes him to Japan, where he finds Granada and uses it to complete said task.

The player is situated in a large field full of enemies, obstacles, and enemy generators that may be freely moved upon (unlike most conventional shoot-'em-ups). The goal of each level is to destroy each enemy generator (red dots on the HUD in the bottom right corner) and then a boss all before the timer runs out.</desc>

    <desc>Hard Drivin' is a 1988 arcade driving game developed by Atari Games and later ported to numerous consoles and computers including the Sega Mega Drive. The aim is to race around a course as fast as possible without crashing.

Hard Drivin' is notable for its use of 3D polygon graphics, which was considered too processor-intensive to be plausible on the systems of the day. Though less impressive than the Commodore 64 or Amstrad CPC versions, Hard Drivin' on the Mega Drive still stands out as being one of the few games on the console to attempt 3D.

One of Hard Drivin''s sequels, Race Drivin' also made it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1992.</desc>

    <desc>Harry Potter for the Sega Mega Drive is an unlicensed release loosely based around the Harry Potter novels (and films). The title screen actually reads Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen, as the artwork is borrowed from German promotional material for the first film. It was developed by "KuKuzz" for emurussia forums in 2004, though has since made its way onto the black market and sold as a retail product.

The game is very similar to Pac-Man (or Pac-Mania), and has Harry travel across isometric mazes with themese slightly similar to those found in the books. He has to collect a certain amount of flying golden snitches, while avoiding a handful of other characters, many of which have no relation to the series whatsoever. The game steals music from the film as well as Street Fighter II and Puzzle Bobble.</desc>

Hellfire does not follow the typical powerup system of most shmups of the time. Instead, your ship, the CNCS1, can fire either straight to the right (pink), straight to the left (yellow), straight up and down (green), or diagonally in four directions (blue).</desc>

    <desc>Insector X is a side-scrolling shooter developed by Taito for the arcades in 1989 and ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990, with HOT-B publishing it in Japan and Sage's Creation publishing it in the US. It is the only Mega Drive game Taito developed but not published themselves (in fact the port may have actually been made by HOT-B but this requires confirmation).

The game has the insect-like main character, Kai, going through a number of nature-based and cave environments. The player can collect a variety of powerups and weapon upgrades to defeat oncoming enemies and bosses.

The plot is fairly simplistic and ultimately involves defeating the dark ruler queen, freeing the insect world from her power.</desc>

    <desc>For a young, unseasoned video game developer, nothing quite beats the grand satisfaction of seeing his or her first commercial project through to the end. After many long, hard days and nights of coding, testing and debugging, the light at the end of the tunnel finally approaches, and the pride and expectation of wanting to view the final product on a store shelf is nearly overwhelming. Unfortunately for some, despite having thrown their heart and soul into the work and endured all the stress along the way, that wondrous day of release... never comes. Instead, their heart sinks as they are shuffled off to another project.

Such was the story for Matt Harmon, the lead designer and programmer of the Sega Genesis action game, It Came From The Desert. An eager young hacker turned professional developer, Matt was put in charge of the entire project and worked feverishly to complete it in good time. However, despite getting the game to a near completed state, he was told that it was over; the game had been shelved indefinitely by the publisher.

While the prototype version of It Came From The Desert is legally available for free download directly from Cinemaware's website, it's certainly not the style of release Matt had originally hoped for, nor the only one this game deserved. However, while the chances for neglected title's commercial release may have died many years ago, its story will be immortalized. 

The whole interview with Matt Harmon can be read here:

This game was released right in the middle of the lawsuit between Sega and Accolade. As such, initial US copies of the game were distributed without a license from Sega. After the lawsuit was dropped, US packaging would include a Sega Seal of Quality, but in the form of an added sticker. EU versions, released slightly later, would be distributed in redesigned packaging, complete with official Sega branding.</desc>

    <desc>James Pond II: Codename RoboCod (also known as Super James Pond or Super James Pond II) is a platforming sequel to James Pond. It was released on a variety of platforms, including the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 (and the only Mega Drive entry in the series released in Japan) and the Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System in 1993. The game has numerous parodies to the film RoboCop, including a similar theme song.

Gameplay differs heavily from the original. This game is a conventional platformer, with James Pond moving on land and jumping without the aid or need for water. There are no missions; instead, Pond must find an exit sign in each level (accessible through doors into a building in the overworld).</desc>

    <desc>James Pond 3: Operation Starfish (sometimes spelt James Pond 3: Operation Starfi5h, in reference to the in-game F.I.5.H. secret service), is the third game in the James Pond series and is a direct sequel to James Pond II: Codename RoboCod. The working title for the game was James Pond 3: Splash Gordon, a pun on Flash Gordon.

Like its predecessor, the game is a platformer, this time set in space. The gameplay seems to be inspired by both Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario World.

Initially programmed for the Commodore Amiga, it was ported to the Amiga CD32, SNES, Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear.</desc>

    <desc>James Pond: Underwater Agent is first in a series of games developed by Millennium Interactive. It was first released on the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in 1990, and was ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Acorn Archimedes in 1991. In the game, the player controls a fish named Pond, who needs to complete a series of rescue missions and stop the evil Doctor Maybe from polluting the world's oceans. Unlike later games in the series, James Pond is not a traditional platform game, as most of the game takes place underwater (similar to Ecco the Dolphin).</desc>

    <desc>Jelly Boy was one of those "lost" Platformers of the SNES-era. By this, I mean it was a game of exceptional quality that got lost within the many, many poorly designed 2D Platformers that plagued that console generation. Subsequently this game, like Plok or Skyblazer or any decent non-Mario-affiliated platformer, went largely unnoticed by the general gaming public on release.

Jelly Boy puts in the control of a jelly baby with morphing powers, sort of like if A Boy and His Blob merged together in some ungodly ritual. His quest is to find various items inside a weird factory so that the elevator doorman will allow him to go up and meet the dude in charge. Awesome music, polished graphics, a whole bunch of detailed levels and worlds and a bizarre sense of humor brighten up an otherwise generic platformer.

    <desc>Jeopardy!: Deluxe Edition is a 1993 game by Park Place Productions and GameTek based on the Jeopardy! television game show. Unlike GameTek's other Jeopardy! games, this one only appeared on two platforms: the Sega Mega Drive and the SNES.

The game itself looks, sounds, and plays exactly like the regular Jeopardy! Mega Drive game (to the point that "Deluxe Edition" does not appear anywhere except the ROM header; this is not the case in the SNES version, where the "Deluxe Edition" is shown in-game).</desc>

The Mega Drive version supports up to three human players and looks like the original show (during the game's release), however the Game Gear version is rather stripped down, with only two contestants in a game, no CPU-vs.-CPU play, and poorer quality graphics.

Both games received updates in Jeopardy!: Sports Edition and the Mega Drive version received one in Jeopardy!: Deluxe Edition.</desc>

    <desc>Jim Power: The Arcade Game is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive platform game developed by Loriciel.

Despite its name, there was not an arcade release of Jim Power - it is in fact a re-tooled version of a 1993 SNES/DOS game, Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3D, which itself can be seen as a re-imagining of the earlier Jim Power In Mutant Planet for home computers. The Arcade Game is essentially the same game as Lost Dimension in 3D, however replaces the 3D/Mode 7 effects with 2D shoot-'em-up stages. There have also been numerous tweaks to make the game easier, as Jim Power games are notoriously difficult.

The game was cancelled due to Loriciel having financial troubles, however a prototype has since surfaced on the internet showing that Jim Power: The Arcade Game was very close to completion. There is only one music track in the game, which was intended for stage 3, however all the levels can be played and the game can be beaten.</desc>

    <desc>All the stars of the NFLPA are here - Aikman, Cunningham, Young, Elway, Irvin, Seau, Swilling and many more! Sensational new "Behind the QB" view gives you a total of six different perspectives. Improved passing game and new SPEED BURSTS combine for offensive fireworks. Great features include audibles, screen passes, 360-degree spins, diving catches, team playbooks, instant replays and more! Full 16 game '93 season, playoffs, and Super Bowl. Battery backup allows you to keep team standings plus track league leaders in passing, rushing, sacks, etc.

Gameplay:

After SEGA picked up the license and changed names with last year's edition, they ultimately decided to drop 'Sports Talk' for the simpler title "NFL Football". With over 800 players based on the 1992 season, all of the series trademarks including play-by-play commentary, authentic playbooks and instant replays are intact. Battery backup support is available for season play. This release features significant camera adjustments including a lower perspective and some enhanced zooming features which bring mixed reactions.

    <desc>Joe Montana II Sports Talk Football is the sequel to Joe Montana Football, released by Sega in 1991 exclusively on the Sega Mega Drive.

It has Joe Montana return as announcer, except this time, his announcements occur continuously in real time in accordance with the action, much as a real American football game would be, as opposed to the previous method of only having voice samples after plays (or in the case of other sports, hits, goals, etc.). The Sports Talk theme would follow in other Sega games, such as Sports Talk Baseball and this game's sequel, NFL Sports Talk Football '93 Starring Joe Montana, and would quickly become standard in both Sega's own games and everyone else's.</desc>

    <desc>Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba S.R, threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control, sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge of his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his Nuclear Weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious druglord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs.

Because of this threat, you're hired again to battle these two characters, following their paths in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Commache, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, you must take out their private army. Blow up the enemy with your hellfires, hydras, chain guns. Use the watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships. Pull off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side. Take out the evil duo and forever rid this threat.....in the jungle!

    <desc>The game situates itself on the "Isla Sorna" sites of Jurassic Park, a concept originally based on the Steven Spielberg series of movies. You play the role of a bounty hunter trying to catch some prized dinosaurs. This game is not a side scrolling platform game like the other two Jurassic Park games on the Genesis. This is a top-down view game like the SNES version of Jurassic Park, with gameplay similar to The Chaos Engine.

Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three missions. Once you have completed the three missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get two more final missions to complete the game.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Rampage Edition is faster, tougher and more dangerous than ever! Take up arms as Dr. Grant to blast through all-new action-packed levels or be a razor-clawed Raptor as you dodge the slashing jaws of the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! Man or beast, the goal is the same... escape the island alive before it blows!

Directions:

Grant - Collect dinosaur samples.

Raptor - GO AROUND RAISING HAVOC AND CHAOS! 

Gameplay:

Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition is the sequel to the first Jurassic Park game on Genesis and mostly looks and plays like the predecessor. It is also a side-scroller.

In this game you play as Dr. Grant. The big difference with the first game is that there are more enemies to defeat. In addition to the dinosaurs you have to defeat many InGen agents. The reason is that they are trying to recapture dinosaur DNA and eggs to build a new park or an army of dinosaurs.

Controls:

A Button: Switch weapons(Grant), Bite(Raptor)
B Button: Attack
C Button: Jump

Hints:

- T. Rex -
Don't try to kill T. Rex, it's impossible. Instead just slow him down enough to keep him from getting you.

    <desc>Darkseid attacks the planet Earth, destroying a military base in the process. A member of the Justice League (that the player chooses to play as) tracks down the other members for information and aid only be to attacked by those heroes in their related locations.

As the hero defeats the other JL members, they deduce that the others aren't the real leaguers. Coming to this conclusion, the hero battles Cheetah and then Despero for more information.

They both lead the hero to Darkseid, who then forces the hero to fight their android clone. Upon defeating the clone, the hero must face Darkseid himself.

After the hero defeats him, the other League members are freed, and the military base is restored.

    <desc>Kei is an incredibly powerful Japanese boxer. One day the Boss of the evil Kageki gang sees him in action. Impressed by Kei's pugilistic skills, the Boss asks him to be his right hand man in his organization. Kei, honorable guy that he is, boldly refuses. The Boss swears that he will not be spurned. A few days later, Kei's brother is beaten within an inch of his life. Knowing who is behind this brutal assault, Kei vows revenge.

Gameplay:

As Kei you must fight nine Kageki gang members and four underlings in a series of one-on-one fights before confronting the Boss himself. Your opponents vary in skill and abilities. For example: Ashpit is slow but can slap really hard, and Lizard is a dirty fighter who attacks using sandbags. As a boxer, your offensive moves are limited to a jab (left punch), a super jab (right punch), and a straight (right punch). You can also duck and jump. The action takes place in a garage, a gym, a machine room, a former night club, a fitness club, and other locations inside a high-rise building. Unlike most fighting games, Kageki is designed for only one player.

Controls:

Start: Pause
D-Pad: Move character in all directions
A Button: Jump
B Button: Jab, super jab
C Button: Straight punch
B &amp; C simultaneously: Duck

    <desc>Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.

The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.

Directions:

The object is to grab first place in order to grab top honors at the end.

Trivia:

The sequel, Kawasaki Caribbean Challenge, was apparently not released for the Genesis/Mega Drive. This entry uses the Domark F1 game engine.

    <desc>The third entry in the Kick Off series is the first that offers a isometric view instead of the old top-down view. In the game there are four competitions (World Cup Finals, League, Knock Out Cup and the challenge). There is several options for game speed and ball control to suit both novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has "key players", such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.

    <desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free. You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.

This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.

It was released in the US as Fatal Rewind This is the Japanese version released in 1993 with remixed baddies/level changes &amp; a nice intro missing from the US version.

The story of "King Colossus" is simple: you are a young fighter who lives in a small house somewhere on a fantasy continent and who was raised by the local wise man. Now, when he became skilled at sword fighting, the wise man sends him to the dangerous South Cave, to defeat the monsters populating it. By visiting different places, the hero will battle even more fearsome monsters, until he finally challenges the ultimate evil.

"King Colossus" is a top-down adventure with action combat and light RPG elements. You fight monsters by equipping weapons and swinging them in real time. There is a variety of accessories and items to find in the game, as well as different obstacles to overcome in the dungeons.

Translation Description:

A 100% complete English Genesis translation by our friends at MIJET. It works on a real Genesis and should have no known issues. They took this project very seriously and I expect you'll find this to be a top quality translation.

    <desc>For this game, there are three cameos from Street Fighter included (Ryu, Guile and Cammy). Also, like in some pirated fighting games, most of the character names are randomly screwed up. For example, Terry is known as "Treey" and Cammy as "Canme".

Another two things of this game is that each character seems to have a lot of health which is why it takes longer for the fight to end, and that there is a Game Over screen I haven't seen before.

Trivia:

Theme song is straight from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

    <desc>Alien super monsters have returned and are trying to invade Earth again! Now, Super Geon, Atomic Guy, and Cyber Woo must fight to retain control of the planet. Each one has special attacks and powers. Take on monsters that have unique abilities never seen before, including fire breath, aerial spins, and radioactive blasts. Challenge a friend, or have him help you out in the two-player option. Battle your way through seven levels of intense action in KING OF THE MONSTERS 2.

Gameplay:

The sequel to King of the Monsters, King of the Monsters 2 features more monsters, more levels, and a new type of character, the minor fighter aliens, who pester you as you do battle. As in the first game, you control a monster and you fight other monsters one at a time using methods from various wrestling and fighting games. The colorful variety of monsters includes Super Geon, a Godzilla look-alike; Atomic Guy, an armor-plated scientist; Cyber Woo, a super robot built for war; Huge Frogger, a reptilian alien; Eifflelyte, a fierce mutant warrior; Claw Head, a crabby fusion of an assortment of creatures; Beetle Master, a super insectoid; Aqua Slug, a slimy sea creature; and Lavicus, a levitating alien maker. While fighting monsters, you'll also have to ward off heavily armed humans who are trying to regain control of the Earth. They come at you in submarines, tanks, and fighter planes. As you work your way through the game, you'll fight in exotic locations such as the Grand Canyon, Tokyo, the desert, and France. A two-player mode allows you and a friend to each pick a monster and go at it head-to-head. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.

    <desc>Sometime in the future, the world devolves into a place where monsters rule supreme. After years of wreaking having on Earth, these so-called Super Monsters ask the existential question, "Which among us is the most powerful?" After years of fighting, four rise to prominence. 

Gameplay:

They are the superhero Astro Guy, whose Power Weapon is a Flash Wave; Godzilla-like Geon, who is deadly with a Flame Crusher; stone-faced Rockey, who crushes opponents with his Rockey Bomber; and slimy mutant Beetlemania, who attacks his foes with a Beetle Missile. To play this game, you choose one of these four monsters, using him to fight the rest of the monsters one at a time. 

In the two-player mode, you and a friend each choose a monster and fight each other. The two of you can also choose a favorite level: Megaport, Castle City, Dragon City, or Tokyo. Each level consists of two stages. While fighting a monster, you should be on the lookout for tanks, jets, battleships, and laser vehicles that will attack you from all sides. To defeat your opponent, you must weaken him and pin him down for a count of three.

    <desc>Maximus was a good king. His subjects were happy, businesses were successful, food was tasty, and all seemed right. Since he ruled over four continents with only his wise judgment and Scepter of Order, this was a considerable achievement. Little did the King know, however, that an evil creature named Arech Dragonbreath planned on stealing the scepter to throw the world into chaos.

One night while Maximus slept, Arech teleported inside the Royal Chambers and pulled the Scepter of Order from the King's grip. He then ordered his followers to attack the continents and take as much land as they desired. Meanwhile, Maximus grew seriously ill. It seems the Scepter's return will not only restore the kingdom to its former glory, but also save the King's life.

Arech shattered the magical instrument into 25 pieces, giving sixteen to evil nobles, one for himself, and scattering the remaining eight across the continents. This is where you come in. You'll need to save the dying king and four continents by retrieving all 25 parts of the Scepter of Order. Depending on the difficulty level you select, you'll either have 200, 400, 600 or 900 days to accomplish this.

The four characters you'll choose from include Sir Crimsaun the Knight, Lord Palmer the Paladin, Tynnestra the Sorceress, and Mad Moham the Barbarian. During your quest you'll be able to amass armies (depending on your character's leadership skills), siege castles, obtain contracts, fight turn-based battles and manage your weekly commission. Passwords will allow players to continue their game at any time.

    <desc>Klax is a straightforward puzzle game developed by the Tengen who licensed it from the Atari Games Corporation. Most remember it because of its edgy catch phrase, "It is the Nineties and there is time for Klax."

Basically, you have to clear the blocks while the fall which is called a Klax when you line up three of the same color vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The main difference from most puzzle games is that you can see more than one of them as they fall end over end down a slope.</desc>

    <desc>Lakers vs. Celtics is a basketball game featuring real NBA teams. Gameplay is action-oriented with an emphasis on offense. Play an exhibition game or try to win the NBA title in the playoff tournament mode. A season mode is not available. You can substitute tired players but there aren't any other management options.

The DOS version has ten '88-'89 NBA teams, including the East and West All-Stars. You can play with some of the biggest names in NBA history including Kareem, Bird, Jordan and Ewing. Several star players have their own signature move. 

The Genesis version, which was released one year later, has ten NBA teams from the '89-'90 season. It also adds more signature moves, different home- and away-jerseys, player portraits for the starting five, voice-samples for the referee and counts the number of personal fouls a players has committed.

Trivia:

- The Genesis version, which was released one year after the DOS version, isn't a port of the DOS version. It's almost a completely new game: it has new animations, sounds, graphics and adds player portraits. Moreover the DOS version has 10 1988-1989 teams while the rosters in the Genesis version are based on the 1989-1990 NBA season.

- '88-'89 was Kareem Abdul Jabbar's last season so unfortunately he and his famous skyhook move are left out of the Genesis version.

- While both versions are called Lakers vs. Celtics, it was actually the Detroit Pistons who won the NBA title in '88-'89 as well as '89-'90.

- This game is one of very few to have Michael Jordan playable in the Bulls' roster due to his expensive contract rights.

    <name>Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Landstalker is an action packed adventure, where you play Nigel, the Elf. You must search for the treasures of King Nole, and face many uncharted areas in your search for riches. Grab your sword and your booty bag, it's off to the island of Mercator to find the treasure. 

The legends of King Nole are known through out the land. Hundreds of years ago, the evil King swept across the continent, amassing hoardes of riches. Many treasure hunters have tried to find the large cache of jewels and other riches, but none have found anything. Returning to the city of Kalva with his latest find, Nigel is exuberant that it sold as well as it did. Planning to live on the coast for a while, he was taken by surprise when a tiny girl with wings and a forked tail sails into his backpack. She says she knows where the treasures are hidden, and is anxious to take you there.

Gameplay:

The player, as Nigel the treasure hunter, is tasked with searching for clues that lead to the treasure of King Nole. This is accomplished primarily by travelling through both outdoor areas and dungeons. All gameplay takes place in an isometric view, including plot-advancing scenes.

From the outset of the game, Nigel may walk, jump, swing his sword, talk to various non-player characters, and pick up and throw various objects. With very few exceptions, these basic actions do not change throughout the game, although Nigel's weapons and armor may be replaced with better versions thereof. There are a variety of items throughout the game, most of which are either restorative in nature or important to advancing the plot or solving puzzles.

The game's dungeons are filled with monsters, puzzles, and traps that require the player to jump from platform to platform. Locked doors inhibit the player's progress, and keys must be found to unlock them. The player has health which is kept track of by hearts; health and the maximum health limit may be increased with items purchased in towns or found in dungeons. The player is not prevented from revisiting old towns and dungeons, and is frequently required to do so to advance the plot.

Trivia:

- There was a scene cut out where Kayla is taking a bath. Nigel can either join or trying leave her, but in the end he will be beaten by Friday or Kaylas Henchmen.
- "Madam Yards Studio" (brothel) was renamed to "Ballet Studio" for NA and European territories.
- The Ending differs slightly from the American and European/Japanese ones. The original ending is that one where all the treasures are gone.
- In 2005, it was announced that Landstalker will be remade for the PlayStation Portable, but the release date was canceled. This game was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on September 3, 2007, and in Europe on October 5, 2007.

This game is what could be called a Shining Force clone, except that the series has been going on for a long time, spanning various consoles, and it's quite fun. It's also heavily story-driven, but unfortunately, I can't make up much of it because it's in Japanese.

It looks like Shining Force, it plays like Shining Force, but it's much deeper, since you control whole armies using a similar interface. It can get rather tedious, but if you have patience, you can master it.

Translation Description:

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive game Langrisser II. It is the sequel to Langrisser (known as Warsong in the USA) by Masaya. As usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it is capable of displaying the original Japanese script in addition to the English translation, depending on the country code of your machine.

It is loosely based on the older Hiryuu Honyaku / Warui Toransu translation. A few improvements to their original work were made by D et al. before he passed it off to M.I.J.E.T. Aside from the script and a few graphics, almost nothing was taken from the old release. The hacking was completely redone from scratch and is far superior. The script was almost entirely rewritten, edited, and type-set, with quite a bit of it retranslated. If you shied away from the older release, you may find that this version meets your standards.

    <desc>Danny Madigan is watching a sneak preview of the latest film of his favourite hero, Jack Slater, when he is mysteriously catapulted inside the screen; now standing next to his favourite idol. You are Jack Slater, an action movie hero, who takes on the ax maniac "The Ripper", who is holding a school under siege, and Benedict, a villain who wants to use Danny's ticket to bring terror to the real world.

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.

    <desc>Last Battle, known as Hokuto no Ken: Shin Seikimatsu Kyuuseishu Densetsu in Japan, is an action game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. As the Japanese name suggests, it was originally intended to be paired with the Japanese manga series, Hokuto no Ken, but the graphics were altered for a western release. In fact, it is a sequel to Hokuto no Ken, which was given the same treatment and sold as Black Belt overseas. It was a launch title for the console in North America.

The game was ported to the Amiga and Commodore 64 by Elite Systems in 1991.

The Japanese version of the game has since been re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

    <desc>Galahad travels through this platform adventure game, slashing up mutant creatures with a sword and battling the evil Thanatos in hopes to save the life of Princess Lucanna.

The controls are very simple and easy to understand - jump, walk or attack. Collect icons that will help in the enhancement of your armor, gain an extra life and coins to spend in the shop for new weapons. Be sure not to collect any skull icons or else it will call Thanatos' Ethereal Presence where you will have to use Rune Bombs to destroy it. After you complete one of the 3 worlds, you will be given a password so you can resume later after running out of lives.

Gameplay:

Galahad collects coins throughout each level, with which he can purchase armour, potions and new swords in a shop which appears infrequently during the game. The ultimate aim of each level is to find a certain object named at the start of level (with instructions where to find it). When Galahad finds it, he must find a portal which will lead him on to the next level. If he does not find the object, he cannot enter the portal.
Enemies encountered during the game range from dragons and elves to snakes and giant otters. At the end of each world, Galahad faces a gargantuan boss, whom he must defeat to enter the next world. The first version of this title was called Leander and was written by for the Amiga by Traveller's Tales for Psygnosis.

The Lemmings are in trouble and only their ancient talisman and a huge amount of skills can save them in this long-awaited follow-up to the Lemmings Saga.

Meet the Highland Lemmings, Space Lemmings, Beach-Bum Lemmings, Circus Lemmings and many, many more on a quest to save their island...

--from the cover of Lemmings 2: The Tribes

Gameplay:

This sequel to the overwhelmingly popular Lemmings game actually includes a storyline to go along with the puzzles. It seems the Lemmings of Lemming Island are split into twelve unique tribes, each with their own distinctive look and variety of special skills. Due to a mysterious catastrophe, the tribes must get back together and reassemble the Lemming Talisman which was split among them.

Your task is to get as many of each tribe as possible to the center of Lemming Island by navigating through several puzzles. Use their unique skills to overcome obstacles and avoid traps, saving as many of the Lemmings Tribes as possible.

    <desc>What is a Lemming?

Lemmings are actually very small rodents that live in Northern Europe. Every so many years an unusual event happens: The Lemmings population explodes and grows to immense proportions. At this time, the multitudes travel across vast spaces of land oblivious to any danger that may confront them. The Lemmings' only concern is to migrate forward, each following the next. Where are they going you ask? In an almost hypnotic state, they plunge, by the thousands, mindlessly into the sea towards certain annihilation.

This is your chance to play a part in a natural phenomenon and possibly help solve a puzzle which has baffled researchers for years.

Our Definition

lem-ming ('lem-ing): adorable yet incredibly stupid furry creatures, lost in a maze of confusion. Known for walking off cliffs, wandering aimlessly into dangerous passageways and drowning by the thousands in small pools of water. Without your help, they have no chance for survival.

Let's Go!

Lemmings may be mindless but are luckily equipped with special skills that you must assign to them so that they can travel safely through many dangerous terrains. An experienced player will know precisely where and when to assign these skills to the token Lemmings who will build a safe path towards an exit and save the rest of their buddies. Your success is measured by the percentage you save.

It will take all your brain power to rescue as many Lemmings as possible from impending doom! As you see hordes of these cute little fellows march to their sad fate, a guilty conscience is not the only thing you will develop--it's sure to become an addictive obsession!

--from the Genesis Lemmings game manual

Gameplay:

This is a really good game. The game might seem easy, but it takes a lot of thinking in the later levels. I prefer this version over the one on the SNES because it is closer to the original PC version. The game's music has the "springy" noise found in almost every Genesis game, unlike the SNES version.

Directions:

What they're trying to say in the manual is that you have to get those little green-haired Lemmings through an obstacle course to the exit before time runs out. The "special skills" are Blocker, Builder, Climber, Floater, Bomber, Basher, Miner, and Digger. Make sure they don't drown, fall, get burned, sliced, or smashed, depending on what's in the level.

    <desc>Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters is a 1994 arcade game that takes place in the American Old West. The object in the game is to shoot outlaws in order to eradicate crime from a stereotypical Old West town. Like in the original Lethal Enforcers, lives can be lost by shooting innocent civilians. The game was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and Sega CD.

Gameplay:

Lethal Enforcers 2 has five stages: "The Bank Robbery," "The Stage-Holdup," "Saloon Showdown," "The Train Robbery," and "The Hide-Out." During each stage, the player must shoot the armed outlaws without harming any innocent townsfolk (unlike the "bystanders" in the original 1992 arcade game) or fellow lawmen. One shot is usually enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a boss that must be defeated in order to complete the stage. Like the enemy bosses in the 1992 arcade game, they often shoot projectiles at the player.

In the game, the player's gun (a six-shooter) can carry up to 6 bullets. To reload, the player must aim his or her lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. In case of the Sega console versions, if a controller is used, the player only needs to press a specific button to reload.

At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent townsperson or lawmen is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continuous play is available.

There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Posse, Deputy, Sheriff, Deputy Marshal and U.S. Marshal. When the game begins, the player's rank is Sheriff, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted. On the SEGA Genesis, your accuracy for each stage corresponds to the rank you are given. 60%-69% will earn you the rank of Deputy. From 70%-79% is Sheriff. 80%-89% is Deputy Marshal and 90% or above is U.S. Marshal.

Additional weaponry can be found throughout the game that will give the player better firepower: 50 calibre sharps, rifles, double rigs, shotguns, gatling guns, and cannons. The gatling guns and cannons can each be used only once but the other four weapons can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If a player is shot while he or she has one of those weapons, however, they lose any special guns they have collected and will return to the regular gun.

In the arcade version, a DIP switch allows users to set the game to "Arcade Mode" or "Street Mode." In Arcade Mode, one assignment follows directly after the other where, between each assignment, there is a target practice session where the goal is to try to shoot all the required targets to improve the player's accuracy. Street Mode gives the player a choice of which stage they would like to go to, including a target practice stage.

    <desc>Lethal Enforcers is a 1992 shooting game released for the arcades by Konami. It is best known for its revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, its digitized graphics, and the controversy over its content.

Home versions were released for the Super NES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD during the following year. The home versions makes use of a revolver-shaped light gun known as the Konami Justifier, which came packaged with the game. A standard controller can be also used in lieu of the light gun in these versions. A second-player Justifier light gun, pink in color, was available only by mail order from Konami, and is very hard to find today.

Lethal Enforcers was followed by Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters, followed by the much different (and fully computer-generated) Lethal Enforcers 3. The game is also featured alongside Lethal Enforcers II in the two-in-one compilation Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II, released for the PlayStation in 1997.

Gameplay:

The player takes control of a police officer named "Don Marshall", who has been assigned to stop a growing crime wave that puts the city's security in jeopardy.

Lethal Enforcers has five stages or 'assignments': 'The Bank Robbery', 'Chinatown Assault' ("Downtown Assault" in Super Nintendo), 'The Hijackers', 'The Drug Dealers' ("The Gunrunners" in Super Nintendo), and 'The Chemical Plant'. During each stage, the player must shoot the armed criminals without harming any innocent bystanders or fellow officers. The innocents often warn the player of their presence with a plea of "Don't Shoot!", "Help Me!" or "I don't wanna die." If the player does hit one of them, the computer will issue an admonishment, "What are you doing?!" with an incredulous, rebuking tone, and forcing a life loss, but no removal of any special weapons.

One shot is usually enough to kill most enemies, announcing their appearance with "You missed me!", "You can't shoot me!", "You can't kill me", and "Eat Lead!". At the end of each stage, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to complete the assignment. Bosses often shoot projectiles at the player.

The player's gun can carry up to 6 bullets. To reload, the player must aim their lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. In case of the console versions, if a controller is used, the player only needs to press a specific button to reload.

At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent person or officer is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continuous play is available.

There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Patrolman, Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain and Commander. When the game begins, the player's rank is Detective, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted.

Additional weapons can be found throughout the game that will gives better firepower: automatics, Magnum bullets, rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers and machine guns. The grenade launchers and machine guns can each be used only once, but the automatics, the Magnum bullets, the rifles and the shotguns can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If the player is shot while they have one of those weapons, however, they lose any special guns they have collected and will return to the regular gun.

    <desc>LHX: Attack Chopper is a helicopter simulation with a strong arcade focus. You can freely choose which missions to fly first, and which helicopter to fly in a given mission. There are a total of four helicopters: Apache, Blackhawk, Osprey and LHX. With this fine selection of death machines you will engage countless enemy targets in Libya, East Germany and Vietnam throughout the game.

Trivia:

As of the year 2000, LHX is still the ONLY flight-sim that simulates the V-22 Osprey.

    <desc>Liberty or Death is a turn-based strategy video game for DOS, Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis released by Koei in 1993. Liberty or Death is part of Koei's Historical Simulation Series.

Gameplay:

The player can choose to control any of six Commanders-in-Chief, three each on the American Continental Army or British Army sides, during the American Revolutionary War.

For either side, the general objective is to eliminate all enemy troops throughout the Colonies by defeating them in battle. The strategies used to accomplish this change are based on which side you have chosen to play: the American side needs to hold out against the British and slowly gather its strength, while the British need to fortify their existing positions and quickly move against the Americans.

The gameplay focuses mainly on the military aspects of the conflict, but relationships with civilian, and particularly political, entities are of vital importance as their approval determines the budget for military spending, and in the worst-case scenario, they can vote for your ouster as C-in-C. Very historically accurate, the game faithfully reproduces the strategic situation of the war as well as many historical figures in great detail.

This game is known among players for its thoroughly researched historical detail, great complexity, level of difficulty, and the immense amount of time it takes to complete one game (similar to the experience of other Koei games). One could easily spend upwards of 250 hours on one game and might still be defeated in the end. The user interface showed many improvements over previous Koei games, including mouse support. The game can be played in one-player mode, two-player mode, or with two computer-generated players.

    <desc>This unreleased brawler by Ocean, settled up in the DC Comics' LOBO universe, actually reached end of development at Ocean of America. It was to be released for both the Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES in 1996, but the game was cancelled as a last minute decission and never saw the light of day for any platform.

    <desc>The Lost Vikings is a platform-puzzle game developed by Silicon &amp; Synapse (now Blizzard Entertainment) and published by Interplay for a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive.

The game follows three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, who have been plucked out of their own timezone by the evil Tomator, who is collecting lifeforms from all over the universe. It is up to the player to guide all three Vikings through various periods in time to get back to their ship. Each Viking has their own set of skills which are needed to progress through the stage. The player can only control one Viking at once, but can switch between them at any point and share items.

As the Sega Mega Drive version came slightly later than the others (1993 as opposed to 1992), it contains five stages not present in any other version. The music is also slightly different. The game is compatible with the 6-button gamepad and the Multi-tap, allowing for up to three players to play simultaneously.

The game was followed by The Lost Vikings 2: Norse by Norsewest which hit the Sega Saturn in 1997.</desc>

    <desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint. Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player

    <desc>Take the most powerful NATO tank, the M-1 Abrams, in 8 difficult missions against the Warsaw Pact forces. The four tank stations and the other aspects of the tank are quite nicely simulated, with different types of cannon rounds, coax machine guns, and all that. There's also the independent turret and track rotation commands. 

The controls are difficult at first But once you get that part down it gets pretty fun.

Directions:

You've got 3 different types of ammo, though I can't figure out how to switch between them &amp; There are separate controls for the tracks &amp; turret

Trivia:

This is the first game Dynamix tried (and applied) its proprietary 3D engine, which later caused so much excitement when used in Betrayal at Krondor.

Controls:

A Button: Fires the gun
B Button: Brings up the in-game menu
C Button: Hold to turn the turret independently
D-pad Left &amp; Right: Turn tank
D-pad Up and Down: Control the throttle

    <desc>John Madden Football, known as John Madden American Football in Europe, is an American football game developed by Park Place Productions and published by Electronic Arts. It is the second in the long line of Madden titles, which have been released annually since the creation of this game. The previous game, also called John Madden Football was released in 1988 and is largely unrelated to this one, aside from the similar themes.

John Madden Football for the Mega Drive can be seen as "Madden '91", being followed by John Madden Football '92, '93, '94 and so on. Every game has been named after John Madden, American football player, coach and commentator.

Electronic Arts reverse engineered the Sega Mega Drive in the hopes of selling the game in North America without having to pay royalties ($8-$10 USD per cartridge) to Sega. A proposal was then made to Sega that the fee be reduced to $2, with the overall fee not exceeding $2 million USD. Sega agreed due to fears EA would sell the information to other companies, and the process would reportedly save EA $35 million in the next three years.

John Madden Football was an enormous success for EA. Sega originally approached the company to sell it as Joe Montana Football, as their game was due to miss the 1990 Christmas shopping season, but were refused, instead being given a watered down engine for that game (which still proved successful). The first John Madden Football game is seen as an industry game changer - one of the first steps to take back market share from Nintendo in North America.

Elsewhere in the world, John Madden Football and its sequels have been less successful as the sport does not tend to resonate outside of the US, however EA has applied the annual release system to other sports titles, namely NHL, FIFA, PGA Tour Golf and NBA Live.</desc>

    <desc>Based on a popular manga comedy published in Shonen Jump, Magical Taruruuto-kun is about a boy named Edojou Honmaru who is constantly being bullied at school until he calls the titular hero Taruruuto from another world to help him. It is a cutesy platform game that plays similarly to most other games of its genre. There are many hazards to jump over and end of level boss fights, Taruruuto can hit enemies with his wand or pick up items and throw them.

    <desc>C&amp;E is a company you may have heard of before. It developed the RPG Beggar Prince, which was re-released by Super Fighter Team in 2006. For the NES, it made Mermaids of Atlantis, a game that was later licensed out and reworked into Bubble Bath Babes - a pornographic and ultr@ r@re unlicensed NES game. But, C&amp;E wanted a decent version of the game, so it made a 16-bit version itself. It was for the Sega Mega Drive of course, and the game was this time called Magic Bubble.

The story involves a mysterious nacre who creates magical bubbles of different colours. They can release oxygen to the creatures of the sea, but only if four of the same colour are grouped together. "The naughty bubbles" refuse to do that because an evil goddess controls them. However, YOU can use your control to prevent this and have the creatures of the sea get their precious oxygen.

If you have played any game from the Puyo Puyo or Columns franchises, then there should be no trouble for you to play Magic Bubble. Four bubbles of up to five different colours float upwards. Have four of the same colour link to each other, and they will disappear. What makes the gameplay much harder than, for example, Columns is that the bubbles don't continue to rise if there is space between them and other bubbles or the top. Instead, transparent bubbles take their place. They are hard to remove, but one solution is to sneak the regular bubbles inside them, when possible. The bubbles come in odd formations, making it challenging to flip them and putting them at the right spot. But that is mostly just part of the fun for me. Like in most of these kind of games, the game ends when the entrance for new bubbles is blocked.

There are three modes of play. In Type A, for every two hundred bubbles you pop the level changes, which means the bubbles will rise faster from now on. Occasionally, bubbles with the letters M, A, G, I and G come individually. When all of them are popped, you get a magic, which lets a nice fish pop all transparent bubbles for you. There might also come a shining bubble, and if you pop that one, you will reach a simple bonus level. After many levels, the game ends. In Type B, there is a shining bubble at the top. Your aim is to pop that bubble in order to beat the level. This type is a lot harder than the previous one, simply because there is no magic and you play against time. You might recognize it from other puzzle games. Type C is a versus mode, against the computer or your friend. Your play area here is smaller to fit both opponents.

After twenty bubbles popped, you get an attack. The attack moves your top two rows of bubbles to the field of the other player. The attack system doesn't work too well. It might lead to an attack war between the two players, so you have to be strategic when to use them. This mode consists of up to five rounds. I highly prefer the calm and easy gameplay of Type A, but Type C with a friend is a nice alternative if you've gotten tired of Puyo Puyo. All in all, I would say Magic Bubble suits well to pick up a rainy day where you want something only a little tricky for your mind.

C&amp;E put a lot of care into the design of this game. The fish and other creatures that roam around the screen when you play are not just made up by the designers. No, they exist in reality and look very well drawn and animated. C&amp;E even consulted an expert advisor for this. The rest of the graphical content isn't much to talk about. The bubbles look like you would expect them when you play, and that is just fine. There is also an introduction screen with some dancing bubbles which is mildly amusing.

I really like the music in Magic Bubble. It consists of soft, calm piano ballads that sound both happy and sad at the same time for some reason. There is a special feel to the music that fits perfectly for the aquatic theme. For an unlicensed game, the sound production is far better than for example the load of GEMS crap that plagued the console. There are some voice samples which are of average quality for the console in mind. For the sound effects, there isn't anything special. I just hate the "attack" sound in Type C, it is so irritating.

Magic Bubble is a nice little game. While it isn't too original, at least it has a very atmospheric audio-visual appearance that boosts the experience of it. There is not a lot of content, where the half-assed graphics take the biggest hit. But then again, what can you expect from a puzzle game? Three modes, four difficulty settings and two player option is well enough to grant this a purchase, especially when the game is fun to play. Unfortunately, it comes in a cardboard box which is quite ugly and might be in very bad shape if you manage to find the game. Even though it was completely in English, tracking it down in the western world is still very hard. Let's hope Super Fighter Team re-releases the game with the few enhancements it needs so everyone can get some bubble love!

    <desc>I've lost my marbles. Well, play this game and you'll never lose them again. This rolly polly puzzle game will have you playing for hours, just moving your marbles around on raised platforms, ramps, and tubes.

This game is the remake from the NES game Marble Madness. The interface was pretty much the same, although the graphics and music are much better in that there is more detail on the marble and the course, not to mention that the music is more grooving than the 8-bit sound from the NES game. This game is a fun way to spend hours just rolling around the puzzle course trying to get your marbles in the hole.

Directions:

Move your marble around with the directional pad to get it to the goal at the end of the course. However, due to the angle of the view the directions are front, back, left and right rather than up, down, left and right.

Or, if you switch the Control to Grid Mode, the directions are all set to diagonals, which just makes things confusing and difficult, so don't do that. The course is laid out with arrows that help direct you to the end.

If you fall off the edge or into a pit of spikes, your marble will die. Don't forget there are other things to worry about than just ramps and falls, you also have to worry about other marbles, jumping tubes, and other enemies trying to stop you. Don't die too many times or the game will be over.

Controls:

D-Pad: Guide marble through the course.
A, B, C: You don't need the buttons in this game.
Start Button: Pause

    <desc>Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most successful racing drivers in the US scene, and five of his relatives have also raced professionally. This game allows you to sample Indy cars, stock cars and sprint cars, all of which have been graced by Andrettis. The physics are customized to each of these, so expect sprint cars to slide around on the dirt tracks, and the slipstream effect is detectable.

There are 27 computer-controlled cars with individual profiles, and 8 cars to choose from in each race, with varying engine, grip, brakes and pit crew standards. You can view the action either from behind the car, or from the nose. In longer races you must monitor the pit strategy, with the options of a splash 'n' dash stop if your tires are still fine.

Check him out... Mario rips towards you. Check him into the glass. Nab the puck. Pass to an open winger for the give-&amp;-go. Then break free at mid-ice to connect. And slam home a 90mph slapshot. It's life-sized, gut-tightening action. He steals the puck, turns it up ice. You unload a body-crushing check. He drops his gloves... It's a fight! A jab. An uppercut. A roundhouse. And there's the whistle! Lose, and you chill out in the penalty box. Play on one of 16 fast and furious teams from Montreal to L.A. Pull from three sets of frontliners. Between periods, flip through 14 pages of hot stats. Major stuff. Major mayhem. After all, you're playing with Mario Lemieux!

    <desc>Colonel Brown, the evil owner of a toy factory, has created a substance that can turn people and animals into mutant sludge monsters. When Marko's football comes in touch with the substance it gets magical powers, giving Marko the power to stop Colonel Brown.

Now Marko has to find his way through numerous platform levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Using his magic football, he can perform various moves and attacks. He can kill his enemies with different kicks, header shots or even bicycle kicks and also use his ball as a trampoline. 

The SNES version features two additional moves for Marko (the ability to balance on the ball and a different method of returning it to him), but they do not have a great impact on gameplay.

    <desc>Based on the character developed by Belgian cartoon artist Franquin, this platform features the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange animal with a large tail, who was poached along with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends No?, Bip and Sarah tries to return to Palombia.

While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it includes a twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the Earthworm Jim levels where Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other enemies away, but also to change Bonelli's direction. The player also collects fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the player can't make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally available.

    <desc>In 1989, Namco released an arcade game called Marvel Land. The game featured beautiful graphics and platforming elements while you take the role of a dragon man, as he sets out on a journey to save the amusement park Marvel Land. Since arcade games were designed to eat as many of your coins as possible, Marvel Land has very high difficulty and longetivity, so it's unlikely someone will finish this game in one sitting (especially when in an arcade).

Trivia:

The European port was re-titled Talmit's Adventure.

    <desc>Based of the 1994 movie remake of Frankenstein, you play as the artificial man created by Victor Frankenstein. After Victor rejects you due to your hideous appearance, you flee from Victor and you swear your revenge on him.

You go through a number of levels battling anything that attacks you with your wooden stick. You can light the tip of the stick on fire if you swing it at fire which are always located a wall. You can use a special attack too on your attackers which The Creature holds up his hands and a blue ball comes out when you release the button. That takes some of your life away. You have to solve some simple puzzles in order to get through the level as well.

    <desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak.
Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.

Trivia:

Master of Monsters is in fact a fantasy spin-off of Systemsoft's more successful Daisenryaku series, with military units replaced by monsters and cities replaced by warlocks and towers.

Hints:

    <desc>Master of Weapon is a game released by Taito for arcades and for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It is a basic shoot 'em up game in which the player controls a space ship that has upgradeable weapons. These upgrades are collected by destroying green transport vessels which release the upgrade for the player to pick up.

Gameplay:

The spaceship starts with a basic photon cannon and air-to-ground bombs. Both of these weapons can fire continuously without a need for pause. The photon cannon can be upgraded five times for up to five streams of photons by collecting P upgrades. Additionally, the exhaust of the ship can be used as a weapon.

Special Weapons

Special weapons can be collected by picking up boxes with specific labels through destroying transport vessels.
P- Pier- Essentially the same as the conventional air-to-ground bomb. This is the default special weapon.
L- Laser- Very powerful but has a short range. It can attack both air and ground targets.
G- Guide- Shoots several green projectiles that track all targets on screen, self-destruct, and destroy the target.
W- Wide- a somewhat powerful launch of several projectiles in a star pattern.
H- H-Bomb- destroys all enemies on the screen for a few seconds. Can only be used once.
S- Increases the exhaust of the ship, allows it to damage enemies at a further range and increases movement speed of the ship.

    <desc>A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn maths while having fun.

The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).

Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.

The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.

The activities are as follows:
Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.

Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.

Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.

Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.
Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.

    <desc>The story takes place in 1999 where a Bio-Beast by the name of Godkaiser Hell has reigned supreme over Earth, after a nuclear and biological holocaust has disfigured most of the population and formed an army called the Steelmask Force. The survivors have fled underground and are constantly attacked by the Bio-Beast horde until one day a scientist by the name of Dr. Kabuto creates a mech, the Mazinger-Z, that can be used against the monsters. This is where the player takes control of the games protagonist and pilots the suit in an attempt to reclaim the Earth.

The gameplay is a hack-n-slash game, where the player controls the suit by using the D-pad and using the face buttons to slash at enemy monsters. There is also a Super Attack that the player can use, but it will decrease their health after each use. The enemies consist of mutant animals such as dogs and beetles as well as the Bio-Beast soldiers that can range from regular soldiers, female fighters and even ninjas.

There are five levels in all (Tokyo, Asia, Europe, New York and Egypt) divided into three stages with a mini-boss and a main boss the player must defeat to advance to the next level. There are also items scattered throughout the levels that will give the player extra points, health refills, an extra life and even a brief stint of invincibility.

Hints:

Fight the Bosses:
In the game option screen, highlight Sound test, select Sound 18. The choose Sound effect test option and select Sound 72. Exit out of the sound mode and press start. This trick will allow you to fight the bosses without fighting through the levels.

    <desc>This is the original Bomberman game for the Genesis. According to Eidolon, Factor 5 was asked to do a Genesis port of Bomberman and came up with this 8-player version that used multiple joystick port adaptors. Hudson was impressed, but decided in favor of licensing a local Japanese company instead.

Eight players on the Genesis is impressive enough, and the trademark frantic gameplay is still there! This game's a riot! Compared to this, Mega Bomberman seems rather stilted and awkward.

Trivia:

Also known as the Bomberman Eight Player Hack. I also note in passing that although it was never commercially released, this "ROM" demo is still covered by Hudson's copyright on the Bomberman franchise.

    <desc>BOOM! Here it is! This frantic arcade classic is a guaranteed blast. Bomb your way around scrolling mazes collecting power-ups in search of the magical locket. Or plug-in up to 4 Players to unleash a hugely addictive blast-a-thon of multiplay mayhem! 

--from the back cover of Mega Bomberman for Genesis

The game intro shows the Earth being broken into five pieces. The point of the game is to gain pieces of medallions by defeating all enemies in every world. When you collect all the pieces, you then fight a boss (by blowing him up, obviously). When you defeat him, that slice of the world will return to where it should be.

The graphics are fun and bright. This is much more fun to look at than the original Bomberman, though perhaps a bit more difficult to control. The music is more sophisticated than the original Bomberman as well, but I must say I loved that corny old music. Still, this music isn't bad.

Directions:

This Bomberman is very different from the original. You get harder baddies, kangaroos to ride on, bosses, and if you have any blocks left that could have been blown up at the end of the stage you get 15 seconds to go collect the coins they turn into (no worries, you don't have to make it back to the exit).

If it was a split level where you left one room and went into another but still had the same time limit, you won't be able to go back and get coins from blocks left in the other rooms. You can only collect coins in the room with the exit ramp. The coins are worth 500 points a piece.

In addition to the usual Bomberman goodies (power-ups that give you more bombs, bigger blasts, more speed, etc.) in this game you can find eggs. These strange, differently colored little kangaroos come out of the eggs, and you jump on their back. They allow you to do different things (being able to get hit once and only lose the 'roo instead of a life is the handiest). Press the B button while on your 'roo to see what it can do. Some kick bombs and some kick baddies, but that's not all they do.

As always, you can detonate your bombs remotely if, and only if, you have picked up the power-up that looks like a heart with a bomb in it.

Blow up the grey globes on pedestals to break the glass covering the piece of medallion. Run up the ramp and get it before time runs out. If you run out of time you will have to start the level over (unlike the original Bomberman in which red coins came out that were very hard to kill or avoid). Also unlike the original Bomberman, you can bomb the exit without consequences (no harder enemies will appear) and the only bad thing that happens when you bomb a power up is it vanishes.

Play with friends and blow each other up!

Controls:

A Button: Remote Detonate Bombs
B Button: Use Kangaroo Power
C Button: Place a Bomb
Start Button: Start Game/Pause

Hints:

Can't get out?
In the third stage of the very first world, you may find yourself stuck. The exit can be very difficult to spot. The exit is located in the top portion of the right arm of this cross-shaped stage. It's a slightly darker round area in the jungle around you. When you go through, there's more of Stage Three on the other side!

Final area
Put in the password 0515 to get to the Final Area.

This game is very special in the fact that it hosts the first three Mega Man games, and the fact that each game has new surprises throughout the levels. The graphics are far superior to those that are found on its NES counterparts, and the game play has taken a step up. The music has stayed the same as far as the classic Mega Man theme song goes, but it is a bit sharper thanks to the sixteen bit processor. Well, this is a true classic holding many enjoyable hours of game play within its small cartridge. So have fun with this remade classic, Mega Man: the Wily Wars.

    <desc>MegaPanel is a 1990 Puzzle game produced by Namco for the Sega Mega Drive. It was a Japanese only release.

Gameplay:

Overall at a quick glance Megapanel is similar to Tetris. The player must reconfigure coloured blocks that slowly scroll onto the screen, for them to be grouped in sets of the same colour, at which the blocks disappear and points are gained. However there are some major differences that gives the game credibility and separates itself out from been a "Tetris clone."

Instead of the blocks been made up of 3 or 4 squares arranged into various shapes, they are all the same shape, a simple square. Their only variable is the difference in colour. Much like some jigsaw puzzle games, there is one empty square on the screen, at which the player can slide the blocks around one at a time in attempt at getting them to be arranged into 3 colour long strings (vertically or horizontally). The blocks themselves also appear as 1 complete row from the bottom of the screen, rather than the top.

Like Tetris, the player attempts to keep the blocks from reaching the top of the screen before the various required goals are achieved. If that does happen, the player loses a life and has to start the level again. If the player loses all three lives then the game is over.

    <desc>A secret underground race on an island in the Atlantic ocean has stolen top military vehicles and equipment from around the world and have rebuilt powerful war machines from them. They are even piloted by robots with one mission: to destroy. Military and intelligence officials of major countries have detected them, but they are afraid that they will be unable to prepare against an assault by this underground race. Their plan is to send you in to infiltrate their base and destroy them before they have a chance to unleash the war upon the rest of the world.

You can choose to control either the Helicopter or the Jeep, which have different advantages -- for instance, the Helicopter is not stopped by obstacles but the Jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting specials) you can pick up along the way to help you destroy the enemy.

Trivia:

- The game was also released on the SNES as Super SWIV (Europe) and Firepower 2000 (USA), and on various home computer formats as SWIV.

- The music used for boss battles and the entire final level of the SNES version is lifted from a scene in the film "The Terminator" where Reese and a female fellow Tech-Com soldier engage an HK tank.

    <desc>Mega Turrican is a 16-bit shooter game, developed by Factor 5, and marketed in 1995 by Data East. This game of the Turrican series was initially designed for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and later followed by an Amiga port under the title of Turrican 3. However, despite not being the original, the Amiga version was the one that was first commercially released in 1993, published by Rainbow Arts in Germany and Renegade in Europe. The Mega Drive version didn't have a publisher and stayed unreleased until 1994, when Data East carried over its worldwide distribution. Data East itself released the game in North America, and contracted Sony Imagesoft for its distribution in Europe.

The Mega Drive version of the game was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on March 22, 2008 and on April 14, 2008 in North America.

After many generations of peace, the Dark Forces have assembled again, and as Bren McGuire, a member of the USS Freedom Forces, it is your job to defeat them once again. In the future, mankind will have to deal with many powerful alien species - not all of whom will choose to be friendly. That is the reason behind the Turrican suit - a one-man set of power armor that turns any Earth Force soldier into a nearly unstoppable killing machine.

Gameplay:

The player has to complete numerous large levels always searching for secrets to pick up and enemies to shoot. To do this, you can pick up three different, upgradeable shots: a "Multiple" spread gun, a more powerful, single-direction "Laser" and a "Rebound", which fires shots directly up and down that travel along floors and ceilings, while the main forward-firing shot is weaker. You can also go into wheel-mode by pressing jump whilst holding down on the D-Pad (as long as you have enough special energy) and use a rope. In wheel-mode, you are nearly invincible and can lay mines or explore previously unreachable areas, a mechanic similar to "Morph Ball" from the Metroid series and the "Spin Dash" from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

Development

The German magazine "Amiga Games" published a complete 6 part development diary (The long way from Turrican 2 to Turrican 3) in 1992.

Factor 5 began the work on Turrican 3 for the Amiga right after Turrican II was released in 1991. They had a working demo that already had some features from the final game. However, around this time, the Amiga market was already in decline and together with Rainbow Arts, it was decided to develop the game for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was completely redesigned for the console and it was co-developed by Factor 5 and members of Kaiko. Kaiko then approached Rainbow Arts and asked to develop their own version of Turrican 3 for the Amiga. However, development on this version did not get very far and was stopped after a short time. Development on the Amiga version was restarted, this time as a conversion of the Mega Drive game. The programming was done by Peter Thierolf, formerly of Kaiko (the company was falling apart at the time).

Turrican 3 for the Amiga was finally released in 1993, and even though Mega Turrican for the Mega Drive was finished earlier, its release had to be delayed due to the fact of Factor 5 not having a proper publisher for it. Data East finally published it in 1994.

The main differences between the versions are graphics (the 64 colours of the Mega Drive version had to be downconverted to 32 for the Amiga) and sound (the Amiga had the more advanced sound hardware and thus the music tracks sound more impressive on it). The main gameplay difference is that a secret level in Mega Turrican became a regular level in Turrican 3. In general terms, the game features much smaller levels to the original Amiga Turrican games and has much chunkier sprites, but compensates these with many new effects and graphical improvements, and a major focus on shooting action. The lightning whip from the first two games is gone and is replaced by a grappling hook.

    <desc>Terrorists have their job and you've got yours: CRUSH 'EM ALL! They've kidnapped a former President, and the MERCS are going in for the rescue. Punch through their coastal defenses, snatch enemy weapons and gain firepower. Pick up machine guns, bazookas and heavy artilery as you advance through the smoke of burning metal. Power up a flame thrower, and good-bye, Charlie! Push through a non-stop barrage of lead, grenades, heat seeking missiles and attack choppers. Hijack tanks and gunboats. Shred 'em with their own weapons! They messed with your country - now you're gonna make 'em scream!

Gameplay:

The Mega Drive port of Mercs featured two modes, an arcade mode, which mirrored the arcade release of the game, where the player had one "Merc" (soldier) who could pick up a variety of different weapons throughout the game; and an "original" mode, which included multiple playable characters, each with their own unique weapon. In both modes, the aim was to fight through the levels, defeating each boss at the end of every level.

Although the game is officially the sequel to Commando, the plot makes no connections to the first game. The forthcoming Bionic Commando sequel identifies the returning character of "Super Joe" (who was also the player's character in Commando) as Joseph Gibson, the Player 1 character from Mercs, essentially tying the two games together.

    <desc>Moonwalker is pretty much based on the Michael Jackson movie. Mr. Big has kidnapped the children and has nasty things in store for them, like drugging them and making them slaves. It's up to Michael to use his powers and save his little friends.

MJ can jump, throw magical stars and dance to counter his opponents as he looks for the hidden children. Stages come in shape of some of MJ's videos like streets and graveyards. There are also caves and a final showdown in space as a robot.

Hints:

- Level Select -
Hold Up/Left and A on controller 2. Press start at the title screen with the 1 player controller to start a one player game. The phrase round one will appear on the screen. Press left or right to change rounds and then press start to play.

- Play as a Robot -
In level 5-2, walk up the pair of steps where you first start off. walk to the right until you see the first opening &amp; closing drop .fall through and hold right to land on the surface under it. after that, open the door and rescue child. Then go all the way to the left where you first were but move to the right side of the box door. wait for the star to come and jump up to get it.

Note: This must be the first child rescued in this level.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Mickey Mouse gets a chance to go down memory lane and walk through the timeless adventures he has lived. Mickey Mania is a platformer where all the levels are based on Mickey's most famous cartoons. The levels range about 75 years, starting off with "Steamboat Willie" and going all the way to "The Prince and the Pauper".

Gameplay:

Like many other games of its genre, the player takes the role of Mickey and progresses through each level, defeating enemies in the way and solving the occasional puzzle. Most enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or throwing marbles at them. Frequently, the player must jump from platform to platform to advance, sometimes with a time limit (such as escaping a collapsing tower).

Trivia:

The four versions of the game differ greatly from each other. The Super NES version is missing the Band Concert level and the staircase sequence in the Mad Doctor level, as well as a few special effects and some of Pluto's appearances. It also adds loading screens between each area. In contrast, the Sega CD and Playstation versions add a sequence near the end of the Prince and the Pauper level where Mickey must find pencils to call the other Mickeys from the six main levels to attack Pete, as well as giving Mickey extensive dialogue relevant to situations throughout the game. The Playstation version, meanwhile, enhances the graphics and adds a sequence at the end of the Mickey and the Beanstalk level where Mickey must run away from Willie the Giant (Willie makes no appearance in any of the other versions despite being mentioned in the manuals of all four versions).

    <desc>Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse is a platform game developed by Sega AM7 for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. It was the first in a series of Disney games exclusive to Sega consoles.

Castle of Illusion was one of Sega's first big exclusives, and was promoted heavily to sell consoles before the release of Sonic the Hedgehog. It would later be followed by World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The Game Gear and Master System versions are slightly different in design, and though feature the same level themes, have different gameplay mechanics and simpler graphics/sound. These versions would be followed by Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse.

The game was bundled with Quackshot later in the Mega Drive's life, and also appeared with this game in a Sega Saturn collection.</desc>

    <desc>World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck is a Mega Drive/Genesis video game that was produced by Sega of America and released in 1992.

It is a semi-sequel to the previous games that Sega produced based on Walt Disney cartoon characters. In the game, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home. In Japan the title of the game was, Alive! Mickey &amp; Donald: Fushigi na Magic Box.

Gameplay:

The game's music, artwork and animation shows influences from classic Disney animated films, including; Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, The Sword in the Stone, Alice in Wonderland and Pinocchio. While often mistaken for a similar platform based video game, this game had many features that broke the mold.

The gameplay changes slightly depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.

Magic Spells

Along the way, Mickey and Donald learn new magic to perform in later levels.

- Magic Carpet (Level 1): Allowed Mickey and Donald to fly on a magic carpet in level 2.
- Underwater Bubble (Level 2): Allowed Mickey and Donald to breathe underwater.
- Magic Box Transportation (Level 3): Mickey and Donald could transport to different places using magic boxes.
- Card Control (Level 4) Mickey and Donald put certain large playing cards under their control, making a bridge or a pathway to the other side of a large gap.

    <desc>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.

Gameplay:

First, you choose whether to play as Mickey or Minnie, and then you choose from three difficulty levels. The player then learns of trouble in Beanswick. There is a strange rumbling over the castle and no one can explain it. Mickey (or Minnie) volunteers to investigate. He must go through a series of challenges in various rooms of the castle in order to collect magic beans and items. These tasks can be completed in any order, but all must be finished to beat the game.

Sorting Books

Books are floating up and down in the library of the Beanswick castle and Mickey must sort them in alphabetical order by jumping on them. Depending on difficulty, there are various numbers of books to be sorted and different patterns for the books to float in. Only a portion of the alphabet must be sorted. Once the books have been sorted, you receive an item.

Moving Potions

Mickey is transformed into a tiny size and placed on a chess-like game board. Potion bottles are on this board, as well as block obstacles that must be maneuvered around. The potion bottles are to be pushed into a magic mirror on the board. In harder difficluty games, there are more boards to play in increasing difficulty. Once all potions have been collected, you return to normal size and receive your item.

Picture Matching

This is a timed, memory challenge. Mickey must dust off portraits hanging on the castle walls in matching pairs. Basically, it's the matching card game. He must complete this task before the lights in the castle dim to darkness. Depending on difficulty, there are more or less pictures. For challenges with more pictures, more time is given. He is armed with a feather duster and sliding ladder. Match up all the pictures before time and light run out to receive item.

Playing the Pipes

This is a memory game. Several pipes light up and make different noises in a pattern that builds every turn. Mickey must listen, remember, and repeat what he heard. He can do this by jumping on the top of the pipes and playing the notes back in the proper order. The pipes only play one melody, adding one note after every time Mickey successfully completes the previous one. Difficulty of gameplay determines the length of the melody. Play all the right pipes to receive the item.

Guess the Tools

Goofy wants Mickey to guess what tools are in his toolbox. Mickey has seven attempts to successfully guess the tools and their order inside Goofy's toolbox. After each guess, a clue appears telling you how many and which tools you guessed in the correct order. In easier games, the tools turn red or green to denote correctness. In more difficult games, a small quartered square of red and green pieces tells Mickey which ones are right. Correctly guess what is in Goofy's toolbox to earn your item.

Exchanging Items

This is the segue of the game. The items Mickey collected were of no importance to their previous owners, but would serve useful to others in Beanswick. Mickey must go back to all of the others in each challenge and give them the item that suits them. In return for each correctly placed item, Mickey receives a magic bean. Only after retrieving all five beans can Mickey use them.

Using the Magic beans

After returning the items to their respective owners, Mickey visits the well. The annoying rumbling occurs again and Mickey throws his beans near the well. Suddenly, a giant beanstalk grows straight up into the clouds. A curious Mickey climbs the beanstalk into the clouds and encounters a giant. The giant is sound asleep and snoring. This massive snoring is the cause of all the trouble for Beanswick. There is a scrambled picture of an alarm clock floating next to the giant. Mickey must unscramble the picture by sliding the pieces and wake up the giant. After Mickey wakes up and talks to the giant, the troubles in Beanswick are solved.

Trivia:

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge's plot resembles bits of several fairytales, such as Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk.
Because of its simplistic gameplay, graphics, and lack of depth, this has been noted as one of the worst games made for Super NES.
Horace Horsecollar in the game is dressed as he was in The Prince and the Pauper

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Global Gladiators (also known as Mick and Mack: Global Gladiators) is a 1992 platform game by Virgin Interactive, originally programmed by David Perry for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and eventually ported by other Virgin Interactive teams to the Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear and the Commodore Amiga. A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message.

A Gameboy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port.

Gameplay:

In the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance.
They are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles.

The game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment.

Hints:

- Cheat Menu -
Press [C, B, A, Start] four times at the Sega logo to display the cheat menu screen.

- Extra Lives -
Pause game play and press A three times, B three times, C four times, B, and then A.

- Level Select -
Pause the game and press B, C, B, A, B, B, C, B, A, and B.

    <desc>The second game of the Micro Machines series. Like in its predecessor, you behind the steering wheel of an extremely small car. You race around on interesting places, like a table, a treehouse and many more. The control of the cars is sometimes quite difficult, especially if you don't know the tracks (the top-down view is not very clear). The CD-ROM version additionally features CD-Audio music and a track editor.

    <desc>This entry in the Micro Machines series flirts with a military theme. Using a top-down view, you race on different scaled-down tracks such as a pond, a kitchen table, a workbench, in the garden, .... The theme is reflected in the vehicles (helicopters, speedboats, tanks, supply trucks...), as well as in the music.

Up to 16 players can participate through the hot-seat party mode, but 8 racers can race simultaneously using the J-Cart and by sharing a part of the joypad. There are different game types, such as regular races (challenges), time trials, and battle arenas, in which you have to survive for a set amount of time while enemy vehicles charge. Other players can be shot to slow them down.

    <desc>Micro Machines: Turbo Tournament 96 is a sequel to Micro Machines 2 and although the gameplay and the typical top-down view still remain the same, this fun racing game offers a great number of new features.

Besides Challenge-Race, Head to Head-Race, League-Race, Time Trial Challenge-Race and Time Trial-Race, an outstanding Multiplayer Mode is included with the J-Cart. Just plug two additional joypads into the cartridge slots and up to 8 (!) players can race simultaneously on the same track (always two players sharing one pad). With an included Construction Kit, you can even create own tracks and store them. Up to nine tracks can be saved.

    <desc>Choose your vehicle and go! 27 fantastic circuits, Race Performance sports cars, Power boats, Helicopters, Formula One racing cars, Combat tanks, Highway warriors, 4 x 4's, Monster Trucks and Turbo wheels! Superb playability! Fast, furious, unstoppable racing action!

Gameplay:

Micro Machines on the Genesis was the same as it was on the NES, except the graphics were better. It's a lot like RC Pro AM in the way that it is played. The biggest difference was that you got to choose your own opponents. There were also a lot of different vehicles you could race, instead of just cars. Micro Machines were really big when I was a kid. I only had a couple, but a few of my buddies had a ton! I think the most memorable thing about Micro Machines is the guy on their old commercials that talked really fast. He was crazy. Micro Machines is a whole lot of fun, so give it a try! 

Directions:

Race against other Micro Machines in order to expand your collection.

Controls:

A Button: Gas
B Button: Brake
C Button: None
Start Button: Start/Pause

Hints:

- Shortcuts -
Be careful when taking shortcuts, if you cut too much of the track, the game will blow you up when you try to get back on track.

    <desc>The Midnight Resistance fighters are up against the awesome powers of mad scientist King Crimson and his Crimson Corps. Crimson has kidnapped your scientist grandfather and five more of your relatives, and aims to put his advanced plans to evil use.

Take control of a Resistance fighter in this scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of nine platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun bays en route. 

Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in at shop points for weapons. These weapons include machine guns and flamethrowers, for which ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded when you have no suitable ammo. The control system is unusual - you can shoot in different directions and crawl along low ledges.

Hints:

- Level Skip -
While you're at the title screen, highlight "Start Game", then hold C and press Start. Next, at any time during gameplay, pause the game and press A to go to the next level.

    <desc>Throughout the Cold War, little was known of the Soviet MiG fighter jets. The only thing the United States knew was that the MiG-29 was the world's most effective fighter. Now that the Cold War is over, you have the chance to be your very own Mig-29 Fighter Pilot and see what you were missing. The first thing you'll want to do is to get familiar with your new jet in the training missions. Once you feel ready for action, you can take on any of the five combat missions in the Middle East. As you engage in dogfights at speeds in excess of Mach 1, remember to keep an eye on your g-forces the last thing you want to do is black out and crash! With working instruments in the cockpit, realistic flight physics, and intense combat action, Mig-29 Fighter Pilot is the ultimate flight simulation.

    <desc>The third installment of the roleplaying series, with a multi-faceted plot full of twists and turns. Ease of use was central to the gameplay and interface, and the plot included piles of new twists and turns.

Lead a party of adventurers to rendezvous with the legendary wizard Corak. From dark moldy dungeons, through corridors of hewn stone and timber, and onward to the lofty frozen peaks of Terra you will uncover the mysteries that surround the exotic islands in the Great Sea.

Trivia:

In various dungeons in the game you are given Quatloo coins that you can spend in the Slithercult stronghold; quatloos are the coins used for placing bets on Star Trek crew members in the original Star Trek episode "The Gamesters of Triskelon".

    <desc>The Sequel to the successful Might and Magic I, it boasted better graphics, a larger world, but still pretty much the same game engine and presentation. Embark on a glorious journey then save the world of CRON and yourself.

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.

    <desc>Long ago and far away, a legendary interdimensional being know as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove, to establish a vanguard in the never ending battle against evil. With the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them power to transform into a superhuman fighting force. In time of great need, the young heroes could call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords". While the identity of the six remain a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of legend, earning them the title... 

The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 

This game plays much like the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers game for the Super Nintendo. In other words, it is very nice. The graphics are great, good quality for the Genesis. The sounds and music are nice. Music from the TV Show is used when playing through different stages. The game-play is superb as well, fighting various enemies and giving you a good time to keep you going for a while. Give this a try if you're a fan of Power Rangers or platform games.

Directions:

In this game, you play through six stages of karate-kickin', mighty morphin' action! In the beginning, you can pick the ranger of your choice... 

There are six ones you can play as. Tommy the White Ranger, Rocky the Red Ranger, Adam the Black Ranger, Billy the Blue Ranger, Kimberly the Pink Ranger, and Aisha, the Yellow Ranger. 

In each stage, you must be able to make it through in the time given. You are usually encountered by a group of baddies, and you are given a starting time of 60 seconds. When you're able to beat them, the clock gives you more time. 

Power-ups might also be needed. In this case, Power Coins will be dropped when you defeat enemies. Each one gives a unique reward. 

There's also special attacks not listed in the Controls section. To run, tap the desired direction, left or right, twice. To attack when running, press B. When you hold B for a while, you can release it to unleash a more stronger attack. Press B repeatedly to do a combo attack.

Controls:

A Button: Special Move (WILL TAKE AWAY LIFE!)
B Button: Attack
C Button: Jump

Hints:

- Power Coin Uses. -
Mastodon Coin: Adds 1000 points to total 
Pterodactyl Coin: Restores one bar of Health 
Sabertooth Tiger Coin: Adds 3000 points 
Triceratops Coin: Restores half health bar

    <desc>An evil empress by the name of Rita Repulsa has made her dark presence felt when she had escaped from a space dumpster. She has devious plans to conquer the planet Earth, alongside her legion of minions. It's up to the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, Jason, Zack, Billy, Kimberly, and Trini, to go into battle with Rita and vanquish her forces with their weapons and power. Will they be able to send the queen packing? Or will Earth's fate be spelled out in doom? 

For those who absolutely love fighting games done in a style similar of Mortal Kombat And Street Fighter, I think most will find some enjoyment in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers for the Sega Genesis. The graphics are done very nicely, each fighting stage detailed as well as the adversaries you face. The sound is pretty neat, too, who doesn't love the nostalgic theme song most of us know and love? If you're a fan of fighting games, the original MMPR, or both, you'll be sure to have hours of fun with this one. Recommended, highly recommended.

Controls:

A Button: Weak Attack
B Button: Strong Attack
C Button: Nothing
X Button: Nothing
Y Button: Nothing
Z Button: Nothing
Start Button: Pause
Mode Button: Nothing

Hints:

- Evil Green Ranger in 2P Battle Mode -
When the Banpresto screen appears, press A, B, and C on the second player control repeatedly. You should hear the sound "Power Rangers". The Evil Green Ranger should now be available for use.

You'll find all kinds of unique and powerful options at your fingertips with this game: four different passing modes, the ability to make substitutions, 28 teams to choose from, and legendary referee Jim Tunney. As if that weren't enough, you'll also have more than 80 plays to choose from, and a unique behind-the-kicker perspective that makes field goal kicking a more integral part of the game. Strap on the pads and get ready for some hard-nosed football the way it should be played with MIKE DITKA POWER FOOTBALL.

    <desc>The strategy of baseball is merged with a fast-paced arcade game in MLBPA Baseball from Electronic Arts. Details designed to appeal to the die-hard fan include: real players with statistics based on the 1993 season; a full 162 game season mode; stadium music; animated scoreboards; defensive alignments; cut-off plays; run-downs; and even the double switch. Features meant to appeal to the casual fan include: large colorful arcade graphics; one stadium with animated crowds; a simplified pitching interface allowing players to steer the ball; and a batting interface that relies on timing instead of aiming cursors. Secret power-up play modes await so step up to the plate and take some hacks! Season play can be continued using passwords provided at the end of each game.

    <desc>Parker Brothers' MONOPOLY Real Estate Trading Game was presented to Parker Brothers during the Depression by Charles B. Darrow of Germantown, Pennsylvania. Darrow had made the first games by hand, given them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. But as demand grew, he could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to acquire the rights to the game in 1935.

Since then, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States but throughout the Western world. It is published under license in 32 countries and in 23 foreign languages!

This Sega Genesis version of the MONOPOLY game conforms to all the rules of the board game and some of the rules used in tournament play. The beauty of this version is that the system acts as the Banker and takes care of all the accounting and money management tasks - which speeds up play and prevents mathematical errors in the High Finance Department!

Note, too, that we've created a special series of 12 Wheel and Deal Preset Games. These four-player game setups assume you have already acquired certain properties and assign all players a certain amount of cash, which varies from scenario to scenario, so you can "cut to the chase" and begin the game at the high-stakes trading level. You may also create your own preset game by selecting "Options"; this way, you decide who gets what.

--From the Genesis Monopoly instruction manual.

Overview:

It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times. The Depression was still rolling on and what game did people love? That's right, one about tossing poor people into the streets. Nothing like "Fuzzy Bear brings Christmas Cheer to the Forest". Nope, nothing about lovable and generous neighbors harvesting your wheat for you. No, this game was about grabbing all of the gusto and chunking little Miss Maybell, the beloved elderly school teacher, out in the cold on her wrinkly butt. So if you are looking for a game with love and compassion, don't play Monopoly, play Resident Evil.

Excellent graphics, sounds and game action. Not much more to say, the computer game plays like the board game. One major problem is that if you make a mistake playing against the computer, you cannot undo it. The computer will blissfully move along ignoring all of your protests.

The great difference between playing the board game and the computer version is that even Charles Manson can play. "Friends? We don't need no stinking friends". So like Solitaire and Pro Basketball, you can play the game alone. Not that you have to. I mean, you can always invite Britney Spears and Lyndsay Lohan over for a spirited game. I do it all the time. Of course I end up playing alone against the computer. As you are likely to, also.

Directions:

Most of the choices that you make will have prompting on the screen telling you the appropriate buttons to select.

If you press the C Button to bring up the Main Menu, you will be asked which player you are. Choose the appropriate player with the D-Control and press the "A" Button. The Main Menu displays Buildings, Mortgages, Trades, Deeds and General. Select which one you want.

When you land on a piece of property, you can buy it or put it up for auction. If you put it up for auction, the Auction Screen opens and you have a chance to bid against the other players in the game.

To see what everybody has: property, cash, "Get Out of Jail Free" card, press the B button on your turn.

To get out of jail, you can chance rolling doubles on your turn or press the C Button to bring up the Main Menu. From the Main Menu, select the "Get Out of Jail" option to either use a "Get Out of Jail Free" card, if you have one, or to pay $50.00 if you don't.

Trading:

The process of trading can appear to be complex but actually isn't. First choose the Main Menu with the C Button, and then naturally select "Trade" with the D-Control and the A Button. Using the D-Control, point the Rich Uncle's hand towards your player and then select Property or Cash. Then using the D-Control and the "A" Button, choose the properties that you want to trade and/or the amount of cash that you are offering (D-Control UP or DOWN allows to change the cash value). If you are playing against the computer, you must do the same for him. Then move the Rich Uncle's hand to your Accept and push the A Button. If trading with a human player, they would do the same. If playing against the computer, he will evaluate the deal and accept it or refuse it. The computer is not stupid, so don't expect to get any easy deals.

Buying Houses or Hotels:

Press the C Button to bring up the Main Menu and choose Buildings. Choose buy houses or hotels. The screen should then allow you to scroll to the property that you want to place the buildings on. Then you should be given a screen allowing you to choose the number of houses to buy.

Selling Houses or Hotels:
Similar to Buying House or Hotels except it is a buyer's market; you sell at a great loss.

Controls:

A Button: Select/Buy/Bid/Menu
B Button: Auction/Assets
C Button: Main Menu
Start Button: Start Game

Hints:

20/20 Hindsight Advice
Don't invest in ENRON

Trivia:

The Sega Master System version (others might, too) of this game uses the classical music piece "The Entertainer", composed by Scott Joplin, for the theme song.

This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".

Translation Description

What do you all think of when you think of Sega games? That's right, you think of Wonderboy, because the Wonderboy games kick ass. All of them. Even Wonderboy in Monsterland. And Monster World 4 is no different.

Some people have told me that Wonderboy and Monster World are two completely different series, but they sure as hell play the same to me, so nyah. Anyway you play a cute girl with green hair, and you walk around and kill stuff. It RULES. And it's really really pretty, especially for such a crap system as the Genesis. Or the Mega Drive, whatever. It just rules, dammit. Go play. Enjoy. Hit Up to talk to people. Use the crystal DIRECTLY in front of the statue. And thank Demi for this kickass translation, which is now free of bugs. No more goddamn flickering. Kickass? Yaya.

    <desc>This rom hack is mostly for fixing those DULLARD cheat menu options to have more clear descriptions, like the Sega CD version has. But I also enabled the blood and changed "Rayden" to have his correct name "Raiden".

This patch makes a couple of minor changes to the Rev 00 game.

Mostly it changes the cheat menu's to have menu names like the Sega CD version to be more clear in their use.

I also enabled blood from the start and changed "Rayden" to be "Raiden" as he is called in the arcade counterparts.

    <desc>An evil wizard by the name of Shang Tsung held a tournament for the 7 best fighters he selected. Only the best fighter can succeed! But is Shang Tsung someone to be trusted? Play and find out for yourself! Oh, and did I mention all the blood?

Gameplay:

The game was a response by Midway to Capcom's successful Street Fighter II, which spawned a number of fighting games. However, it used a distinctly different fighting system from the Street Fighter formula, which was used in all subsequent sequels until Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. The controls consisted of five buttons arranged in an "X" pattern: a high punch, a high kick, a low punch, a low kick, and a block button, as well as an eight-way joystick.

If the two fighters were standing next to each other, hitting any of the attack buttons would result in a modified strike: a low punch turned into a throw, a high punch turned into a heavy elbow, head butt, or backhand, and either kick turned into a knee strike. Crouching and hitting high punch resulted in an uppercut, which was the most damaging attack of the game. Jump kicking and crouch-kicking were executed in a similar fashion to Street Fighter, although leg sweeps and roundhouse kicks were performed by holding away while pressing the appropriate kick button.

The blocking in Mortal Kombat by itself greatly changed the flow of fighting in comparison to contemporary games which used Street Fighter conventions. Characters do not block while retreating or crouching, but only block when the block button is pushed. Even then, characters take (reduced) damage from any hit while blocking. However, successfully blocking moves is simple - a crouching block can successfully defend against all moves, even aerial attacks such as jump kicks - and blocking characters give very little ground when struck rather than sliding backwards. This style of blocking rewarded dodging to avoid damage but also made counterattacks much easier after a successful block, and the ultimate result was an environment which rewards a more furtive playing style than contemporary games.

Each of the seven playable characters move and fight in the exact same fashion, which led to complaints that the characters lacked distinction. However, each character's moves differed in their hit detection, speed, and damage. For example, Kano's crouching kick dealt more damage than other characters' crouching kicks, while Raiden's jump kick had a longer range than other jump kicks.

The game retained a similar scoring system (based on successful hits, the Test Your Might minigame and other bonuses) to those games; this would be dropped in later entries to the Mortal Kombat series in favor of counting wins.

Another of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a beaten opponent to kill them in a gruesome fashion. For example, Sub-Zero would grasp a defeated opponent by the head, then rip out the head and spine while the body crumpled to the ground in a pool of blood.

Mortal Kombat also introduced the concept of juggling, an idea so popular it has spread to many games and even other genres. Juggling takes advantage of the fact that when a character is knocked into the air, that player is unable to control his or her character and is still vulnerable to other hits, until he or she lands and gets up again. The idea behind juggling is to knock the enemy into the air and then follow up with other combat moves to keep them there. Theoretically, one could juggle one's opponent to death without ever taking damage, though this was difficult to accomplish in practice. In early versions of the game, juggling was extremely easy because the physics caused characters to fly upwards when hit; by version 5.0, however, characters reacted with somewhat more realism, and also fell more rapidly with successive hits, effectively limiting juggles to 3 hits under normal circumstances.

Mortal Kombat also changed the way special moves were performed. Street Fighter (and many other fighting games) performed most special moves in fractions of circles (usually full, half or one-quarter) on the joystick followed by a button press (such as a quarter-circle forward + punch). Mortal Kombat was the first to introduce moves that did not require a button press (such as tap back, tap back, then forward), and only a few of the special moves required circular joystick movement. Finally, Mortal Kombat was the first versus-fighting game to feature a secret character: Reptile.

Directions:

You can fight through a ladder of opponents such as any fighting game today. There is also a VS. mode where players 1 and 2 can go at it! Choose from these seven characters: Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kano, Sonya Blade, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Raiden! When the person's health is really low, try to use a fatality!

Controls:

A Button: Low Punch
B Button: Block
C Button: Low Kick
X Button: High Punch
Y Button: Block
Z Button: High Kick
Start Button: Start game

Hints:

    <desc>This one is definitely the oddest of them all. Mortal Combat 5 (as it reads on the title screen) is an attempt to re-create the Playstation game Mortal Kombat Mythologies on the Genesis. All sprites in this game have been ripped out of previous Genesis Mortal Kombat games (I assume Ultimate MK 3 was used). You control Sub-Zero and battle through sprite-swapped variations of Kano, Sonya or Liu Kang, running through levels which are visually designed to resemble their Playstation counterparts. The backgrounds constantly repeat themselves, which makes the maze-like design of the stages irritatingly hard! Also, there are a lot of cheap instant-kill deathtraps in this game that increase the insane base difficulty even more (the difficulty settings in the option screen seem like a bad joke). However, this game is strangely compelling, so you keep playing nevertheless even though you know it'll only frustrate you.

In theory, the whole thing is rather short and incomplete (it apparently ends abruptly after stage four), but it certainly doesn't feel that way!

    <desc>The Pacman series is a monster in the classic video game world. It started a new genre when it came out in Japan in 1979. Most games coming out at the time were either space shooters or pong-like sports games. This new genre appealed to both males and females. This made it so popular, it inspired more than thirty officially licensed sequels, numerous bootlegs, home-brews, and clones, a plethora of merchandise, a top forty pop song, and even an animated series. This addition to the series came from an unofficial bootleg called Crazy Otto. Fearing a lawsuit from the Namco, Midway signed the rights to them and Ms. Pacman was born.

It plays just like Pacman, except it has different mazes and the bonus items move around the board. It was a lot of fun to play! The graphics were great, and so were the sounds and controls. The different difficulty levels made this game pretty interesting, too. If you put the difficulty on crazy, it was just that. Everything would be moving so fast, I don't think there is a human that could keep up. Another cool thing about Ms. Pac-Man was the addition of the story scenes. As you play through the game, you will see scenes of Mr. and Ms. Pac-Man meeting, falling in love, and getting visits from the stork. When you beat the game, you get to see all the kids running around. This game is a lot of fun, and if you are a Pacman fan, you will go nuts over this game!

Directions:

Eat all the dots in the maze. There will sometimes be fruit that you can eat for bonus points. Avoid the ghosts. If one touches you, you die. When you eat the big dot, you are able to eat the ghosts during a short period of time.

Once that time is up, it's back to them getting you! They added a Pac-Booster to this game, which was cool. It made you go faster. In the options you could set it to be on when you hit one of the buttons, or you could set it to be always on or off.
The object is to get as many points as you can, but you actually can beat the game. After you beat the last level, a cute little animation will be your reward.

Controls:

D-pad: Choose direction
A, B, or C Button: Pac-booster (when activated)
Start Button: Pause

Hints:

- Easy Levels -
If you put the maze selection on mini, the levels will be smaller and therefore have less dots to eat.

    <desc>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing is a boxing video game that was developed by Park Place Productions and published by Virgin Interactive in 1992. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive / Sega Genesis console.

The game features Muhammad Ali, and 9 fictional heavyweight boxers. The game uses a mixture of 2D sprites and 3D ring to allow boxers to move 360 degrees about the ring.

In career mode, the player can choose to fight as any of the game's 10 boxers. They start at rank 10 in the heavyweight division, and fight their way through all the others in order.

Gameplay:

During fights, available punches to be throw include jabs, hooks, crosses and uppercuts. In simulation mode it is possible to choose to throw any type of punch with either hand, whereas in arcade mode, the player chooses which type of punch to throw and the Megadrive determines which of the boxer's fists is the most appropriate to throw it. Defensive manoeuvers include blocking and clinching. The more punches a boxer throws, the less damage their punches do.

The game can be played in either arcade or simulation mode. Many in-game features are customizeable, including ring length, number of rounds, and the length of time a boxer must be floored to be classed as knocked out.

The visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers, and a simple 3D rendering of the ring. The boxers' sprites include views of them from a side-on position, and from viewpoints that show them having turned a small distance clockwise or anti-clockwise around the ring. As a boxer attempt to moves around the ring, the appropriate series of sprites are shown, which works to give the illusion of them turning about (or attempting to).

Blood effects simulate the cuts that boxers sometimes suffer during matches. However, the effect is wildly exaggerated in the game, so that huge splashes of blood can sometimes be seen flying off a boxer's face. Blood stains remain on the ring floor for the rest of a match; combined with the amount of blood that comes out of fighters' faces, this often leads to much of the ring being covered in it by the end of a match. The damage received to a boxer's face is shown by close-up pictures that are shown between rounds. Such images show wounds such as bloody noses or black eyes. Such wounds start off semi-realistic, but after sustained punishment, often develop into wildly exaggerated versions of the kind of injuries boxers suffer- in the later rounds of a fight, boxers' faces will sometimes be ripped open by so many large, gaping cuts that they are practically unrecognisable as human beings, let alone individual boxers.

Rather than providing an accurate representation of reality, the game's sound effects reflect an attempt to make the game more exciting by exaggerating the impact force of punches. The effects for hard punches, in particular, sound extremely forceful, being more reminiscent of a car door being slammed shut than boxing-glove covered fists impacting with another person.

The game featured digitised speech effects for the introduction of fighters, knockdown counts, and the announcement of the outcome of a fight. It is also one of the few boxing games to depict an in-game referee.

While after each fight, judges' scorecards are shown for each round, these almost always have no bearing on who the winner is. This is because the winner is decided solely by whichever boxer lands more punches in a fight. The only occasion these scorecards decide an outcome is if both fighters land the exact same number of punches during a fight.

Trivia:

The in-game boxer, Bruno Franko, is a play on the name of real-life heavyweight boxer, Frank Bruno.

This is a Beta version of the game, development was stopped due to the introduction of newer 32bit consoles and the demise of the Genesis/Mega-Drive. Unfortunately it shows, poor graphics (especially for a Disney game) and sound with poor level design make this more of a curiosity than anything else.

    <desc>A spin-off from the successful Aleste series by Compile, Musha Aleste takes the same top-down shooter mechanics of it's predecessors but stages the action in a bizarre universe that merges traditional Japanese lore with sci-fi mecha action.

Instead of commanding a ship, you will actually step into the cockpit of a ninja-styled mecha as you fight through the many levels in the game, with several option satellites that can be configured to use different formations.

Hints:

- Five Bonus Lives: -
To earn five bonus lives, pause the game and push Right, Down, Right, Down, Left, Up, Left, Up, B, C, A and than Start.

    <desc>Mystical Fighter is a beat 'em up game. This game is known in Japan as Mao Renjishi. Mao literally means demon king in Japanese.

The story, designs, and characters are base on Japanese mythology. Like in most scrolling fighters, the player (who controls a kabuki) can use combos, flips and swings fight against tough opponents. There is also a timed limit, usually about forty seconds, for the player to finish the stage. If the time reaches zero before the player passes the stage it results in a defeat. Similar to Golden Axes the player can use a special magic power, but instead of bottles the player must manually pick up scrolls. The more scrolls the player has the stronger the magic attack will be, however if the player chooses to use this attack all the scrolls will consumed.

Gameplay:

Despite the time limit the player will spend most of the time mashing mainly the A and B button while fighting three to five opponents at in time. There are also hidden bonus stages that can be accessed if the player approaches certain doors or rooms. These bonus stages depend on which level they are located in and contain either magic scrolls or items to increase the character's health bar. The boss fights are often easier than regular enemies. There are also traps and holes that both the player or the enemies could fall in if they are not careful. The traps and pits do not always hinder the player, and in fact can be beneficial if the player throws an enemy directly into the pit.

    <desc>Mystic Defender (based on the Japanese title Kujaku? 2: Geneij?) is a side-scrolling platform game. It is the sequel to SpellCaster for the Sega Master System. However, in this sequel the RPG elements have been omitted in favour of side-scrolling platform gameplay.

In this game you play Joe Yamata (Kujaku) on a quest to rescue Alexandra from the villainous Zao, who is using her soul to resurrect his master Zareth in Azuchi castle. You have four types of magic to attack with and you can charge your blasts as well as change the magic type mid-game.

The game also includes three Hall of Fame teams filled with 30 all-time greats such as Bill Walton, "Pistol Pete" Maravich, and Dr. J.

Other features include: adjustable quarters (4, 8 and 12 minutes), fouls, instant replay, a Shot Chart, fatigue, an optional ball indicator to help determine the release point, and a Role Play option which allows you to play the entire game as one player! Having some trouble with your offense? Players can call three plays to help them gain an advantage: pick/screen, clear out and the double screen. Battery backup will save team statistics and league standings in your quest to bring home the championship, and up to five players can play at once with a Team Player adaptor.

NBA HangTime is a two-on-two hoops contest in the tradition of NBA Jam and NBA Jam T.E. Choose from 29 NBA teams and 145 professional stars with ratings based on the 1995-96 season, or create your own players and save them to battery. Customize your athlete's head, uniform, attributes, or name, and then build his ratings by winning games or correctly answering trivia questions. Sixteen different heads allow you to create offbeat characters such as aliens or clowns.

Moves include alley oops, spin moves, double dunks, and team "fire" (players get hot after making three shots in a row). Up to four players can compete simultaneously in venues ranging from a rooftop and jungle arena to a harbor and city court. Enter in codes to unlock hidden characters, power-ups, and other bonuses. The game will also keep track of statistics such as points-per-game average, longest winning streak, most games played, and overall winning percentage.

    <desc>This sequel to the popular NBA Jam doubles the number of NBA players and secret characters, so you can now make substitutions after every quarter. Nine new earth shattering dunks have been added to the lineup and a battery will save your records, ranking and winning percentage against the 27 featured NBA teams. Perhaps the biggest additions are the Hot Spots option, which places random circles on the court with different point values, and Power-Up Icons, which will temporarily affect a player's abilities. Otherwise, it's the same two-on-two dunk fest as the original.

For those unfamiliar with NBA Jam, the action is played from a horizontal view of the court as you control one player on offense. The object is to score as many points as you can while trying to prevent the other team from doing the same. Controls on offense consist of a passing, shooting and turbo button, while defense replaces the shooting button with a jump. By pressing the turbo button, players can not only move faster, but perform special moves such as acrobatic dunks or gravity defying jumps. Grab up to three friends and everyone can play at the same time with an adapter!

Controls:

A: Shoot
B: Turbo
C: Pass
D-Pad: Move player

    <desc>NBA Jam is a two-on-two basketball game You can play any NBA team, and you can play as players like Barkley, Starks, Pippen, and Grant. Each human player controls a single player, so choose your squad wisely to take team-mate skill into account. The game is action-oriented, and players can perform unrealistic slam-dunks. Full performance statistics are automatically recorded. The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.

Hints:

Always on Fire Mode
At the Tonight's Match-up Screen enter the following code... 

Hit any button 7 times then hold Up and press B + C 

If you entered the code correctly you should be on fire the whole game.

    <desc>Electronic Arts abandons the engine found in their previous four Genesis basketball games with the release of NBA Live 95. The title features a new 30 degree perspective to expand your view of the court and a TV-style presentation that updates player stats, streaks and shooting percentages along the bottom of the screen.

Passing on the run, blocks, alley-oops and dunks are also included to give you complete control of the action. Use the turbo button to streak by defenders trying to stop your drive to the net! Those who prefer a more strategic game will appreciate the 46 offensive plays and four defensive sets. 

Three difficulty levels, four different quarter settings, and thirteen rules (including fatigue and injuries) can be adjusted to suit your style of play. Game modes include playing a full or reduced Season, Exhibition game or Playoffs. This 16-Meg cartridge offers battery backup to save user, team and individual player statistics along with season records and playoff position. 

All 27 NBA teams from the 1994-95 season are included (ratings are based on the 1993-94 season), as well as two All-Star and four custom teams. Key differences from the Super Nintendo version include: complete statistical tracking during season, 4 Way Play support, automatic steals and updated rosters.

All of the players, but the one you are currently controlling, will freeze. This allows you to practice with a shot percentage.

    <desc>NBA Live 96 contains all of the aspects of NBA basketball. Real teams and players are featured along with a create player option. The create player option allows this game to include all of the NBA superstars who may not be included in the NBA players license. Simply type in a players name who is not in the game and he will be created. This also works with many past NBA players, many of which are now in the Hall of Fame.

Aside from all of the players included, NBA Live 96 has a lot of gameplay options. More than 60 offensive plays and 10 defensive sets. Season, exibition, and playoff modes, including an NBA draft option. You can also play with the 2 all-star teams or create 4 custom teams. There is also 4-Way Play compatibility for 4 player action.

NBA Live 96 provides basketball action with plenty of options and realistic gameplay.

    <desc>Basketball returns to the Genesis with NBA Live 97, the third game in Electronic Arts' NBA Live series. In addition to the crossover dribbles, alley-oops, tip slams and behind-the-back passes, there are now reverse layups and dunks. Stealing the ball from an opponent can finally be performed manually, and a new player lock feature allows you the chance to play as one professional throughout the game. Choose from 29 NBA, two All-Star and four custom teams as you embark on a Season, Exhibition game or round of Playoffs. 

While the rosters have been updated to reflect the 1996-97 season (including rookies and Shaquille O'Neal), you can either trade, release or create players and save them to battery. New two-on-two and three-on-three halfcourt games have been added along with three-point and shoot-out competitions. Of course, an EA Sports game would not be complete without stat tracking, and NBA Live 97 lets you record player statistics, team leaders, league leaders and playoff stats. Coaches take note: over 60 offensive plays and 10 defensive sets are here, as is on-the-fly playcalling. Call the intentional foul to stop Shaq from driving down the lane!

    <desc>The fourth and final game in Electronic Arts' NBA Live series on Genesis features new team and player practice modes, trades based on player ratings, and a computer-generated All-Star game decided by the top performers from around the league. The game's 29 teams and 300 players have also been updated to reflect their actual abilities during the 1996-97 season, and the NBA season schedule mirrors the one used during 1997-98.

Returning to the game are both three-on-three and two-on-two half-court modes as well as the option to create, edit, or trade players. Four custom teams are also available, and players can compete in individual three-point and shoot-out contests apart from the main action. The game is still played from a three-quarter perspective with TV-style updates that display the score as well as individual statistics during each quarter. Notable moves include reverse layups, alley-oops, spins, crossover dribbles, and baseball passes.

Up to four players can participate in an exhibition, season, playoff or practice game on one of three difficulty levels: rookie, starter or all-star. Options include adjustable quarters (from three to twelve minutes), a choice of an arcade or a simulation play style (which determines if players tire, get injured, or foul out), and custom rules such as backcourt violations or goal tending. Battery backup saves season progress, user records, roster moves, and custom teams.

    <desc>NCAA Football features forty Division I-A teams in your choice of two game modes: Exhibition or Tournament. Exhibition lets you pick any two teams for a single game against either the computer or a friend, while Tournament involves taking your favorite team through sixteen games in an effort to win the Championship.

NCAA Football adopts a horizontal perspective and control scheme not unlike Tecmo Super Bowl -- scroll through your receivers by tapping a button and then fire the pass using a second button. The ball carrier can then run, dive, lateral or spin. On defense, players can switch to the closest defender at any time in order to make the tackle.

Other notable features include: over sixty plays on offense and defense; college teams spanning four decades (from the '60s to the '90s); adjustable quarter lengths; multiple weather conditions; instant replay; and battery backup to save tournament progress after the console is turned off. NCAA Football is also available for the Super Nintendo.

    <desc>The first college basketball game for the Sega Genesis, NCAA Final Four Basketball features 64 NCAA Division I teams, five player support with the use of a multiplayer adapter, and three different play modes: Practice, Tournament and Exhibition. Exhibition is one game against any two teams of your choice, Practice Mode allows you to hone your skills without worrying about a pesky defense (it's just two players and the ball), and Tournament lets you pick one team with the goal of moving past the Regionals and into the Final Four. There's also a mode that involves practicing your three-point shooting skills, with a perspective just behind the player's head looking toward the basket.

NCAA Final Four Basketball offers an in-depth control system, allowing for three different passes (chest, overhead and bounce), fake shots and jumps, intentional fouls, bank shots, and dunks or layups. Players can also choose one of six different defensive formations to keep the offense guessing, including man, zone and pressure defenses from either half or full court. Rounding out the package are fouls (easy going, none or strict), player fatigue, instant replay and adjustable game length (10, 20, 30 or 40 minutes). Battery backup allows tournament progress to be resumed after the console is turned off.

    <desc>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. 

The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race. A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.

Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.

    <desc>A must play hack of Sonic the Hedgehog. Marble, Starlight and Green hill zone bosses have been changed to be completely hard and at some points just insane.

More than just the bosses though, theres the spindash, theres also new pallets. Green Hill Zone is completely done. The beginning of clock work is done, the "doom path" in Labyrinth is changed. There is even a nice transition from Labyrinth to marble. Level order is changed too:

- Green Hill
- Labyrinth
- Marble
- Star Light
- Sparkling (spring yard)
- Clock work(Scrap Brain)

If you like sonic hacks I strongly encourage you to try this one.

    <desc>Take to land, sea, and air as you help Tiki rescue twenty of his friends from Wally the hungry walrus. Armed with a bow and arrow, players control Tiki as he travels all over New Zealand in search of his caged pals. Power-ups such as bombs and laser guns will aid Tiki's quest, and players can commandeer flying vehicles to take down enemies and gain access to higher platforms. Spelling "EXTEND" will earn an extra life, and if players lose their final life in later stages they will have a chance to extend their playing time by competing in "Heaven" rounds.

    <desc>NFL '95 improves the passing game of previous Sega football titles by allowing the player to see up to 65 yards down the field. The view is not fixed, however; it will dynamically change during play. Whenever a running back or receiver grabs the ball, the camera will zoom in for a close-up of the action. You can also elect to play as the receiver from the line of scrimmage, so you can run your own route and then signal for the ball. 

Both the NFL and NFLPA licenses are included, so all 28 pro teams are here as well as over 1,500 players rated in thirteen categories based on the 1993 season. Full season play is also available with multiple schedules, instant replays, injuries, trades, free agents and playoffs in your bid to become Super Bowl champion. Battery backup means you can track league leaders and save team standings through an entire season, along with the records of up to seven users.

    <desc>NFL 98, Sega's final football game for the Genesis platform, uses the same engine as found in Prime Time Football starring Deion Sanders. Updates include player statistics and ratings based on the 1996 season, the ability to play a full 1997 schedule, Practice Mode, adjustable artificial intelligence settings, and the option to view both instructions and rules of play within the game.

The most notable new feature is customizing how either the computer or your team plays in the following areas (from zero to six, with six being the highest): player speed, speed burst effect, dive effect, defensive tackling, offensive fumbles, blocking, pass accuracy, aggressiveness, cause interceptions, pass deflections, pass interference, CPU kick accuracy, kick meter speed and injuries. Besides the different settings found within the Rookie, Veteran, All-Pro and Hall of Fame difficulty levels, you can save up to four custom settings per team. 

All other features are carried over from 1995's game, except for the option to play multiple season schedules. Players can still adjust game time (5,10 or 15 minute quarters), weather, field conditions, and even choose their own playbook from any team in the game. Speaking of which, 30 NFL teams are included from the 1996 season, as well as both AFC and NFC Stars, NFL All-Pros and six regional teams featuring stars organized by where they went to college. 

Complete roster management lets you organize your team as you see fit, including trades, substitutions, signing or releasing fee agents, and creating new players. Battery backup will store your season in progress, allow you to create and save up to 15 user records, track each team in 42 different categories and individual players in 32 areas. As in the previous two Sega football games, NFL 98 uses a vertical view of the field that will zoom in for a closeup once the ball crosses the line of scrimmage.

    <desc>The 24-Meg NFL Quarterback Club offers three different ways to play: QB Challenge, Simulation Mode and NFL Play. The QB Challenge has you choosing a quarterback (or creating up to five of your own) as you prepare to compete in four events: distance; accuracy; speed and mobility; and read and recognition. Simulation Mode has you playing through one of thirty different scenarios, while NFL Play lets players embark on a full 16-game Season, Preseason, Playoffs, or Pro Bowl with progress saved to battery. 

While the game does not feature an NFLPA license for real players, it does offer nineteen actual quarterbacks from the 1993 season, including Steve Young, Dan Marino, John Elway and Troy Aikman. Other notable features include: over 430 plays to choose from; instant replay; variable weather (fair, rain or snow); custom audibles; three difficulty levels (rookie, pro or all-pro); adjustable quarter lengths (from one to fifteen minutes); and player animation showing taunts, spikes, high-steps, and various other moves.

    <desc>Lace up your skates, grab your stick, and hit the ice with NHL Hockey for the Sega Genesis. The game features 22 NHL teams with players modeled on actual NHL athletes. Once in the rink, you'll need to quickly learn the skills of skating, passing and shooting, or you'll be shutout by the competition. You can play rough, but watch out for the ref. He'll be watching out for any illegal contact like slashing and tripping.

Choose to play a regular season game, or fight your way through the playoffs to the Stanley Cup Finals. A variety of options allow you to tailor the game to your skill level, including the ability select the length of the game and to turn penalties on or off. You can also play against a friend, or decide to team up together against a computer opponent.

This time around full NHLPA rosters are included as well as the ability to create and save team lines via the battery backup. Realistic elements have also been added such as player fights and a pane of glass behind the goal that can now be shattered. Injuries can knock players out of a period or a game, and will cause the injured player to release a small pool of blood onto the ice. Classic features include instant replay and two-player cooperative mode.

    <desc>The third game in EA SPORTS' acclaimed hockey series for the Genesis, NHL '94 brings together both the NHL and the NHLPA licenses for the first time. Twenty-five new features have been added to the game, including four-player support with the 4 Way Play adapter, manual goalie control, penalty shots, one timers, seventy pieces of organ music (sampled from actual arenas around the league), Shootout Mode, and battery back-up to save individual records (seven in total). 

Player ratings and rosters are based on the 1992-93 season and both expansion teams, Anaheim and Florida, are here as well. Improvements in the graphics include new checking animations, fans pounding the glass and team logos at center ice. Two things are missing from the previous version, however: fighting and blood. Other than these omissions, the game remains faithful to its lineage. Take to the ice and bring home the Stanley Cup!

B Button: Pass puck.
C Button: Speed burst (body check).
D-Pad: Control direction of pass.

OFFENSE

    <desc>NHL '95 is one game in a prolific series of fast-paced hockey simulations from EA Sports. You choose from amongst the 1994 rosters and take the ice with players such as Sergei Federov and Joe Sakic.

In NHL '95, for the Sega Genesis, up to four players face off from an overhead perspective. NHL '95 contains all the trappings of a real game and the graphics are fluid and smooth. You have the option to adjust realistic features such as penalties, off-sides and line changes. In addition, NHL '95 offers a full season mode with in depth statistics, trades, and player creation. You can even practice your breakaway moves on the "shootout" mode.

Controls:

OFFENCE

A: Flip puck down ice.
Hold A: Bring up line menu.
B: Pass, you control the direction with d-pad.
C: Shoot, you control the direction with the d-pad and the power with the duration of your depression.
Start: Pause.

DEFENCE

A: "Stick work"
Hold A: Bring up line change menu.
B: Switch to nearest player to the puck.
C: Speed burst or "check."

    <desc>Electronic Arts' longstanding hockey franchise comes to a 16-bit end with NHL 98, the seventh game released in the Genesis series. While the same engine found in both NHL 96 and NHL 97 is used in this game, there are a few new features that set this title apart from the rest. These include the following: three different game speeds to choose from; a two-line pass rule; a "Coaching Style" menu allowing players to apply one of five strategies (offense, defense, balanced, all-out offense or all-out defense) to different lines; updated team rosters to reflect the 1997 season; player ratings based on the 1996 season; automatic goalie switching; and enhanced penalty awareness. 

Returning to the game are 26 NHL teams, two All-Star squads, and three National teams (United States, Canada and Europe). Battery backup will track statistics, season progress and All-Time Records in thirteen categories, including "Most Breakaways," "Fastest Goal" and "Best Shooting Percentage." The seven game modes consist of Regular Game, Playoffs, Best-of-Seven Playoffs, Season, Shootout, Practice, and Skills Challenge. Complete roster management lets you trade, create, release or sign players, so you can put yourself in the game if you so desire! Up to four players can play simultaneously with the 4-Way Play adapter.

Controls:

OFFENSE

D-Pad: Move player, control direction of shot
A: Clear puck/flip pass
B: Pass puck
C: Wrist-shot (hold for slap shot) or one-timer without the puck
A + D-Pad Up or Down: Drop pass
Start: Pause game, go to menu screen

DEFENSE

A: Holds/hooks (tap A for a block shot)
B: Poke check/trip/switch to closest man (hold B to switch to goalie in manual control)
C + D-Pad: Speed burst
Pad: Controls skating direction

Hints:

- Hidden teams -
Hold A and B and C and Start at the same time at the game menu screen until the team selection menu appears. The EA Sports and THQ Inc. teams may now selectable. 

- Play with man advantage -
This code only works when you play against the computer, and they only have 2 active goalies. First, you must injure the opponents starting goalie. This works best by running into him many times. It would be helpful to turn penalties off, so you don't get called for interference. Once he is injured, score enough goals for the computer to switch goalies. When this happens, one of their defensemen will be the goalie, but he won't be replaced. The game still treats this as even strength, so icing still applies.

    <desc>Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a championship had finally come good. The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices - pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

    <desc>This version is an extremely loose translation of the original arcade game, and not a particularly good one. Like all side-scrolling beat-em-ups, it requires a lot of repetition and button-pounding in order to succeed.

This one was actually news to me until very recently. It was never released in the U.S., but oddly enough, almost all of the in-game text is (extremely bad) English.

The plot is completely different from the original NES game, and Ryu is a less likable character. He's been sent by his ninja master to America in order to hunt down a fellow ninja who has betrayed his clan and stolen the "Secret Scroll of Huma" (or Homa, depending on the given moment in the game).

Not much of a plot, and not really much of a game. Much like the original arcade game, it gets tedious and boring rather quickly. The arcade game, however, had cool moves like the Phoenix Backflip and the ability to hang from overhead bars and swing. Ninja Gaiden for the Genesis offers no such respite from the tedium. The graphics are passable for the less-than-spectacular capabilities of the Genesis. There were several other games which had much better graphics and gameplay.

This one probably stayed in Japan for a reason... worth a play or two if you can find it, but not worth any significant amount of money. If you're looking for a good beat-em-up on the Genesis, go get a Streets of Rage game.

    <desc>When Japanese leader Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa fell from power in 1467, it basically left Japan without a central government. This lead to a war amongst Japanese fiefs (states). Each fief was ruled by a powerful lord called a daimyo. Each daimyo believed he was the most qualified to be the new Shogun. The war lasted for more than 100 years. Nobunaga's Ambition is based on these events. As a daimyo in this Warring States Period of Japan, it is your job to unify all the fiefs into one sovereign nation. In the first scenario, you must unify central Japan, which is composed of 17 fiefs. In the other three scenarios, the Japanese nation is divided into 50 fiefs, all of which must be conquered.

After you have created a name for you daimyo and chosen your home base, it's time to get to work. Prior to setting out to conquer other territories, you should fortify your home base. This involves cultivating your land, protecting it against floods, and winning the approval of your people. To gain loyalty amongst your population, you should pay your people from the gold you collect from your rice crops. You should also use your gold to hire soldiers.

Other factors important to winning the war include the age, health, drive, luck, charm, and intelligence of your daimyo. Among the ways you can add or subtract to these attributes are by winning battles, conducting successful negotiations, and by earning the loyalty of your people. Fief conditions also apply. You must ensure that your fief has an ample supply of gold, rice, productivity, wealth, men, morale, skill, and arms.

When confronting the surrounding fiefs, you can send a ninja to spy on them, attack them outright, or sign a non-aggression pact. Other things you can do in this game include marrying another daimyo's daughter, bribing rival fief's peasants, borrowing money, deploying troops, and staving off peasant uprisings. The game is over when your daimyo dies from illness, old age, or battle wounds.

    <desc>Based on the 1994 film of the same name (which starred Ray Liotta), No Escape drops you smack dab in the middle of Absolom Island, a multi-complex penitentiary known for its life sentences and the short life expectancy of its inmates. It seems you murdered your commanding military officer while you were in a dream-induced fit of rage.

You have heard through the grapevine that there is a place on the island called the village. The village is where the civilized inmates live. You want to go there at all costs, because it is your only hope for escape.

You begin the game in the thick of the jungle with nothing more than the clothes on your back and your years of combat training. You must run fast and avoid as many hazards (falling bags of sand, bursts of hot steam, spears in the ground, tree limbs and the like) as you can along the way. While you are on the run, Tree Dwellers, Techno Warriors and other prison thugs will come after you with darts, blowguns, knives and other weapons. Fight them off and avoid their fists and weapons. 

Throughout the game there are more than 150 objects for you to find, including an engine distributor, a hacksaw, tin snips, a rusty compass, shafts of wood, bolts, butane gas, an empty butane lantern, bulbs and an iron crowbar. Many of the objects can be combined to create new weapons and tools, such as a crossbow, sticks of dynamite or woodwork tools. 

A mapping system lets you enter the next destination you would like to explore. The village is a temporary safe haven where you can gain information and trade for new objects. The other four locations are filled with traps and enemies. Each of the sectors has multiple sub-sections to explore. Only when you have successfully completed a sub-sector can you move onto the next sub-sector in that area.

Trivia:

Released in 1994, the action/prison film No Escape starred Ray Liotta and Lance Henriksen.

    <desc>As a highly respected warrior, you are attempting to conquer as many regions as possible. This is a three-stage task, as first you must fight through hordes of fighters simply to reach the castle, and then you have to climb the various sections of the castle, before battling with its existing inhabitant.

The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately throughout the game, and must both be kept high.

Hints:

- End Password -
Enter the following code at the Password Screen: 0000 - 0000 - 00
Then you should have all but the last territory conquered.

    <desc>The Ooze is a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game created by STI in 1995.

The Ooze is based on an algorithmically-generated cellular automaton. As such, the main character can be split apart and reformed like a viscous liquid. The gameplay is reminiscent of The Bitmap Brothers' game The Chaos Engine (called Soldiers of Fortune in the US). The art style evokes a cartoony (necessitated by the constraints of the medium) H.R. Giger. The story recalls The Toxic Avenger.

The development team included people who later worked for Blizzard North on Diablo and Diablo II, including designer Stieg Hedlund. Some of the programming was fairly advanced for a 16-bit system; for example, the speed powerup effect was actually created by decreasing the viscosity of the character.</desc>

    <desc>One day, Osomatsu's five brothers went missing. The mischievous Iyami, of course, must be behind this! With great haste, Osomatsu grabs his slingshot, and sets out to rescue his brothers and give Iyami a taste of his own medicine.

Osomatsu-kun: Hachamecha Gekijou (Nonsense Theater) is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga and anime created by Fujio Akatsuka, which plays similarly to Alex Kidd. The player controls the titular Osomatsu through outlandishly Japanese environments, fighting bizarre enemies, collecting ribbons to buy various items from hidden shops, and searching for his missing brothers. Each stage is made up of multiple areas; falling into holes in the ground leads to underground passages, and jumping onto flying shells leads up into the clouds. A boss waits at the end of each stage, usually just Iyami in some sort of strange disguise.

    <desc>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

Gameplay:

The Ottifants is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through six worlds: starting with the house, the basement and the garden through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. In addition to this, enemies can be destroyed by stomping on them. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies and blasting enemies is not the only way to gain points. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the six worlds. By successfully completing a secret room, the player receives a 1,000 point bonus. Finding all jelly babies in a stage is rewarded with 100 extra points.

    <desc>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.

The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.

Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.

    <desc>As you wheel your speedy Ferrari along winding roads, huge bolts of lightning arc brilliantly across the sky. You put your lead foot all the way to the floor, and your car moves effortlessly across the slick highway. Slowing down for the turn, you skid into the parking lot of the lab. You are Lester Knight Chaykin, cool scientist extraordinaire.

After passing the standard series of entry tests, you are given the high level of clearance necessary for entry into the lab. With a loud sigh, you collapse into the comfortable plush computer chair and flick on your trusty computer. Opening a can of soda, you take a huge gulp as the machine loads up. With the swiftness that only years of experience can bring, you type in commands and begin the nuclear experiment. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning surges into the lab and collides with your experiment, winking you out of existence.

Seconds later you find yourself sitting in your chair, submerged in a pool of water. You feverishly swim toward the surface as tentacles (!) reach up for you. After a narrow escape, you climb out of the water and look around. You are greeted by an entirely new environment, one of strange animals gone mad. A blood-curdling howl cuts through the silence, and you scramble to your feet. Where are you? You are out of this world.

The action in Out of This World for the Genesis will have you walking, kicking, swinging, ducking, running, jumping, shooting and battling your way through the strange new world in order to get back home. Elevators and transporters can be used to reach different locations of the game. You must solve a variety of puzzles and avoid a number of pitfalls and traps along the way.

Trivia:

The original Out of this World game was released to the PC in 1990. The Genesis version is a straightforward port.

Out of this World was one of the last commercially released games for the Apple IIgs. The port was written by Bill Heineman, who also was responsible for the SNES version (both the IIgs and the SNES share the same main processor). If the screen size was reduced, the game ran extremely smoothly on a stock unaccelerated IIgs.

Controls:

A Button: Kick, fire gun
B Button: Hold down to run
C Button: Jump

    <desc>Out Run 2019 is a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis-only pseudo-sequel to Out Run that takes place in the future. The object is to race against time in a rocket-powered car (with a maximum speed of 682 mph) across five different stages around the world. Like the original Out Run, there is a fork in the road before each checkpoint; however, there can also be forks within a single route.

Out Run 2019 featured four different stages to race across, each one harder than the last. Like in Out Run, at the end of every route, there will be a diverge between the next two routes. Also, throughout most of the stages, some routes will diverge, splitting into two different roadways. Usually, some of the roads will lead onto a bridge over ground, and in some cases, over water. Slipping off the bridges will cost the player precious time.

Sometimes, when the roads split, they will lead to a different kind of road. This is usually seen by means of a three-way diverge sign, which means the player can choose whether to go left, right, or continue forward. For example, on one route in Stage 4, some parts of the road are covered in wet cement. Another features the player driving into a tunnel. The last will lead the player over a bridge.

Finally, there are also secret diverges that can be spotted easily. For example, some areas will have a ramp placed strategically on one side of the road. If hit correctly, the car will fly to one side, and eventually land on a secret roadway. Also, jumping off these ramps can also lead up to overhead bridges on some routes. These secret roads can usually lead to a quicker way to the next route.

Trivia:

Out Run 2019 was originally being developed for the Mega CD/Sega CD as Cyber Road. Development was later moved to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, where it was renamed Junker's High before eventually becoming Out Run 2019. In 2005, Out Run 2019 was re-released as a TV Games device - Play TV Legends Outrun 2019 from Radica Games. One notable thing about it was the included steering wheel controller.

    <desc>OutRunners is a sequel to the classic arcade racer OutRun. It puts you behind the wheel of 8 different race cars with the aim being coming up first on a world-wide cross-country racing tournament.

As mentioned you get to select from 8 differently tuned cars, each with different handling and speed specs. and then ride out in hopes of getting the trophy. At the end of each stage you get to select between different branching routes that determine what your next stage will be, and thus the different routes you take to the end game determine what ending you get (if you manage to beat the other players).

OutRunners places a big emphasis on competitive gameplay as you are always racing against another car, be it an AI or human-controlled one in a perpetual split-screen multiplayer mode.

Trivia:

The arcade original featured up to 8 simultaneous racers by linking four 2-seater cabinets.

Hints:

- Play as the Virtua Formula -
One the title screen, take controller one and enter this code: LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, C, A. You'll hear a noise if it worked. Press START and choose the Arcade Mode with button C. To the left of the first car is the Virtua Formula. Wait for the pictures and stats of the cars and you'll eventually see the Virtua Formula Car. (Note: This trick works on an early version of the game. It may or may not work the same on later versions.)

    <desc>OutRun is an arcade game developed by Sega AM2 in 1986 for specially designed hardware. It was designed by Yu Suzuki, and is often considered a milestone in the driving/racing genre, being ported to numerous home playforms and inspiring several sequels. Rather than be classed as a "racing game", Yu Suzuki classifies OutRun as a "driving game".

OutRun was a pioneer in video game graphics, audio and arcade cabinet design, picking up multiple awards during the late 1980s. It was the best selling arcade game of 1986 with over 20,000 cabinets sold worldwide.</desc>

    <desc>A combination of Pac-Man and Tetris, Pac-Attack mixes the ghost-gobbling action of the former with the falling block puzzle aspects of the latter. Your job is to maneuver the blocks into lines so they will vanish from the screen. Ghosts also fall from the top of the playfield, getting in the way of the solid lines you are trying to form. Luckily, Pac-Man accompanies the falling blocks from time to time, allowing you to maneuver him into a position to munch the ghosts. 

Similar to Tetris, the Normal mode of play in Pac-Attack continues until the blocks and/or ghosts have stacked up to the top of the playfield. Each ghost Pac-Man eats adds a little gold to the Fairy Meter. When the meter is full, a fairy jumps onto the screen and throws a gold dust spell, effectively removing all the ghosts below it. The 2 Player VS Game features head-to-head, split screen action. Here the winner is the player who lasts the longest in two out of three rounds.

Gameplay:

In the Puzzle game you complete a level when you have gotten Pac-Man to eat all of the ghosts. If all of the ghosts have not been eaten after a certain number of blocks and ghosts have fallen from the top of the screen, you lose. You can retry each of the 100 levels again and again, and a password feature lets you save your progress.

Hints:

Enter password JFK, and you get the game ending as well as the credits.

    <desc>Although it doesn't offer anything spectacular in the way of graphics or sounds (the music is downright silly for a war game), P.T.O. (Pacific Theater of Operations) is a satisfyingly realistic simulation that lets players act as Supreme Commander in WWII of either the Japanese or Allied Forces. The turn-based action, which relies heavily on tactical maneuvering and strategic command decisions, involves planning attacks, launching air strikes, managing a budget, implementing a draft, and much, much more. The game boasts a sophisticated mapping system for plotting your course, 250 ships based on those that fought during the war, and nine historical scenarios, including the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway.

    <desc>Everyone's favorite yellow chomping circle of a being is back and upgraded in Pac-Mania. Just as in the 1980 classic, you control Pac-Man through a maze as he attempts to gobble up all of the onscreen pellets before a ghost captures him. 

As one might expect from a sequel released seven years after the original, there are several new features in Pac-Mania. Right away you'll notice that what once was a 2D maze with 2D characters is now 3D in both respects with a diagonal tilt. Also, you now have the ability to jump over the ghosts in your way, some of whom will tail you ruthlessly.

The cast of ghosts includes those from Pac-Man and 1982's Ms. Pac-Man -- Clyde, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Sue -- as well as Funky, a new character blessed with the ability to jump like Pac-Man. Instead of just four ghosts as in the orignial, expect up to six of them onscreen at once, each with his or her own personality.

If things get too hairy, keep in mind that each corner of the maze houses a power pellet that will enable you to turn the ghosts into your next tasty treat. Its effects only last a few seconds, though, so make the best of this time. Other delectable edibles include green power pellets (speed boost), red power pellets (double points) and fruit (extra points).

Once all pellets in a level are devoured, you'll move on to the next, harder one. But if you trust your skills, you have the option of starting as high in the game as round four.

    <desc>Caught in a violent storm, Richard Tyler crashes his bicycle into a tree, leaving him dazed and confused. He shrugs off the wreck and goes to the nearest building which happens to be the library. But this is no ordinary library. This library is a world of horror, fantasy, and adventure, crawling with animated characters derived from the many stories contained in the books lying and flying about. The librarian, a mysterious man called The Pagemaster, informs Richard that in order to return to the outside world of reality, he must find the library exit.

As Richard Tyler you must run and jump your way through 68 levels of bats, ghosts, pirates, skeletons, fire creatures, and other nasties from the world of literature. In addition to jumping on top of and over your enemies, you'll find weapons such as gooey eyeballs, a pirate's sword, and magic dust. To help you in your quest through the magic library, you'll find magic shoes for jumping power, sticky hands for enhanced climbing ability, helmets for temporary invincibility, skulls for extra height, and of course books, which can you can arrange as you like. At the end of each level, a 3D bonus flying game puts you in the air collecting gold tokens (100 gives you an extra life) and magic dust.

    <desc>The fairy kingdom has long been threatened by the dark witch Wool, the leader of the Dark Undulation. The queen Velvet sent the cute little fairy Silk to seek aid by the red-haired witch Cotton, the only one who could defeat Wool. Cotton agrees under one condition: she will receive some willows as a reward, since willows are her favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, she begins to chase the mysterious enemy.

"Panorama Cotton" is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter reminiscent of Space Harrier, set in an anim?-style fantasy world. Various levels scroll "into the screen", vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can move Cotton over the screen, shooting at oncoming enemies and avoiding obstacles on her way. Cotton can upgrade her weapon to higher levels as you advance in the game, and can also cast magical spells by collecting special items.

    <desc>Who ever said that being a paperboy was an easy job? In Paperboy 2, find out just how hard it can be! As either a paperboy or a papergirl, your objective is to avoid the obstacles that come with the job of delivering papers as you toss them to subscibers' houses. Failing to get the papers to these houses will result in their cancelling their subscriptions and you possibly losing your job. At the end of your route is a bonus round where you can rack up some extra points. Extra points can also be attained by accurate throws, breaking non-subscribers' windows, stopping burglars and runaway baby strollers, and watering sunbathers.

    <desc>In Paperboy your job is to ride your bicycle through the neighborhood, throwing newspapers into subscribers' mailboxes or onto their front porches. If you miss one of the target homes, that particular household will drop their subscription. Vengeful paperboy that you are, you can break the windows of nonsubscribers' houses for extra points.

The life of a paperboy in this game is tougher than you might think as the neighborhood is probably a little different than your own. While delivering papers, you will be assaulted by lawn mowers, tornadoes, workmen, breakdancers, dogs, and even the Grim Reaper. You can avoid these enemies or throw papers at them for extra points. There are also obstacles you must deal with such as trees, tires, grates, fire hydrants, fences, garbage cans, and man holes. And if that's not enough, cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles cruise recklessly down the street, hoping to run over you. After you finish each day of your daily route, you will enter a training course. In this timed bonus round, you must avoid obstacles, jump ramps, and throw newspapers at targets.

    <desc>The first hoops game to appear on the Genesis, Pat Riley Basketball features two modes of play: Exhibition and Tournament. You can choose from three game times (20-minute, 48-minute and 80-minute), two game speeds (Normal and Slow) and two types of defense (Man to Man and Zone).

Due to the lack of an NBA license, no real players appear in the game. Instead, there are eight generic teams (such as the Los Angeles Hoops and the Dallas Wings) with five faux players on each team. Players are rated according to speed, shooting accuracy, passing ability and defensive skill. 

Stats are kept for points scored, shots taken and fouls committed. In addition to fouls, there are numerous infractions you can commit. These include out of bounds, traveling, over and back, 5-second violation, 10-second violation, and 24-second violation. There are no substitutions in the game (therefore no foul-outs), but you can switch the positions of your players as needed.

During slam-dunks, free throws and three-pointers, the camera angle switches to a graphically enhanced close-up of the action. To sink a free throw or dunk, you must accurately stop a ball that moves on a meter bar. On defense, you can block shots (including dunks) and steal the ball.

Trivia:

This game borrows heavily from Double Dribble (1987) for the NES. Pat Riley has coached for the Los Angeles Lakers (where he won four NBA titles), the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. When not coaching, he is a highly paid motivational speaker.

Controls:

D-Pad: Move player with ball or signal direction of pass attempt when on offense, move player marked with arrow when on defense
Start: Pause/unpause
A: Call time out during dead-ball situations, select players in position-charge situations
B: Shoot or dunk ball, attempt to block dunk shots, move control arrow to player nearest ball when on defense
C: Pass ball to teammate, throw ball in from out of bounds, steal ball from opposing player in mid-dribble
A, B, or C: Tap ball in center-court tip-off before each quarter

    <desc>Now you can golf on one of the most famous courses in the world with Pebble Beach Golf Links for the Genesis. Licensed by the Pebble Beach Company, the game features 18 holes of fairways, greens, bunkers, cliffs, water traps (including the ocean!), sand traps and other staples of professional golf. 

Five gameplay options are available: Practice, Skins Game, Stroke Play, Match Play, and Tournament Play vs. 48 Top Golfers. You can create up to ten players and change the names of the fictional pros to anything you want. A battery backup saves stats, such as tournament scores, longest drives, putts per round and much more.

You can choose from 14 different golf clubs. If you need advice, you can rely on your caddy to suggest the club with the most appropriate range. A power meter lets you hit the ball at the desired strength and height, and along with your stance, determines whether you will hit the ball straight, to the right or to the left. Wind speed and direction and the lie of the ball are also things that you should consider when preparing to hit the ball. 

Other features in this game include instant replays, a leaderboard, green grids (for help in aiming putts), hole fly-bys, and multiple camera angles.

Trivia:

Pebble Beach has been rated as the number one rated public golf course in America. It was the site of the 1992 U.S. Open.
Golf videogames have been popular since Golf hit the Atari 2600 in 1980.

    <desc>The Europe-only sequel to Pete Sampras Tennis, Pete Sampras Tennis '96 includes new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joins the previously available Grass, Clay and Hard courts. 

Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction. 

The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder). There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament ("Party mode" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).

    <desc>Pete Sampras Tennis offers a unique way to play with four players without requiring an adaptor: the game has two input plugs at the top! This device is called a J-Cart, which is the first cartridge to include support for two additional joysticks or gamepads.

Besides letting you play with up to four players, the game offers four modes of tennis: Challenge (one singles or doubles match), Tournament (four to eight players with byes), World Tour, where you'll play in 33 cities around the globe, and Tutorial, which explains all of the game's controls.

Pete Sampras Tennis also includes three court types (grass, hard and clay), 32 different computer players with individual skills and appearances, instant replay, and a continue option via passwords. Over 4,000 frames of animation will show dives, backhands, serves, runs, volleys and forehands, and an umpire will call the game as a crowd looks on.

    <desc>The 8-Meg PGA European Tour updates 1992's PGA Tour Golf II with five new courses, ten new professionals to play against, and an eight-player elimination tournament. These features go along with everything found in the previous Genesis PGA Tour game, including the horizontal swing gauge and draw and fade meter. The featured European Tour players are as follows: Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, J.M. Olazabal, Tony Johnstone, Ian Woosnam, Sandy Lyle, Rodger Davis, Ronan Rafferty, Colin Montgomerie and Constantino Rocca.

Players can participate in a Practice Round, 72-hole Tournament (against an additional fifty European roster players), Skins Challenge, Match Play, Shoot-Out, or work on their long or short game on either the Driving Range or Putting Green. As in PGA Tour Golf II, you can save your golfer to battery along with statistics such as earnings (in pounds), average, Best 18, Best 72 and number of wins. Curious about the European courses? Players can compete at the Wentworth Club, Forest of Arden, Crans-sur-Sierre, Le Golf National and Valderrama.

    <desc>PGA Tour 96 represents a significant departure from previous games in Electronic Arts's popular Genesis golf series. The links are now modeled in 3D, allowing for visible slopes and varied terrain instead of the straight, flat courses in earlier titles. A new swing meter replaces the tried-and-true horizontal bar, appearing as a blue arc just behind your digitized golfer.

Once you press the button to begin the shot, a line will move up along the arc simulating the natural motion of a backswing: hit the button again to determine power and once more for accuracy. If you don't time the swing correctly, you'll either hook or slice the ball depending on where the line falls on the arc.

The three authentic courses include the TPC at River Highlands, TPC at Sawgrass and Spyglass Hill GC. Players can create their own golfers or elect to play as or against one of ten different PGA Tour pros (with statistics based on the 1994 season): Brad Faxon, Fuzzy Zoeller, Craig Stadler, Jeff Sluman, Mark O'Meara, Davis Love III, Bruce Lietzke, Tom Kite, Lee Janzen and Peter Jacobsen.

The five play modes consist of Tournament (against 56 additional roster players), Match Play, Skins, EA Shoot-Out and Practice. Those who would rather get a feel for the swing meter can also "visit" a Driving Range or Putting Green to work out the kinks. Rounding out the package is battery backup to record statistics (both individual and course), tournament progress and created golfers.

    <desc>In PGA Tour Golf III for the Sega Genesis, you can choose from these Tournament Players Club courses: Summerlin, Sawgrass, Avenel, Scottsdale, Southwind, River Highlands, Las Colinas, and Woodlands. Prior to entering a tournament, where you must compete for cash against 60 professional golfers and up to three friends, you can hone your skills in the practice round, the driving range, or the putting green. Tournament play includes a Skins Challenge, Match Play, and the EA Sports Shoot-Out, which is a three-hole elimination contest.

When you are getting ready to hit the ball, you must decide if you want to hook or slice the ball or if you want to hit it straight, depending on the lie of the ball, what obstacles are on the course, and what your follow up shot is going to be like. You must also decide what club to use, how much arc to put on the ball, how hard to hit the ball, and what effect the wind will have on the ball. When putting, you can look at a contour grid, which shows the topography of the putting surface.

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive Sega Net game entitled "Phantasy Star II: Anne's Adventure". It sports a variable-width font engine with kerning and, as usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English, depending on the country code of your machine.

Once, long ago, some folks who could both english and japanese realized something. The script for one of the greatest 16-bit RPGs of all-time had been butchered in its English translation. Which is quite a pity, to be sure. So some fellows going by Hirata and Zickefoose rectified it by tranaslating the game into English, and stick it in a text file somewhere. Then Naflign steps in. He adored Phantasy 2 (as anyone in their right mind SHOULD), and set about hacking this script into the game. And guess what?! He met with success. So now, you can enjoy Phantasy Star 2 in it's proper english glory.

    <name>Phantasy Star III: Generation Of Doom</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>It's the day of your wedding, and everyone is very excited, not the least of which is you. You're marrying Maia, the mysterious woman found on the shores of your father's kingdom. Suddenly, a giant dragon swoops into the hall and takes flight with your fiancee! 

Being the noble prince, you give chase to rescue your beloved. Here starts your journey into the savage worlds of Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom. Starting as Prince Rhys, you must battle your way to save your beloved through seven different worlds, and uncover a conspiracy far worse than you ever expected.

Spanning seven worlds, and three generations, you must find and confront this evil. At the end of each generation, choose who you'll marry, and in turn get a different quest. It's up to you to save the world, you and your following generations. Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom contains four different endings for added replay value, and numerous quests and challenges.

Hints:

- Improve late-game character stats -

A glitch in the game will allow you to make either Laya or Kara always act first in battle and be immune to physical attacks, as well as moderately improve the speed and defense of the rest of the party.

The glitch is activated in Skyhaven, when changing the Legendary weapons into Nei weapons.

1. Decide who you want to always act first and be immune to physical attacks - Laya or Kara.

2. Remove all items from that person. 

3. Make sure everyone else has their appropriate Legendary weapon equipped (Orakio Sword, Miun Claw, Siren Shot, Laya Bow, Lune Slicer).

4. Speak to the second from the left old man, who says "Nei is the word of ultimate power".

5. Check your status screens. For the person who had no equipment, attack and defense should be in the 64,000 range, and speed in the 220 range. For the others, the attack, defense, and speed bonuses of the Legendary weapon they had equipped will be permenantly added to their base stats. (Unfortunately, none of the increases to the attack statistic have effect on damage dealt in battle).

The only way the person with 64,000 defense will be hurt is from a Gnasher (who will do a whopping 4 damage) or from techniques (which are unaffected). She will always act first.

There are 3 side effects which may appear alarming but are in fact harmless.

1. Colours will be unusual - this will be corrected once you check your menu and leave Skyhaven

2. Last person in line will be shifted out of place - this will be corrected once you leave Skyhaven, and the out-of-line person will not prevent you from moving

3. Characters will be renamed - this is permanent but harmless.

- Skip Nial's Generation -

An escapipe glitch allows players to skip over Nial's generation directly to playing Aron. Aron will need to do some of Nial's quest, but it goes much faster and easier with Aron, thanks to his healing and access to the Aero Parts.

1. As Rhys, before fighting the king of Cille, make sure Wren or Mieu has an escape pipe.

2. After defeating the king, select Nial's route by marrying Lena. (Do not choose Maia as the glitch does not work for Ayn.)

3. As soon as the cinema is over and you can move, go into your menu and use an escapipe.

4. As Nial, you will warp back to Cille dungeon. Walk through it again (you will encounter only Chirpers). The king and Maia are waiting in the same place as for Rhys, defeat him once more (an easy task with full HP/TP and a stronger leader). 

5. Select Aron's route by marrying Alair. (Do not choose Laya because Adan will be unable to complete his quest.)

At this point you play as Aron. The Sub Parts, Laya Pendant, Twins Ruby, and Mystery Star that Aron come with are "fakes" that do not work, so Aron will need to collect the real ones as Nial would have.

6. Collect the Aero Parts as normal.

7. Fly to the rebel hideout and pick up the Sub Parts.

8. Go to Hazatak using the caves to Landen, Aquatica, then Aridia.

9. Get Laya as normal.

10. Go to Mystoke and get the Laya pendant.

From this point on finish the game as normal

Full English release in typical MIJET fashion. That means, VWF, dual language support by region, and top quality work. No known issues. A patcher program is available on the author's website if you prefer it over the typical IPS patching solution.

Update:

A major overhaul of what some critics are calling "the Blade Runner of very short text adventures."

    <desc>This is a thorough alteration of Phantasy Star II for the Sega Genesis that changes nearly every facet of the game. It slightly lowers the difficulty from the notoriously difficult original, it now ties-in better with the rest of the classic Phantasy Star series, with a completely rewritten story, and the great surprise veterans have wanted for over a decade! So newcomers and veterans alike, come enjoy the Numan Revolution! Features:

- Every piece of equipment has had some alteration done to it, from a different strength or opened to use by new characters. There are even many new ones!

- All the characters learn more Techniques.

- The guns have been given major improvements to be better than many bladed weapons and some award defensive bonuses.

- An all-new storyline!

- Every shop inventory has been changed.

- All the enemies give double Experience and double Meseta in comparison to the originals to speed the pace of the game.

- Each character levels up at a different rate, and the weaker ones get massive boosts from level 35 and up.

- Brand new monster sprites and a new enemy!

Description

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive Sega Net game entitled "Phantasy Star II: Shilka's Adventure". It sports a variable-width font engine with kerning and, as usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English, depending on the country code of your machine.

    <desc>In the dark, vast reaches of space, light years from the planet we call home, floats the Algo Star System. It contains three planets, and the middle one is a green, hospitable world called Mota, gripped in a web of insanity.

Phantasy Star II is a role-playing experience like no other. Featuring complex plot twists, numerous characters, and a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy elements. Join forces with Hugh the Biologist, Shir the Thief, Kain the Wrecker, Rudo the Hunter, and many others as you try to unravel the mystery of why Mother Brain has let the planet fall apart.

Controls:

Start Button: Pause; unpause
D-Pad: Move cursor, move player
A Button: Talk to townspeople, advance dialog box, inspect objects
B Button: Cancel command, close selection box
C Button: Open update box, open selection box, activate commonds in selection box

Hints:

- Become invisible -
In battle, get all of your team members KO-ed except for Nei. Then get Nei to cast Nasak and she should KO herself. Then, your characters will turn invisible and you can walk around dungeons freely. 
(This works in all version of PS2)

- Make the game scroll one frame at a time. -
When paused, press C and one frame should go by.

- Slow motion play -
When paused, press and hold B and play as normal. The game should play very slow.

- Switch game music -
This trick allows you to have different music play in other areas, using the slow motion code. First, you go to the area that has the music you want, like the weapons shop for instance. Next, press start and hold B. The game will move in slow motion with no sound, so you can still move. Now, then go to another place and let go of B, then press Start. The music from the place where you first pressed B and Start now plays in this area! Cool glitch!

- Equip armor glitch -
It is possible to have armor equipped even if it is not in your possession. First make sure you have at least two pieces of armor in a characters possession.
1. Go to the equip screen and highlight the armor you want to keep equipped.
2. This is the tricky part...equip/unequip the armor...when it says ".....takes armor" press a confirm button and then QUICKLY press down to the next armor below it and equip/unequip that armor. You need to do it
fast enough so that you see only a little change in the attack,defense, and/or agility from changing equipment.
3. You'll know if the glitch worked because you won't be able to unequip the first piece of armor. Now you can give the armor to another character! Who says you can't have powerful equipment like the NEIMET on just one character?
To cancel the glitch, simply equip another piece of armor over the affected armor slot.
It may take a few tries to get the glitch working because the equipping/unequipping must be done very quickly.

- No random encounters -
When examining the nearby area with the A (Talk, Examine) button, the next step you take is guaranteed not to take you into a battle. Keep hitting the A button (Talk, Examine) while you walk, so that after every step it will say ''There seems to be nothing unusual here.'' No random encounters will happen, but it will take quite a while to maneuver through dungeons this way.

    <desc>PSIV Arranged Version is a slightly more difficult version of PSIV. The main differences include a significantly slower EXP/MST gain in addition to new item and weapon uses. The goal of this romhack is not to force the player to grind for more levels and cash, but simply to force him or her to examine dozens of options that the game makes available to the player that may have otherwise been overlooked in a normal playthrough.

    <desc>When the central computer system of Palma, Mother Brain, exploded 2000 years ago, the planet was destroyed. Other planets under the control of Mother Brain were affected as well, including Motavia, home of Chaz the Hunter. The deterioration of Motavia most notably included the creation of horrendous Bio-Monsters. As Phantasy Star IV begins, Chaz is not aware that it is in his destiny to not only stop these monsters -- but also to save the galaxy.

Though Chaz is the game's main character, he is by no means the only one. Many characters are under your control in the game, up to four at a time in a single party. Your quest involves performing many tasks for people in various Motavian towns (and other planets later), learning more about a much larger quest as you go along. There are several comic book-like cut scenes that evolve the game's story (along with a fair share of plot twists). As the game progresses, the party will encounter countless enemies, helping them to gain experience and thus become more effective warriors. Chaz's specialty is with blades, but the eclectic abilities of the other characters will enable you to use powerful magic and other weapons as well.

Controls:

D-Pad: Move characters
Start Button: System menu
A Button: Camp menu
B Button: Cancel selection
C Button: Search area, open containers and doors, talk

Hints:

- Music Test -
Complete the game, and then press B at the ''Start/Continue/Erase'' screen.

- Level 99 Glitch -
If you ever happen to get a character to reach level 99, this odd glitch will occur. Instead of putting a level cap, when you reach level 99 all of your characters will be leveled down to around 40~50. And everytime you should go up a level, your character will go down another level. Although your stats screen will still say you are level 99.

    <desc>Rebecca Madison is lurking somewhere in Metropia. This is a problem. She is bent on taking over the world, as so many evil characters are, but this time she has the resources to do it. Rebecca is head of Maximum Incorporated, a business specializing in biotechnology; a business specializing in death. As Kit Walker, aka the Phantom, you must traverse over 60 levels spanning the city of Metropia to stop her.

A map screen will let you choose a sector you want to explore, but don't expect a safe trip. Armies of biots are programmed to attack you! The Phantom can scale walls and swing from ceilings with his inductance rope, fire homing missiles from his smart gun, and even drop special pellets that explode on contact.

There are 14 weapons and five items in total, and you have the ability to control two weapons at a time. An inventory screen allows you to store all of the items and weapons collected for later use. Phantom 2040 also features 20 possible endings based on your performance during the game.

Trivia:

"Phantom 2040" is based on the cartoon series of the same name, which was an early Batman Beyond-like adaptation of the classic Phantom character set in the future.

Created by the legendary Lee Falk and first appearing in february 17th, 1936, The Phantom started his many adventures to rid the world from piracy and evildoers following the footsteps of his ancient lineage as the 21st "Walking Phantom" in the world. In practically no time Falk's newest creation rose to world fame under the King Features Syndicate banner, which placed it in tons of newspapers around the world (Falk was already a major-league player from his earlier success: Mandrake the Magician, and thus commanded true star treatment from his publishers) and remains to this day a well-known classic of comic book history. 

The character also made the leap out of the comic books many times, with a collection of 15 serials in 1943 from Columbia Pictures, an animated series in 1986 (along Flash Gordon and Mandrake) as well as a motion picture starring Billy Zane in 1996 by Paramount (besides the aforementioned Phantom 2040 animated series which had the particularity of being helmed by Peter Chung of Aeon Flux fame). So far this is the only videogame adaptation of the long-running franchise.

    <desc>Television is no longer enough for Pink Panther; he wants to be a Hollywood movie star. During his first audition, the Pinkster manages to spoil a scene starring the famous Inspector Clouseau. Feeling like his chances at stardom are ruined, the inspector seeks revenge. He chases Pink Panther through the various back lots of Hollywood studios, wrecking the sites of such movies as Pinkenstein, Pink Beard and Cat on a Hot Pink Roof. While running scared through the movie sets, Pink Panther must dodge or kill everything from rats to dinosaurs to animated cowboy boots. Luckily, he's armed to the teeth. His arsenal includes a detonator, a fly swatter, a sledgehammer, a can of bug spray and other useful weapons. Also, he can jump on the various critters to get rid of them. To assist Pink Panther in his getaway, toll gates are available. When Pink Panther drops a coin in the toll gate, he gains access to another level or platform.

The game offers you the chance to play the role of a pirate in six different game scenarios or careers, each beginning with a different time period in history.

Choose from the following: 1560s' The Silver Empire, 1600s' Merchants and Smugglers, 1620s' The New Colonists, 1640s' War for Profit, 1660s' The Buccaneer Heroes, or 1680s' The Pirates' Sunset. You can also select your nationality, difficulty level and one of five special abilities your character will possess, including fencing, navigation, gunnery, medicine, or wit and charm.

After typing in your family name, you'll have to first win a duel on board a ship before you can start sailing from an overhead view of the Spanish Main. You're then left to your own devices on how to play the game. Earn titles by fighting for kings of different nations, battle ports, attack and acquire bigger ships, hire crew members, sell goods or even search for buried treasure.

Besides starting a new career, you can assume command of one of six famous expeditions, practice sword fighting or view the Hall of Fame of top pirates. Up to four games can be saved to cartridge, so you can resume your buccaneering whenever you feel the urge to pillage and plunder. Just make sure you have enough rations to last your trip and gold to divide among your crew!

    <desc>Developed for both Genesis and Super NES, this colorful combat game from Sunsoft is based on the Saturday morning cartoon show of the same title, created by David Kirschner. Each of the three main heroes from the animated series is playable: Ren, the beleaguered prince of Octopon; Tula, the supernaturally gifted "Ecomancer"; and Ioz, the battle-hardened former pirate. In the roles of these characters, players fight against the villain Bloth and his nefarious brigands as they side-scroll through eight stages of combat and action, in search of the Treasures of Rule. As in earlier 2D combat games, such as Double Dragon or Final Fight, two gamers can play at once on the same screen.

    <desc>Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a side-scrolling action game in which you play adventurer Pitfall Harry Jr in search of his father Pitfall Harry. You battle your way through the Mayan jungles, waterfalls, deserted mines and can bungee jump and boomerang your way to safety. There are 13 levels and the action is fast and gripping. You will need to be attentive-and quick. Or prepare to die.

Trivia:

Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure utilized the initial release of DirectX and was one of the first PC games to be released as a native Windows 95 executable.
Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is based upon the groundbreaking Pitfall!, which Activision released to the Atari VCS in 1982.

    <desc>Pit-Fighter is a no-rules, unregulated fighting game which lets you control one of three digitized fighters: Buzz, a body builder and former pro wrestler; Ty, a kick-boxing Pit-Fighter veteran; and Kato, a speedy, very agile Karate expert. Each character has three super moves. In addition to fighting with fists and feet, weapons such as sticks, knives, crates, and garbage cans are available throughout the game. As you progress through the levels, you'll eventually face ten different fighters, each of them with unique abilities and fighting techniques. The fights take place in seven different areas: a warehouse, a garage, a subway station, a high-rise building, a bar, a freeway overpass, and a wharf. Like most fighting games, the one-player game is a series of one-on-one fights. The two-player simultaneous mode, however, differs from the norm in that instead of fighting each other, you and your gaming partner fight two of the bad guys. As the fights play out, a crowd of anxious spectators cheer. If you get too close to the audience, you get shoved back into the middle of the action.

    <desc>Take control of the title character or her little raccoon friend, Meeko, in this adventure based on Pocahontas, the Disney animated film from 1995. Pocahontas must learn the nine special animal spirits as she ventures out into the wilderness to prevent a war between her Powhatan tribe and the English settlers. The game is separated into three acts and takes place in the forest, at the long house of Chief Powhatan, at an English settlement, inside a ship, and in various natural Virginian surroundings. 

When the game begins, Pocahontas can walk, climb, short jump and push objects, while Meeko can run, climb trees, jump, jump into Pocahontas' arms, push small objects and tread water. In order to gain special powers (such as night vision, swimming and sprinting), Pocahontas, with the help of Meeko, must free nine animal friends from various predicaments. Switch between the pair at any time and use each character's strengths to figure out how to reach the end of the level.

Various puzzles appear throughout each level as you explore your surroundings. For example, you cannot simply enter the front door of the long house, so you must find another way in. Ledges sometimes appear to be out of reach and some objects seem impossible to move. These and other puzzles await your gaming expertise. Players can resume progress by entering passwords awarded at the end of each level, and cinematic cut-scenes help further the story as the characters advance through the game.

Trivia:

Released to theaters in 1995, Pocahontas tells the story of a brave and free spirited woman who defied her tribe and her father (Chief Powhatan) by falling in love with an Englishman named John Smith. Voice actors for the film include Irene Bedard, Judy Kuhn and Mel Gibson.

    <desc>Arrggh no! Nintendo's annoying electric mouse and his mates make it onto the Genesis in this surprisingly enjoyable platform game, shocking...

The Hong Kong Pirates have obviously spent a lot of time on this one for a change, it has great graphics and above average level design, even if it does rely a little too heavily on leaps into the unknown. Features all the usual platform game elements and you can dispatch the other pok?mon by either jumping on their heads in the usual manner or by lobbing the pok?balls you find scattered around the levels at them. All the pok?mon are actually recognizable too although one or two do seem to have been "borrowed" from other games, the bunny for instance looks very much like it's been lifted straight from Mega Bomberman. They took the part about Picachu being a mouse a little too seriously though because when he turns to face you he sports the most amazing set of teeth, even Bugs Bunny would be jealous. You can bet if Nintendo know about this games existence that they're not very happy.

    <desc>Populous for the Sega Genesis gives you the power to completely control a world, bestowing you with the gift to control natural disasters like volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, and fires. You must also prepare lands for settlement and expansion. The larger the settlement, the more advanced it becomes.

With great power also comes great responsibility, so it's up to you to defeat the forces of evil in a showdown at the Armageddon. You command a group of loyal followers who obey your every whim. Send them into battle, or make them build a castle for defense. It's your decision. 

As you build strength and gain followers, your powers grow and so does your ability to crush the dark enemy. No one ever said being a god was easy, but Populous makes it possible to live out the ultimate supernatural fantasy. Five hundred worlds are yours for the conquering.

    <desc>In this game you take on the role of 1 out of 8 teams who represent various nations vying to become the Powerball champions. Powerball is a game consisting of a hybrid of sports such as American football, soccer and rugby. You play on an 100 yard field trying to score on the opposing team. Scoring consists of either running into your opponent's end zone holding the powerball for a touchdown or kicking the ball into your opponent's net to score a goal. Goals are worth 1 point, and touchdowns are worth 3 points. The game modes are 1 or 2 player exhibition play, and 1 or 2 player league play. League play allows you to use bonus points, and distribute them to your teammates to improve their statistics.

Hints:

- Extra Teams -
To gain access to four extra teams, press B, B, C, B, B, and C during the team display screen.

- Level Passwords -
Enter the following code at the Password Screen.... 
1st Championship: PUDCR 
2nd Championship: CMOPE 
Semi-Finals: BFOOE 
Finals: OADBR 
Then you should go to your desired level

- Sound Test -
Go to the ''League Continue Mode'' and choose China as your team. Now enter the password KWGEN and hit start. You'll now have a Sound Test option.

    <desc>Overview:

Power Drive is an arcade racing game based around rally driving. Handbrake turns and lurid powerslides are both possible, and the steering is suitably loose.

There are 3 types of stages - individual time-trials, head-to-head races against the computer, and some skill tests. There are 8 rounds of gameplay, set across countries ranging from Sweden to Kenya. You get prize money for winning races, and it costs money to repair damage.

    <desc>Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

Gameplay:

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game. Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.

Hints:

- Conquest Password -
Select the ''Restore Conquest'' option and enter the password 2MNOA2WSD. Now you should be able to select any of the 195 territories on the map.

- Last Level Password -

    <marquee/>
    <desc>In this game based on the 1990 movie starring Danny Glover, you play the role of Lieutenant Michael P. Harrigan as you investigate the strange murders in the city of Los Angeles. Adding to the difficulty is the ongoing war between Colombian and Jamaican gangs, not to mention reports of some peculiar creature hanging around the area...

Predator 2 is an angled overhead shooter consisting of seven levels. The first level has you blasting gang members while making your way through the urban streets trying to find nine hostages. After rescuing the downed officers, find the exit and you'll be taken to the rooftops to fight it out with armed helicopters and even more gang members. Rescue fourteen hostages and you'll be able to progress to the next level.

Subsequent levels all involve rescuing a certain number of hostages while fending off the repeated shots of rival gang members. You'll also have to deal with the invisible Predator, who will try to target you with its laser sights (resembling a red triangle). Keep moving to avoid it and you just might live long enough to see the next level!

The goal of the game is to eventually confront the creature(s) on board the alien ship. Yet in order to make it that far, you'll have to find the following equipment (Harrigan automatically carries a pistol with unlimited ammo): rifle, scatter gun, sawed-off shotgun, grenades, flak jackets (life meter increases to 100 percent) and first-aid kits (extra life and full health).

Before you are ready to confront an alien, you'll need to first acquire its weapons, including a spear, flying disk and net. As you might have guessed, ordinary guns or grenades cannot harm Predators. Three difficulty levels (normal, hard or easy) will determine how many lives you start with as well as the amount of damage you can take before dying. A password system lets you continue your pursuit of the Predator aliens through seven hostage-filled stages.

    <desc>Premier Manager 97 is the second Mega Drive game in the hit football managing game series of the early nineties. Similar to the first run of games in the series (released between 1992 and 1994), the manager starts (in the Full Game mode) as a lowly division 3 (not Conference) manager, where the goal is to get the club to the top divisions, or get signed to better placed teams. In the Demo mode, the player can choose any Premier League team, but only for a season.

In either of the modes, the player is responsible for carefully assembling the team (and unlike other managers, selecting the appropriate tactics is crucial to win the game), get the best from the transfer market by selling the fading stars and outselling the biggest clubs in England in the quest for the stars of the future, improve stadium capacity and quality (including seating, roof, security and others), sign good deals for ground advertising and balance the budget to make the team finish the season out of the red.

Matches are always simulated, with a ruler showing where the ball is, and with text messages showing actions (like "player passes", player tackles" and so on). The chances of goals are shown in LED-style animated clips.

    <desc>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.

    <desc>A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world.

Primal Rage is a one-on-one fighting game featuring dinosaurs and giant apes as the fighters. The graphics are done with digitized stop-motion animation. Gameplay is similar to Mortal Kombat in that it is viewed from a side perspective, and features deadly finishing moves at the end of the match.

Trivia:

There was going to be a sequel Primal Rage 2 but due to poor sales it got cancelled. However Atari felt it need a sequel in one form or another so the book written John Vornholt called Primal Rage: The Avatars was made instead of a second game.

    <desc>In this sequel to Sega's NFL '95, Prime Time NFL Football starring Deion Sanders increases the difficulty, expands stat tracking to over forty categories, and adds a record book that saves top individual and team performances around the league. 

These complement established features such as the NFL and NFLPA licenses, all thirty teams including Jacksonville and Carolina, star players such as Troy Aikman and Steve Young, as well as player stats based on the 1994 season.

Prime Time also allows you to create, sign or release players, toggle injuries, customize playbooks, choose weather conditions, relocate any team to any city, play multiple schedules, and save up to fifteen user records.

View the action from 65 yards down the field so you won't miss that single coverage on third and long. Make the plays as the quarterback or elect to become the receiver at the line of scrimmage. You've played the other games, but are you ready for Prime Time?

    <desc>In an hour the princess must decide: marry the Grand Vizier Jaffar or die. You are the only one who can save her, but you've been arrested and thrown in the dank dungeons far below the palace where the princess nervously waits in a room at the top of a tower. You escape the guards' clutches, but you have a long way to go to rescue your true love and depose the cruel tyrant who rules his land with an iron fist. To get there, you'll have to leap across bottomless chasms, avoid spikes which shoot up from the floor, and battle nasty swordsmen.

Played in real time, Prince of Persia gives you exactly one hour of game time to master its secrets and reach your objective. Using animation modelled after the movements of real people, creator Jordan Mechner has crafted an intriguing game which not only looks wonderful, it has the feel of an old adventure film, with you in the title role.

Controls:

D-Pad Left or Right: Turn around, run left or right.
A Button + D-Pad: Take careful steps, strike with sword.
B Button: Jump, block.
D-Pad Up: Jump up to ledge.

    <desc>Pro Quarterback is an arcade-style football game with a view just behind the quarterback, allowing you to see down the field without the use of passing windows. Choose between 26 professional caliber teams and challenge either the computer or a friend on one of six different field surfaces: grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf. Want to team up against the computer? Pro Quarterback also allows for cooperative play with one person playing QB and the other controlling the receiver. After the kickoff, select from seven plays on defense or up to eight plays on offense, which can be flipped to keep your opponent guessing. The game also has instant replay, adjustable quarters (2, 5, 10 or 15 minutes) and game statistics updated during halftime and at the end of the game. Gridiron fans take note: Pro Quarterback does not feature an NFL or NFLPA license to include real teams or players.

    <desc>Psycho Pinball is another pinball game in the style first introduced in Pinball Dreams and later popularized in Pinball Fantasies. Standard features of these types of pinball simulations include an animated backglass display, multiple bonuses including a multi-ball, extra ball, etc., and background music that changes based on active specials.

There are three main tables:

- The Abyss (Aquatic theme)
- Trick or Treat (Horror theme)
- Wild West (Western theme)

...but an additional gimmick is a fourth Psycho Pinball table (circus theme) that has bonuses that can launch you to the other three tables, leading to massively high scores (and very long gameplay times).

Hints:

- Extra ball -
To get an extra ball pause the game and press Down, B, C, B, Right, Right.

- Play mini games -

    <desc>Puggsy is a platform game with a combination of action and puzzle-solving elements. You control the the creature Puggsy, who has crash landed on an alien planet and had his spaceship stolen. Your goal is find the spaceship so you can get off the planet and return home. To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments. Throughout each level are a variety of objects which you can pick up; on many of the levels you will need to figure out how to use the objects available to you in order to reach the exit. Some objects can used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked. Of course, each level will also have a variety of bad guys wandering about which will cost Puggsy one of his lives if he's caught. On your quest there will also be six evil guardians which will need to be defeated before you get your spaceship back!

Trivia:

The Puggsy character originated in a series of demo animations made for the Amiga in the late 80s and early 90s. As you may gather from this, the game was originally planned for release several years earlier. In the animations Puggsy was silver rather than red; Nik Wild of Psygnosis claimed that the change was made to help people with black and white TVs.

Pulseman is an electric hero who was created to fight cyber crime. Combat the galaxy gang throughout 7 stages with around 50 levels. Pulseman is best described as a fusion between the gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man in ways of gameplay.

Translation Description:

As seems to be standard practice with MIJET's work, the patch contains both the original Japanese and the English translation. The correct translation is chosen based on the region of your Genesis or emulator internally thanks to some ROM Hack wizardry. Check the readme if you're interested in getting an inside look at the hacking from the author's perspective.

As for the translation itself, it's stellar work as usual. There wasn't much text in the game (the readme states a mere 22 strings), but it was all handled with tender loving care, which shows brilliantly. Strangely enough, there is some spoken English in the game, but that's translated. In addition, all instances of Engrish have been fixed.

Overall, this is a very nice translation, and since it's the only one for this game, I highly recommend it.

    <desc>Puyo Puyo is a Japanese puzzle game developed by Compile as a spinoff to their Madou Monogatari series of RPGs.

The original Puyo Puyo was released in 1991 for the MSX2 computer and contained a basic one-player free-play mode, missions, and basic two-player mode. However, Sega and Compile worked on a heavily expanded version for the Sega System C-2 arcade board and released it in 1992. This version has been ported to various consoles, including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System, and Sega Game Gear, and has formed the basis for the entire Puyo Puyo series.

In North America and Europe, it was initially released in a heavily localised form, the Sega version being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.</desc>

    <desc>While Uncle Scrooge naps, Donald Duck is flipping through some old books in the library.

Waaack! Out falls a strange piece of paper from one of the books. It's a long-lost message from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom. He's hidden his most prized possession somewhere on earth. And he's left a map that leads to its whereabouts!

"I could be rich! Richer than Uncle Scrooge," Donald thinks to himself. But Big Bad Pete and his Ducky Gang are lurking outside the window. They're about to snatch the map, but Donald dashes away, safe for the moment.

"Donald, you're late!" Daisy scolds. "But Daisy, some-thing fabulous is waiting for me!" Donald squawks. "If I can find it, it will be a terrific surprise for you. I'll tell you all about it when I get back!"

If he comes back! Donald has no idea what dangers surround the hunt for the Great Duck Treasure. He only knows that he'll do anything to find it...

--From the Genesis Quackshot Starring Donald Duck instruction manual.

Overview:

I never knew how ineffective a bathroom plunger was as a weapon until I used one against a man with a bazooka. Sadly, Donald only has such outlandishly stupid weapons to use against people armed with the best weaponry money can buy. Normally I advise to charge forward, but what idiot would do so armed only with bathroom plungers, popcorn shooters and bubblegum blasters? Donald Duck comes to mind.

Yeah that's your arsenal, but if the job were easy a former American President would probably take it. But here we have the famous and frighteningly demented Donald Duck to the rescue. If he doesn't just freak out and bust a hole through your computer screen, you just might win the game.

As the moose should have told you at the entrance, Donald has found a treasure map and is on a worldwide search for Vidalia onions (no, of course not, treasure). He encounters numerous bad guys that he must defeat with his limited weaponry and even more limited intelligence. Donald travels first class on an aircraft piloted by his three nephews Pebbles, Bam Bam and Dino Huey, Dewey and Louie to ten exotic locations (if you consider downtown Duckburg exotic) such as Duckburg, Mexico, some Aztec Ruins, Translyvania, a Viking Ghostship (dark and moonlit - hint, hint), the South Pole, the Maharaja's Palace, Egypt (notice, not the Egypt), Ducky Gang's Hideout and Great Duck Treasure Island.

The game opens like a movie, which is original. Great graphics, as should be expected with most SEGA games. The manner in which you must win the game, moving back and forth through locations, is also original, making the game non-linear. I give it a 90, Mr. Clark. Easy to dance to and the words make a lot of sense.

Directions:

Donald chooses locations from the map to travel to and is transported to them by aircraft. He must fight his way through the locations, finding helpful objects that will assist him in his adventure, until he arrives at a place where he cannot continue without a special weapon or item.

This point is called a "checkpoint," and it is from here that he can call his aircraft. Hopefully a friend there will give him a clue as to what he needs, or the object needed will be obvious. He plants his flag (this is where he will return to when he comes back to the location), calls his aircraft, and travels to another location in search of the object.

Weapons:

- Yellow Plunger - 
only stuns bad guys for a few moments, but you get an unlimited supply

- Red Plunger 
fights foes and lets Donald climb obstacles (he's a Duck that talks but doesn't fly)

- Green Plunger 
sticks to critters that can fly, unlike ducks  Donald finds it on a dark night while looking for his courage

- Popcorn Shooter 
loaded by picking up corn items

- Bubblegum Shooter 
break downs obstacles  Gyro Gearloose has the ammo

C Button: Jump / Choose Weapon

Hints:

- Pepper Madness -

- Checkpoint -
The box to the left of the points meter on the information bar will start flashing when Donald is near a checkpoint.

    <desc>Here it is... the amazing conversion of the smash arcade sensation brings screaming-fast car racing to the Genesis! Pound the pedal and grind those gears, down the straights and around wicked hairpin turns. Whip through hairy S-curves, gut-flipping loop-the-loops and crazy corkscrews! With three cars to choose from, multiple music tracks and cool sound effects, Race Drivin' brings arcade-style auto speed competition to the Genesis!

Gameplay:

The gameplay resembles a driving game, featuring a car similar in appearance to the Ferrari Testarossa. The screen shows a first person perspective from inside the car, throgh the windshield. To separate it from other driving titles of that era, stunt loops and other road hazards were added. The game generally consists of 1 or 2 laps around the stunt track. In certain modes, the player races against the computer controlled car, Phantom Photon. The game challenges the players in a daredevil fashion and broke away from traditional racing games like Out Run or Pole Position. Stunts, a racing game produced later, has similar visuals, controls and tracks.

It also features a realistic manual transmission mode and force feedback steering wheel, in which the driver would have to properly operate the car as they would in real life.

A notable feature of the game is the "instant replay" display that is presented after a crash, which sets Hard Drivin' apart from most driving games of its time, which after a crash would just put the player back on the road, stopped, and let them accelerate again. Before resuming play after a crash, Hard Drivin' would run an approximately ten second animation, captioned "Instant Replay", which showed a wide aerial view of the movements of the player's car and surrounding vehicles leading up to the crash, with the player's car always centered on the screen. During the replay, the player could not change the action on screen, but the replay could be aborted to immediately get back to active gameplay. The replay would continue for about two or three seconds after the crash, showing a polygon-rendered fireball and the movement of the car, including any spinning, flipping, or bouncing off the struck obstacle.

The replays add to the appeal of the game and actually add a motivation to crash in spectacular ways in order to see them played out from the aerial view. Besides collisions, a non-survivable landing after going airborne (even if the car landed right-side up), or even going too far off-road, could cause a crash which would be replayed like any other crash, with the car even exploding into the same orange fireball. The game tracks the player's progress around the track by invisible waypoints (denoted by flags on the course map showing the player's progress when the game ends due to time running out), and after a crash, the car is placed back on the track at the last waypoint passed; this sometimes is a significant distance back from the point of collision. (One of the waypoints on each track was the marked checkpoint about halfway around, which when passed granted the player extra time.)

Race Drivin's approach to collisions or unrealistic events-putting the car back on the road at a standstill-was the norm for driving games until later games such as Cruisin' USA and its successors introduced intentionally artificial physics to force a car to always stay near the road and land right-side up pointing forward.

After going goes off-road, the player has ten seconds to return to the road, or else he will be stopped and returned to the road, at a standstill, at the last waypoint passed (just like when a crash occurs, but without an instant replay.)

    <desc>Radical Rex is a fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus on a skateboard who has to save the dinosaur race under the spell of an evil creature. The game consists of 10 levels set in the prehistoric age. Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.

    <desc>In the year 2090, Earth is invaded by extra-terrestrials. The World Alliance of Nations has developed a supersonic attack fighter, Raiden, to defend the Earth. A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them.

Gameplay:

The formula of the game is simple and typical for the era of this game. The player pilots the "Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter" through waves of enemies, and several levels. There are two types of weapons, and the player can collect several powerups for them to make them stronger. There are bombs and missile powerups as well as collectable medals which add to the score.

- Fighter -

Raiden fighter always starts with vulcan main weapon.

When player dies, the fighter drops items, based on the former fighter's weapon powers.

- Weapons -

    - Main weapon. There are 8 weapon levels:

        - Vulcan: Fires wide formation shots (max 7 directions).

        - Laser: Fires forward-concentrating shots.

    - Sub weapon. There are 4 weapon levels:

        - Homing Missile: Fires enemy chasing missiles.

        - Nuclear Missile: Fires forward-concentrating missiles. When it hits an enemy, the blast persists for a short period.

    - Bomb: Destroys bullets on screen, and damages enemies in the blast area. There is a moment of delay between pressing bomb button and explosion.

When a player's fighter shoots the other player's fighter, the attacker's projectiles transform into 'stars' that radiates from the attacked fighter.

When player dies, the fighter's fragments become projectiles that damage enemies.

- Items -

    - Red icon: Switches main weapon type to vulcan main shot. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - Blue icon: Switches main weapon type to laser main shot. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - H: Switches sub-weapon type to homing missile. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - M: Switches sub-weapon type to nuclear missile. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.

    - 1UP: Increases life stock by 1.

    - P: Maximizes both main shot and sub shot levels, assuming the fighter has the weapon type. If both shot type powers are already full, players gets 10000 points.

    - B: Increases bomb stock by 1. If player already has 7 bombs, player gets 5000 points.

    - Medal: Increases score by 300.

    - Miclus: Increases score by 3000.

    - Fairy: Increases score by 10000.

- Stages -

There are 8 stages in the game.

When continuing after all players are dead, player resumes from a predefined check point.

At the end of each stage, player gains stage bonus equals to the number of medals gained in a stage with current life, multiplied by number of bombs player possesses, multiplied by a 1000. If medal or bomb stock is 0, the count is equal to 1 for each affected field for scoring purposes.

After defeating the Stage 0 boss, the mission is completed, and player receives 1 million points for each completed loop. Afterwards, it will start back to Stage 1. This time around, enemies shoot faster and at a more rapid rate.

Hints:

1. AKWT-AA9J Infinite bombs

2. AE9A-AAF0 Start with 1 bomb

3. A29A-AAF0 Start with 6 bombs

4. BA9A-AAF0 Start with 8 bombs

5. AJFT-AA5C Infinite lives

6. PFCA-BJXG Each bomb power-up item is worth 2

7. AEIT-AAHT Some smaller obstacles easier to explode

8. AHEA-CAGY Some bigger obstacles easier to explode

9. BA9A-AA8E Don't lose missile power when you lose a life

10. A69A-BE8E Permanent invisible missiles

11. BBCT-BA5Y First laser power-up item gives you maximum power.

    <name>Rainbow Islands: Bubble Bobble II</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Rainbow Islands is a 1987 arcade game from Taito. The game is subtitled "The Story of Bubble Bobble 2" and is the sequel to Taito's hit game Bubble Bobble from the previous year. It is the second of four arcade games in the Bubble Bobble series (followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories, but itself has two direct sequels: Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2). The game was ported for numerous home computers and game consoles.

The basic premise of the game is that each level is an island which is slowly sinking into the sea. The player must therefore get to the top of each level, by jumping on platforms and making use of the game's most distinctive feature: the ability to produce solid rainbows, which are used both as platforms to stand on, and as a weapon.

One of the features which sets this game apart from many others (and has no doubt been responsible for the game's popularity) is its 'hidden depths'. While initially appearing to be quite a simple game, Rainbow Islands in fact has a vast number of secrets for the player to discover, including secret levels, secret power-ups and riddles. Because of these elements, completing the game properly requires a large amount of dedication from the player. The scoring system also has secrets, which allow vastly higher scores to be achieved than normal.

Gameplay:

The game is set on a chain of ten islands, each one with a different theme. Each island provides four rounds of gameplay, and once these are complete the player moves to the next island in the chain. The islands get progressively more difficult, with enemies moving much faster on the later ones. These are depicted on a map screen before the start of each island. The three secret islands are not visible until all 7 big diamonds are collected. Most consumer versions of the game completely lack the secret islands.

The main characters are Bubblun and Bobblun, the protagonists of Bubble Bobble (known as "Bub and Bob" in the western releases). However, in this game they appear in their human forms as "Bubby" and "Bobby", as opposed to the "bubble dragons" of the first game. Also unlike the first game, players must now "alternate" (i.e., take turns), with player one as Bubby (green shirt), and player 2 as Bobby (blue shirt) (as with the first game).

Hints:

- Start the game with virtually infinite lives -

In the option menu, choose number of lives and select '0'. Then you can start your game normally. When you died, instead of Game Over, you get a lot of extra lives like ??, ?! and other symbols in pair as your number of lives. However, it is not really unlimited. After you died a lot of times (about 400 times), your number of lives became 99, and when it reached 0, the game is over.

    <desc>- The Rescue -

Hand-to-hand combat! Grenades bursting! Machine guns rattling! Explosions, smoke, and the faces of men suddenly caught dead by a bullet.

These pictures burn in the mind of a man helping to build a simple temple in the mountains. The man is John Rambo, private citizen, former Green Beret. In Vietnam, Rambo earned his rep as a hero who couldn't be stopped, even in the face of impossible danger. Now he spends his days in a forgotten village, struggling with the anguish of memories he can't shake.

But today a stranger appears at the temple. "Rambo" the man says, "I've been looking for you"

Rambo stares at the speaker. The pain of the memories fades as he recognizes his old friend.

"Colonel Trautman!" Rambo says. "Why are you here?"

"Because I need you. I'm going into Afghanistan on a top secret mission. Right now the border is crawling with Russians. But I've got to get in there! You're the only one I can trust to get me across the border alive!"

Rambo's heart cringes at the idea of more war - for what! He gazes into the distance, remembering past horrors.

"Sorry, Colonel. My war is over."

Deep in a night-shrouded mountain pass somewhere between Pakistan and Afghanistan, three jeeps led by Colonel Trautman attempt to cross the border. Suddenly the sound of raging thunder surrounds them. A Russian Hind helicopter is in pursuit and firing! Before they can reach cover, two jeeps are hit and demolished! Then a voice booms out: "You cannot escape! Drop your weapons now!"

"Trautman's been caught!"

Hearing this, Rambo starts to boil with anger. All through Vietnam, Trautman was the only one who understood his deepest feelings. The Colonel was like a father to him. Now his life is at stake! If only Rambo had gone with him into Afghanistan! If only... if only...

Rambo turns to the agent who brought him the news. "I'm going after him! I want you to get my supplies. They've got Trautman, and now they're going to get their worst nightmare!"

--From the Genesis Rambo 3 instruction manual.

Directions:

Your mentor, and the best fry cook the U.S. Marines ever had, has been taken captive, so what must you do? Save the Colonel! Do you need anymore reason that that? So to get you started on your missions I give you the following information:

When you have selected the explosive arrow, the longer that you hold the "B" button down, the more powerful it becomes.

Explosive Arrows work against towers but not ammo dumps and conversely, Time Bombs work against ammo dumps but not towers.

Missions 1, 3, 5 and 6 have bonus rounds that you must win in order to advance.

Charge your explosive arrows to the fullest; jump out at the proper time and fire at the tank and helicopter! Simple Enough!
     
Special Objects-

Smiling Faces in a box give you extra lives

An "A" in a box gives you a Bow and Arrows

A "B" in a box gives you a Time Bomb

Hero or Baby? Which shall it be? Heroes will ignore the following information and just fight like the real Rambo would do while Babies, who just want to win, have no choice but to use these cookbook directions. Babies make me SICK!

Mission One-
After killing all the commies, blast your way through the gate with machine gun fire and explosive arrows. (OK, Baby, aren't you ashamed? You could have figured that out by yourself if you hadn't been so worried about your dirty diaper)

Mission Two-
OK Sissy, you will need to fire your machine gun (not your milk bottle) at the cells until the Secret Agent identifies himself. When he does, the place is about to blow up so get out quickly by blowing up the exit.

Mission Three-
You have to destroy the guard towers with timer bombs (like I was going to use oatmeal) and use machine gun fire to break through the gate.

Mission Four-
This is Real Rambo Rampage Time! You have to destroy EVERYTHING until some hokey ratio reaches 100%. (10,000 dead commies and I still only got a 98%!)

Mission Five-
He's at it again! Destroy the tanks and helicopters using fully charged explosive arrows (is there another kind?) and kill everybody (except for yourself - you are a psychopath, not a suicidal mental patient).

Mission Six-
You Whiny Babies make me so sick I shouldn't even tell you what to do! But here goes: search through the maze until you find the Colonel (you know, the guy that didn't need cheat notes to get here. Wait a second, he has been captured. Maybe cheat notes would have helped him). 

Gameplay:

Based on the film of the same name, this game puts you in John Rambo's shoes as he travels to Afghanistan to free Colonel Trautman from the Soviets.

In six missions, Rambo must complete various objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, prisoners must be freed and enemy ammunition supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an overhead perspective and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous crossbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies.

After some of the missions, the perspective switches to a view behind Rambo and additional boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or helicopters must be destroyed using the crossbow. While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other obstacles from enemy fire.

Controls:

A Button: Select Special Weapon
B Button: Use Special Weapon
C Button: Fire Machine Gun
Start Button: Start / Pause

Hints:

- Your Friend The Knife -
Knifing certain soldiers gives you extra lives

- Limited Invincibility -
In Mission 2, go to the destructable box up and to the far left from the starting point. Proceed to the left until a little shiny bit of the box is showing. Destroy the box with an arrow, making sure there's no enemy soldiers on the screen. As soon as there's an impact, walk left as far as you can with a trail of smoke behind you. You will be invincible until you reach a bonus stage where you can be killed, or until you destroy another box.

You play as a robot fighter called EX-CP who shoots at specified targets in a level while destroying the various enemies and ammunition you may encounter. You can move left to right freely (so if you miss a target you can go back) and can either walk or hover up and fly, but will come down automatically after you release up or stay up too long.</desc>

A wicked group has invaded the "Skyscraper" and has tried to make it their own. If the situation is left as it is, the place would eventually be controlled by the wicked group.

Gameplay:

Rastan Saga 2 is the sequel to Rastan, containing the same hack-em'/slash-'em gameplay as the original. You are a warrior who must get through a number of levels, and trying to collect gems which can only be obtained by defeating the end-of-level bosses. Collecting power-ups along the way awards you with extra life or better weapons.

Gameplay:

RBI 3 also has every major league team available from the 1990 season, as well as postseason teams from 1983-1989. A regular season feature was available for RBI 3. Players could choose one team to compete against every other team. All star teams and postseason teams were eligible for this season mode. Passwords were given after each game to help players complete schedules. Once all teams had been defeated, the player had to compete against a fictional all star team from Japan, which included players with incredible HR and AVE stats and pitchers that could not be hit.

    <desc>Good evening, Mr. Phelps. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to undertake a perilous rescue mission to the Adrianne star system. The planet has been laid waste by corporate raiders from the Wellmax company, who are even now going planetside to conduct a mopping-up operation for the few survivors hiding out in the city's tunnel system. Time is limited, so the decision to act must be made immediately. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds....

Only the boys from Liverpool could pull off a funny little arcade game that manages to combine the best of both the platform and shooter genres. The attempts at humorous stabs of various financial personages and events is stilted, but it's still a fun game to play. It's a shame that Sony chose not to distribute it, because it sure is a neat little piece of work.

It is a sequel to the 1987 game Shinobi, and the first game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive. It should also not be confused with the 2002 game with the same name. It was later released on the Mega Drive based arcade platform the Mega-Tech.

The game was also released in several compilations: Mega Games 2 and 6-Pak for the Mega Drive, Sega Classics Arcade Collection for the Sega Mega CD, Sega Smash Pack for PCs, and Sega Smash Pack for the Sega Dreamcast. It was re-released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.</desc>

    <desc>Revolution X is a light-gun arcade game developed by Midway featuring the rock band Aerosmith. It was brought among other consoles to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn in 1994 and 1996, respectively, with the Mega Drive version not released in Japan.

Revolution X has Aerosmith in a dystopian version of 1996, fighting against the government who have declared war on youth culture. It was very poorly received, mostly because despite it being a light gun game, no light guns were supported in the home ports. All home ports also have some level of censorship - the Mega Drive and Saturn versions tone down the amount of blood, while the Mega Drive version also tweaks the exotic dancers.</desc>

    <desc>Richard Scarry's Busytown is a Sega Genesis and MS-DOS game that was released for a younger generation of gamers. The game consists of an interactive story book that was written by Richard Scarry. Most of the game is spent exploring Busytown looking for things to interact with using either the gamepad or a special mouse that could be purchased separately from the game and the console system. Young gamers will do everything from building things to delivering something to repair a ship. Games are relatively short and can be finished in about an hour. Familiar faces from Richard Scarry's works of literature include Huckle Cat and Lowly Worm.

There is also a game where the player controls the wind and can cause controlled havoc at the city park. All games offer basic vocabulary practice as simple puzzles help improve basic problem solving and English language skills. The voice quality of this game is realistic when compared to the cartoons of that era. All of the characters act and talk like their counterparts in the books and the cartoon series. If the player puts too much lemonade or soda in the glass and spills some out of the glass, then one of the characters asks the player "Are you blind?" in a gentle voice. Delivering stuff allows the town to slowly come to life; similar to a juvenile version of SimCity.

Well, Rings of Power is insanely hard. You can wander forever without any luck. You can be killed instantly. Your money/food/water drains very quickly. The Naughty Dog staff made a great game, but the difficulty is very hard for any average player.

But now you can beat the game. You have lots of advantages in the hacked version "The Hand of Nexus":

- Your party is Invincible. You can't loose HP or MP on battle nor the Temple of Variation and Necropolis, except in some very rare cases where you can loose a bit of HP in battle.

- All your characters will gain the max level when you get them some experience.

- You will always have all the goods at max value.

- You will start with the So Sym, Map, Sextant and the Magic Leaf. No more need to go the annoying Magic Leaf maze.

- When you enter the map, you will teleport to any point where you left the pointer on it.

- You will start with max Food, Water and Gold.

- You have infinite Food, Water and Gold.

- You can access the Inventory in Battle! Just hold right and press start after you select the spells.

- You have all the spells of the whole party.

Thanks a lot to Pugsy and Ugetab, and all the cool people at GSHI. Without their support, I never could make this hack possible.

    <desc>Rise of the Robots is a Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear versus fighting game.

The game is divided into a single player mode and a two player versus mode. In single player mode the player controls the ECO32-2 Cyborg as he confronts the Supervisor's minions across the vast facilities of Electrocorp. The order in which each droid is fought is fixed, with each next adversary more difficult than the last. The sixth and final level is a confrontation with the Supervisor droid itself. Each character is introduced by a short CGI sequence, followed by an analysis of potential weaknesses.

In two player versus mode, one player controls the ECO35-2 droid by default, while the other chooses between one of the five droids seen in single player mode (a special cheat code can enable the Supervisor as well). Players then battle out against each other in 2 to 7 rounds.</desc>

    <desc>Risk is a 1994 conversion of the board game Risk produced by Sculptured Software for the Sega Mega Drive. Risk is a turn-based game for two to six players, either player- or computer-controlled, which works very similarly to the Parker Brothers board game. The standard version is played on a board depicting a stylised Napoleonic-era political map of the Earth, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents. Players control armies with which they attempt to capture territories from other players. The primary object of the game is "world domination," or to occupy every territory on the board and in so doing, eliminate all other players. Using area movement, Risk ignores limitations such as the vast size of the world and the logistics of long campaigns.

There are three difficulties for the computer players to be. Beginner difficulty computers shoot slowly in arcade mode and difficult ones shoot very quickly and with a better range accuracy. They also tend to try and overwhelm an area rather than build up in multiple places.</desc>

Ristar being one of Sega's later releases for the Genesis, it didn't quite get enough recognition. But also being one of the later creations, it came out just wonderful. The graphics are nicely sized and everything in the game is vibrant and colorful, not to mention detailed.

The music tracks are fitting, being very upbeat and cheerful to match the mood. Game-play is wonderful, too, Ristar being your side-scroller with a few little twists as well. If you're curious, give this game a go. You won't be disappointed.

Directions:

Yep, more classic side-scrolling action packed in Ristar! Unlike Sonic, though, you'll have to rely on technique and patience to be able to venture through the vast worlds in this game. There are many treasures to be found, so make sure you find everything!

This game is separated into six different worlds you have to venture in: Flora, Undertow, Scorch, Sonata, Freon, and Automaton.

The final area is a sort of spaceship level. During the first six areas, you'll encounter mini bosses who you'll have to fight.

Ristar has a different way of fighting and getting around. Using his super long arms, he's able to latch onto enemies and strike or latch onto a branch and pull himself up or climb up walls. There are also aquatic levels, in which Ristar swims, but he's good in that environment also.

    <desc>Grab the controls of your sleek and deadly high-performance racing machine and head into an action packed race of the future, where survival is the only law. Roar down the straightaways and spin around turns while dodging land mines and toxic spills. Blast enemies out of your way with your high-calibre machine guns and other special weapons dropped by your support jet.

Your object is to reach the Rally Point at the end of each level - 5O in all. The further you get, the more difficult it becomes. Avoid crashing into enemy cars. Watch out for crossfire from gun turrets. And if that's not enough for you, some levels are mined!

To help you reach the Rally Point, you get refueled at the Check point (the halfway point of each level). You can also get extra fuel by picking up green globes you find along the way or by blasting certain enemies to force them to give up their fuel (shown as a red globe).

Keep a close eye on your fuel level! If you run out, it'll cost you one of five lives.

--From the Genesis Road Blasters instruction manual.

Directions:

     Run and Gun! Use your weapons to destroy everything that moves, except for the green balls on the road, which are extra fuel. Run over them and continue on your merry killing-spree way. You have 50 levels of car-crashing, missile-launching, machine gun firing insanity ahead of you.

Have a blast!

     You get to play with high tech weapons like Cruise Missiles, an Electro Shield that protects your car, Nitro Injector for increased speed and an U.Z. Cannon. And sometimes there is a jet that brings these goodies to you just like Santa. Free and everything. Yeah, at first I thought it was an alien space ship come to probe me, but it wasn't. Just drive under the plane and the goodies come to you. If you've been a good little boy.

For the bean Counters:
     Stingers             50 points
     Command Cars         100 points
     Rat Jeeps            50 points
     Cycles               100 points
     Gun Turrets          200 points

Special Controller Options:
     Option A:
     Speed is pre-set
     Option B:
     Use B-Button or UP to control speed 

Gameplay:

- Object of the Game -

The object of the game is to complete all 50 rallies without running out of fuel. There is no limit to how many vehicles a player can receive to complete a rally, as long as they have fuel. However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player's fuel tank. In the arcade version, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off, however the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally.

- Fuel -

Players can get fuel in four ways: green globes, red globes, a checkpoint, and the rally point. Green globes are on the road, and fill the main gas tank. Red globes are revealed by shooting enemies on the road. After completing each rally, the player is awarded extra reserve fuel determined by how many enemies were destroyed during the level. Each consecutive kill shot increases the multiplier, from 1 up to 10. A miss lowers that multiplier by 1. Whatever the multiplier is at when the finish line is crossed is multiplied by the value of the enemies slain, and that much fuel is awarded.

Each rally features a midway point, denoted by a line on the road which the vehicle crosses. At this point, the amount of fuel in the main tank is restored to what it was at the beginning of the rally (the amount of fuel in the main tank given at the rally's start fluctuates throughout the game). The amount of fuel in the reserve tank, however, is not restored.

When a player gets low on fuel in their main tank, a fuel light will blink on and an alarm will sound on the display. Using up the main tank will mean the vehicle then uses what reserve fuel is stored.

- Enemies - 

There are various enemies that appear throughout the rallies.

    - Stingers (orange cars)

    - Command Cars (purple) - bulletproof bumpers, must be killed by a cruise missile

    - Cycles

    - Rat Jeeps - comes in from the left, stops, then swerves to the right

    - Gun Turrets - stationary on the side of the road

    - Mines - set on the road, cannot be destroyed. A special alarm on the display alerts players when mines have been laid ahead.

    - Toxic Spills (driving the vehicle over them will spin the car out)

- Special Weapons -

At various points along the course, an airplane will come into view and drop a weapon from its underbelly. If the player lines up the car to catch the weapon, the secondary weapon is activated. That weapon is kept until it is used up, the car crashed or another weapon picked up. If a player catches a special weapon while using another one, the first will be replaced by the newest weapon.

    - UZ Cannon: A rapid fire gun that does not deplete the multiplier. A limited amount of ammunition is supplied.

    - Cruise Missile: Detonation eliminates all enemies on the screen. Three missiles are included.

    - Nitro Inject: Increases the speed of the car from 210 to 298 km/h for a limited distance. Three nitros to a pack.

    - Electro Shield: Allows the car to drive through any enemy or obstacle unharmed for a short distance. Three to a pack.

- Production -

The game's creators originally intended for an electronicized version of the '50s pop song "Mr. Sandman" to play during one of the levels. This was never implemented into the game.

A promotional giveaway was accessible on the original arcade version, where players could send in their score (when all 50 levels are completed) and receive a free RoadBlasters T-shirt.

During gameplay, a slightly robotic-sounding female voice gives the player advice in the form of several short phrases, often related to using the Nitro Inject, or when a player destroys several enemies in a few seconds. These phrases include "Hit it" and "Eat lead, roadhog".

When a player has the Nitro Inject activated when crossing the rally's finish line, the vehicle will drive off into the horizon, and the female voice will state, "Now that's cruising."

    <desc>Road Rash 3: Tour De Force is the sequel to Road Rash II, and was released exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive in 1995.

Road Rash 3 makes several changes over its predecessor - instead of being set across California (Road Rash) or the United States (Road Rash II), Road Rash 3 takes place across the world. It also makes use of digitised graphics similar to Mortal Kombat.</desc>

    <desc>Road Rashing isn't just a sport. It's an attitude! Road Rash II is the ultimate 2-player racing game with a radically unique split-screen for distinguishing between racers. Cruising cross-country was never this hairy! Spectacular new body-torquing wipe outs! More obstacles to crash into than ever before. Terrorize your opponents on 5 new tracks, each with 5 different levels. Swing a steel chain for some real heavy metal damage! 15 brand new, lightning-fast cycles, including nitro-equipped Super-Bikes!

Directions:

Race and fight your way through the tracks while periodically buying new bikes and watching out for the cops. 

Gameplay:

A motorcycle racing game with an attitude. You race in varying environments for ever increasing sums of money. With that money you can buy faster and better bikes. There are many objects on the road to watch out for, from cars to rocks to signs, if you hit one you'll go flying and loose valuable time. If you crash too often your bike can get wrecked. You can also attack other racers. The default attack is a punch, but some racers have weapons, which you can steal and use against them. The police patrol the various courses, so if you're not careful you can get busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but also a fighting game.

    <desc>
RoboCop Versus The Terminator is a sidescrolling shoot 'em up that combines elements from the Terminator and RoboCop movie franchises similar to Aliens vs. Predator. The story was largely based on a comic book of the same name, though elements may have been taken from a script for a feature-length film (which was later cancelled). The SNES version has a slightly different story.

The player controls RoboCop, who has re-assembled himself in the future to stop Skynet. With a variety of weapons he must defeat numerous Terminators in an attempt to save the future. There is also a fight with an ED-209 from the RoboCop series.

A NES version of the game was planned, but cancelled.</desc>

    <desc>Robotnik's Revenge is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 by ColinC10. It is a "boss rush" hack, in which all seventeen bosses from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 are fought in a somewhat arbitrary order over the course of a single level. The game takes place in Death Egg Zone from Sonic 2, and is meant to imply that there is more to the ship than there is in the original game.

Time spent completing the boss run is kept and the total time is given at the end of the course, along with a ranking. In Time Attack mode there are infinite lives and rings that can be found in-between battles. In survival mode there are only 3 lives and no rings.

    <desc>The last game I want to describe in greater detail here is this little gem: Rockman X3, to westerners more commonly known as Mega Man X3.

The only official Mega Man game produced for the Genesis is Capcom's Megaman: The Wily Wars (also known as Rockman Megaworld). As some of you may know, Mega Man and its spin-offs are one of the longest video game series in existence (the "classic" line up having reached number nine recently). Rockman X is the Super Nintendo version of said series and brought it to a whopping eight games in its very own right. Why did the pirate hackers choose to port part three for the Genesis? I have no idea. What I also noticed is that unlike with other hacks, the programmers responsible for this port didn't remove the logo of the original developer  it was a bit strange to see the Capcom logo pop up at the beginning.

At the first glance, the port seems to be very accurate, capturing the Mega Man feeling pretty well. You've got your standard blaster, which, in accordance with the X series, you can charge to fire off a bigger shot. You've got the Mega Man sprite and the common enemies, and also the energy- and weapon power ups. Oddly enough, there is a strange frame around the screen during play, with a different one for each stage. It seems similar to the frames in Duke Nukem 3D or Doom 32X, so I guess they have been included to reduce the number of active sprites on screen to make the game run smoother. That, or the programmers simply thought it looked nice.

However, once you play this game for a little while, you notice several rather severe changes. First, there aren't any cut scenes. The X series told a story in which stages where intersected with some cut scenes where characters exchanged dialog and scripted events took place. Though not important to the gameplay, they were one thing that distinguished that spin-off from the classic series and added a nice touch. Considering space restrictions, leaving those out of the game is quite understandable. 

Second, another staple that distinguished the X series from the classic one (at least from the earlier games) was armor upgrades that could be found throughout the stage. Mega Man could learn new abilities, and using those abilities he could find even more power ups, motivating the player to play through the stages a second or third time in order to reach that energy tank that was unreachable at the first playthrough. In this port, you have all those armor upgrades and extra abilities straight from the beginning! Without cut scenes and the search for those little extras, the main features that distinguished the X spin-off from the original series have therefore been removed entirely. (By the way, I noticed an odd thing: There seems to be a graphical glitch in which Mega Man, who you'll generally see in his maxed-out armor right from the beginning, suddenly reverts back to his regular appearance for a few milliseconds when being hit!

Does that mean that for some reason, the programmers included all sprites and animations for Mega Man, even if some of them have become superfluous since the armor extras don't exist anymore? This just seems lazy and shoddy!)

Also, enemies don't randomly drop power ups, which makes the game pretty hard, but it isn't such a big deal since the programmers have retained all the "fixed" goodies from the original level design. However, there is one cut that really bothers me. The main distinguishing features of the entire Mega Man series were the weapons and boss system: After each level you can choose which boss to tackle next. After defeating a boss you get his weapon, which is particularly powerful against one (or two) of the other bosses. So you had a number of weapons, each with their own energy bar, that you could switch around as you liked or needed to.

Well, guess what? For some reason, this feature has been removed! The only weapon you'll have for the entire game is the standard (chargeable) blaster! You don't get any boss weapons, so the entire premise behind the selection of which boss to tackle next has become moot. Even worse, whereas in the original game the final boss only became selectable after you had completed every stage at least once, in the Genesis port you can directly jump into the boss stage! And since the boss weaknesses don't apply anymore, and you can only use your blaster, the strength of each boss has been significantly reduced, making the final battle laughably easy in the process!

So, what we have here is a Mega Man port where the programmers took a Mega Man game, kept the sprites and levels, and removed all the mechanics that made this series stand out amongst all the other platformers out there! It seems the programmers weren't quite up to the task of capturing the essence of capturing and adequately adapting the original game mechanics to the Genesis, which seems to be a lot harder to do as it is the case with a classic jump-'n-run. Considering this, however, it was a very odd choice to try and adapt Mega Man in the first place.

    <desc>Rock 'n Roll Racing is an arcade combat racing game. Combat plays a heavy role in the game, as each car has a frontal weapon, such as a laser or missile, and a drop weapon, such as spikes or mines. As you complete races, you get more money to upgrade your car.

Gameplay:

The game pits four racers against each other, with up to two of them being player-controlled and the rest being AI opponents. Races are viewed from an isometric viewpoint.

While it is a racing game, there is heavy emphasis on attacking competitor's vehicles; since the cars always reappear with full health just a few seconds after blowing up, the only "harm" done is falling behind in the race. Players are rewarded with a monetary "attack bonus" each time they provide the finishing blow against another car using their projectile weapons (and a similar "lapping bonus" when they gain a full one-lap lead on an opponent during the race). To this end (the continual destruction and restoration of the racing vehicles), the tracks are littered with mines and health power-ups, as well as money power-ups. Other hazards include oil slicks, snow drifts, and lava, depending on which planet is hosting the race.

Players are updated on the race by commentator "Loudmouth Larry" (Larry "Supermouth" Huffman), who makes comments like "The stage is set, the green flag drops!" (or "Let the carnage begin!"), and "Rip: is about to blow!" in an enthusiastic tone at appropriate moments during the race. (There is a slight pause between a character's name and any given phrase, as each name and each phrase is its own sound effect, which can be heard in the F/X screen.)

Between races, players can spend the money they've earned on more advanced equipment for their vehicle (engines, tires, shocks, and shielding) or on increasing their capacity for the frontal weapon (energy blasts or missiles), rear weapon (slip sauce or mines), and turbo boost (jump jets or nitro boosts), each of which can max out at seven. Despite their limited capacity, every racer will have their weapon and boost charges replenished at the start of each lap in a race.

Each race goes on for four laps, and the final standings provide rewards. Money is used to buy upgrades and new cars, while points are used to advance to the next racing division or the next planet. In two-player mode, when only one player has sufficient points, the character in charge of advancement asks "Leave your loser friend behind?", allowing that player to continue alone by removing the other player from the game. Once left behind, the player has no choice but to hope that they had written down their most recent password (available from the F/X screen) and that the other player will reset the game and let them try again at some point.

- Selectable characters -

    - Snake Sanders (Earth)
    - Tarquinn (Aurora)
    - Jake Badlands (Xeno Prime)
    - Katarina Lyons (Panteros V)
    - Ivanzypher (Fleagull)
    - Cyberhawk (Serpentis)
    - Olaf from The Lost Vikings (Valhalla)

There are six characters that are readily selectable, each of which has a +1 enhancement for two of the four skills that are related to how well their vehicle handles: acceleration, top speed, cornering, and jumping. Olaf, from The Lost Vikings, another Silicon &amp; Synapse game that was in development at the same time, is a hidden character, requiring a code to access him, and instead of two skills, Olaf has three. At the character selection screen (with Snake showing on the screen), while holding down L, R, and Select, press left then right on the d-pad, and Olaf will appear. There is an eighth character, also hidden, who has no picture or name but has the +1 bonus for all four of the available skills. This character is sometimes called the "Phantom", and he/she/it is only accessible using specially-crafted passwords.

Many of the characters, location names, etc. take their name or likeness from hard rock music. Snake Sanders is based on Whitesnake vocalist David Coverdale, Jake Badlands is named for Jake E. Lee, guitarist for a band called Badlands, and Cyberhawk is most likely a reference to the cover art for the Judas Priest album Screaming for Vengeance.

    <desc>Roger Clemens is known by some as the greatest pitcher in baseball history. In  Roger Clemens MPV Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full regular season can be played including the World Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. While playing in Regular Season mode the player can see their chosen team's progress by using the in game calendar showing all the games.

Players select a fictional team from the following groups:

    - National Division West: San Francisco Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big Cats, San Diego Suns, Houston Mustangs, and Atlanta Condors.

    - National Division East: Chicago Swords, Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. Louis Commandos, Pittsburgh Panthers, and Philadelphia Generals.

    - American Division West: Oakland Bashers, Seattle Pioneers, Minnesota Hounds, California Waves, Texas Cowboys, Chicago Red Birds, and Kansas City Kings.

    - American Division East: Toronto Bears, Boston Hornets, New York Rebels, Detroit Wheels, Milwaukee Marshals, Baltimore Eagles, and Cleveland Tomahawks.

Each team has a set of players the make up the team each with their own skill level and statistics which, like the teams, is fictional other then Clemens himself who is on the Boston Hornets team.

When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a 'ball'. The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base.

There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball.

The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.

    <desc>The game's plot is set around the same time period as its predecessor Rolling Thunder 2. With Albatross and Leila currently assigned to tracking down Gimdo, a new Rolling Thunder agent codenamed Jay is given the task to track down Geldra's second-in-command, Dread (a green skinned humanoid resembling Maboo from the first game). The story is presented in a more cinematic fashion than the previous games, featuring animated cut scenes between stages and on-screen text dialogue between the characters. Jay is assisted via radio by a contact named Ellen, who provides him with mission objectives.

Gameplay:

The game maintains the "shoot-and-take cover" formula of the previous installments. In Rolling Thunder 3, the player progresses through 10 levels and 3 secret areas (including an abandoned version of the original game's first stage) mostly by shooting hostile enemies, replenishing ammo by entering specially marked doors, and dodging or crouching under enemy fire by hiding behind objects such as crates. Unlike Rolling Thunder 2, the game features only a single-player mode. However, Rolling Thunder 3 builds upon the formula by adding additional elements to the series.

Rolling Thunder 3 offers its fair share of new features to the series. Players now have the option to select one weapon from a total nine before beginning each level. In addition to the sub-machine gun, there's a flamethrower and laser gun similar to the ones in the Genesis version of Rolling Thunder 2 and three different types of grenades: regular, flash and cracker. Once the player's starting special weapon has been chosen in one stage, it cannot be chosen again in later stages.

There are now two separate fire buttons, with one button mapped for the standard pistol and the other for the special weapon. The player also has the ability to shoot at angles or slash enemies with a knife when no special weapon is equipped. As they progress through the game, players will also be introduced to fast-paced vehicle stages, controlling Jay as he rides either a motorcycle on slick highways or jet-skis across rapid waters.

The game does not require the player to complete the stages within a time limit and thus eliminates the time bonus doors. However, taking too long summons a sniper who begins shooting at Jay. Fortunately, the player's health bar consists of three health units instead of one, giving Jay the ability to endure more hits before dying. In addition, when Jay dies, the game allows the player to restart from the exact position he died at, rather than forcing the player to continue from a check point or the beginning of the stage as the prequels had done.

As with the console versions of the previous games, the game gives player a password to begin a harder second quest that features a slightly extended ending once the game has been finished once. There are also another hidden password that replaces Jay's sprite in the game with that of Ellen dressed as a female agent. She has no cut scenes and the ending remains unchanged.

    <desc>Darius II is a side-scrolling space shoot 'em up developed by Taito. It is the sequel to the 1986 game Darius. Western Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System releases were renamed Sagaia. Like the first game, the player controls a space ship shooting at various enemies that resemble fish in a non-linear level order. A port to the Sega Saturn using the original name was released exclusively in Japan and Europe.

Proco and Tiat, seeing the planet Darius in ruin, create a new planet called Orga. Their descendents, Proco Jr. and Tiat Young, receive a mayday signal from another civilization born from Darius's ruins, prompting them to take the Silverhawk, a ship, back to save this other civilization from evil forces.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>It's Saturday night and the Slam Masters have arrived! Ten of the biggest and beefiest wrestlers ever to step into the ring have gathered for one bone-crushing, back-breaking tournament where there are NO RULES! Step into the ring and get ready for no-holds barred wrestling as you bounce your opponents off the ropes and clotheline the fools! Or dare them to take the fight outside the ring where brawls with tables, chairs and bottles are all part of the action. And just when you've got enough muscle, grab a friend and try out the sinister Death Match, where only the ultimate Slam Master can survive the barbed wire ropes and the booby-trapped floor!

Directions:

Wrestling is an easy enough concept to understand. You try to pin your opponent for 3 seconds to win the match. However, this is an objective which will make this game a whole lot of fun.

To be able to pin your opponent, you need to beat on him until his energy bar slowly drains down to nothing and then knock him down, afterwards attempting the 1-2-3. If you can do so, you win the match. However, if both opponents fail to score a pinfall in the time given in the match, the player who has the most health remaining is declared the winner. If both have the same amount of health in an occasion, then the match is considered a "draw."

In a match, you will probably need to break out the whole arsenal of moves to win. Some moves consist of running. In order to run, you have to double tap either left or right to charge in the respective direction. Whether you bounce off of the ropes or hit your opponent, the directionals will lead you there. If you bounce off of the ropes, however, you gain another level of speed. Another technique that takes a little more time to master is the art of grappling. To be able to pull this move off, you must be standing next to your opponent and then hit the right and attack buttons. You can now either pull off either an Irish Whip (a throw at the ropes) or a body slam, depending on which button you press.

Gameplay:

The original Slam Masters plays like a traditional wrestling game, only the game used a view similar to that commonly used in the fighting game genre. The game uses a three button configuration (grab, attack, and jump).

Each character has two special attacks: a non-grappling technique and a finisher. When an opponent's life meter is depleted, he must either be pinned for a three-count or forced to submit. Defeating all of the other wrestlers results in winning the championship belt, which must then be defended against the entire roster.

There are two game modes: Single Match, where the player fights in a series one-on-one matches against the CPU; and Team Battle Royale, where the player and another partner (controlled by another player or by the CPU) competes in a series of two-on-two matches. The game can be played by up to four players.

Controls:  

A Button: Attack, Pick up a nearby weapon
B Button: Jump
C Button: Pin
Start Button: Pause game

Hints:

- Increase the damage of your moves -
Pause the game right as your move lands, doing this will add to the amount of damage it inflicts.

    <desc>Rev up the Mystery Machine because Shaggy, Scooby and the rest of the gang have some mysteries to solve. Put yourself in the shoes of Shaggy, as he and Scooby venture off in search of snacks while Freddy, Daphne and Velma head in another direction. Unfortunately, Shaggy and Scooby find more than snacks - they also find trouble.

At Blake's Hotel, find the clues that will trap the so-called ghost of an ancient chieftain that is scaring away all of the guests of Daphne's Uncle.

A fun-filled day at the carnival turns into a mission to find a clown bent on revenge and rescue Fred, Daphne and Velma. These interactive mysteries let Shaggy pick-up and examine objects, and eventually use them to set a trap. Scooby will help out by pointing and sniffing around. Put all the clues together and you've solved the mystery!

--From the Genesis Scooby Doo Mystery instruction manual.

Directions:

Directions-
Listen to the introductions to the games, look at everything and use the Actions. You have unlimited time, lives and energy.

You collect items that you find using the "Take" action that adds them to your inventory. You view the items in the Inventory by pressing the C-Button. You select them the same way that you select an Action.

Gameplay:

The player controls Norville "Shaggy" Rogers as well as Scooby Doo simultaneously (he automatically mimics any movements that the player makes as Shaggy} making gameplay unique. The object of the game is to find clues to solve the 4 mysteries in the game. These clues can be obtained by finding them in the open, completing a specific task, or having Scooby "sniff out" hidden clues in each area. These clues give the players Mystery points and more points can be earned in the bonus levels. If the player accumulates 10,000 points, they will receive an extra life. In addition, the player must avoid hazards such as small creatures, falls from high areas, or the level Monster. Each of these will add to the players "Fright Meter" which, if full, will result in the player losing a life. Once enough clues have been gathered, Velma will send you to Fred to help him build a trap to catch the monster. The player then has to lure the monster to the trap before the end of level cutscene plays.

At the beginning of each level, only a small portion will be accessible, but as more clues are found, more of the level can be explored. Between each case, a game clip of the Mystery Machine driving along with on-screen dialogue from the gang inside is shown. The mysteries themselves don't have much plot before or after each case, and the person in the monster suit is usually never met until they are unmasked.

- Characters -

The other three members of Mystery Inc. are there to help solve the case as well, though they are not playable. They do each serve a specific task however:

Fred Jones - The leader of the group, he will usually provide information on the mystery as well as help Shaggy and Scooby open locked doors. At the end of each mystery, the player must find specific items which Fred will use to build a trap to catch the monster.

Daphne Blake - The beauty of the group, Daphne may not help with the case itself, but she will provide Shaggy and Scooby with a supply of Scooby Snacks which will help keeps the players "Fright Meter" down. She will only give a Scooby Snack if the player has found enough clues.

Velma Dinkley - The brains of the group, the player must bring any clues they find to her for analysis. Each clue adds to the players point total which will give them a life for gaining enough of them.

- Levels -

There are four levels in the game, and the player receives a password after each one to allow them to return at any time.

1) Spooky Shipwreck - This is the Red Ryan which is being haunted by a ghostly pirate named One-Eyed Matt. He is actually after treasure on sunken ships nearby which he planned to melt down and steal .

2) Haunted Amusement Park - The Fun Fair is being haunted by an Evil Clown who seeks to close the park as revenge for being fired when he was the parks janitor.

3) Abandoned Ranch - The Tar Monster is scaring everyone away from this ranch in order to buy the land cheap and then sell it at a profit due to it containing valuable minerals.

4) Haunted House - A house belonging to Daphne's Uncle which is being haunted by a vampire named Count Bagosi. He is trying to scare everyone away to protect his illegal counterfeiting operation.

- Bonus Levels -

There are two bonus levels hidden in each mystery.

The first is found in the kitchen area. In this level, the player controls Scooby Doo who is standing on his hind legs holding a slice of bread in each hand. Shaggy is behind him in a refrigerator with his back to the screen. Shaggy throws food items out which the player must catch by moving Scooby side to side. The food stacks up as it is caught but if Scooby moves too fast some of it will fall. If the sandwich is large enough, then the player will be awarded with a Scooby Bonus.

The second is found randomly in each level, but usually appears upon entering a new area of the level. On this level, Shaggy plays a game of "Whack a Mole" with a mallet on three vases. The player must use the directional buttons to tell Shaggy where to swing. The object is to hit as many monsters (ghosts, vampires, knights, etc) as possible without hitting Scooby or the other members of the gang. Points are added for monsters hits and subtracted for hits to friends. Time Bonus, Time Freeze, and Speed Boost can also be collected from the vases to prolong the game and get more points. If the player scores enough points in the time limit, they receive a Scooby Bonus.

    <desc>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same, your character is an officer of the UEO: The Underwater Earth Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the SeaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the SeaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command include

    - The Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right

    - Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.

    - Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it is the only vessel that can pick up undersea objects for transport

    - Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches

    - Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and SeaQuest mascot: Darwin the dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.

Gameplay:

The game is divided into two parts; one in which you control the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and are able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and the actual horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which you are to achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and even a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require you to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels, others have you make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where you have to rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and have to use armed subs to clear several cave-ins before you can bring in the only mini-sub you have that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs.

The missions also typically involve combat between your mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require you to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.

The other part of the game is the overworld where the player controls the seaQuest herself. These areas give you access to several menus in which you can replace lost equipment, buy new weapons for the seaQuest, and read up on the various missions you will receive while in your quadrant. While traveling your quadrant, you will also come across minefields, automated torpedo launchers and hostile submarines, many of which you need to destroy in order to achieve missions you are assigned in their area. For example, there's a mission in which you are to seal the leaks in an oil tanker sunk by ecological terrorists. In addition to accomplish this objective with your mini-subs, you need to not only complete the mission itself, but also to use the seaQuest herself to sink every terrorist submarine near the oil tanker wreck.

The game features a currency system, and awards you money for destroying enemy targets and completing objectives. The player can also lose money for destroying underwater settlements and killing animals present in some missions. Money is spent on weapons, countermeasures and mines for your seaQuest submarine, as well as replacements for lost vessels in missions. You don't need to spend money on repairs, though, as the seaQuest and her complement subs repair themselves over time.

    <desc>At the end of First Samurai, the Demon King was able to flee back in time to ancient Japan, so our hero follows him back in time, and has 10 levels awaiting him. Unlike the original, each world is split into sub-levels, with a boss at the end of each one, emphasising the arcade side of the gameplay, which still combines hacking and slashing with puzzle-solving.

As in the first game, you start without weaponry but can pick up swords and daggers as you progress through the levels. There are lots of hidden sections as you progress, which open up more of the end sequence to you, as well as several subgames including a shoot 'em up mode.

    <desc>At some time in either the past or the future... once again an evil force from the sky is descending down upon us. Its aim is to subjugate all human beings with its diabolic forces. Only those of us with a sound mind and a strong body will be able to endure this evil force and banish it from the face of the Earth.

Meanwhile, in another dimension not known to us mere mortals, is a heavenly haven enjoyed only by gods. These benevolent gods had been the proprietous protectors of mankind, but as time went on, our morals eroded and wickedness set in hard.

At this, the gods were terribly shocked and disconcerted, so they closed and locked the two doors of their sanctuary.

Ashura, the King of the Evil World, saw this as his golden opportunity. He sent in his minions of malice who faced no resistance in taking over the already debaucherous human race. The Earth was now under the spell of Ashura.

Saddened by this tragic event, the good gods gathered around and thought about what to do.

Said one kindly god:

"Ashura is trying to rule not only the Evil World but the lowly human world as well. Shouldn't we help these humans?"

Said another not-so-kindly god:

"Let them suffer!"

After much debate, they decided to try to save the humans.

Among the good gods Hyprion was the greatest. He ordered the assemblage:
 
"Choose four worthy humans on whom I will bestow my power. Through them we may save the Earth."

Suddenly, the clouds parted and with a flash of lightening Hyprion's supreme power and message were injected into the bodies of these four humans.

--From the Genesis Shadow Blasters instruction manual.

Directions:

Shadow Blasters has nine stages and you can choose the sequence of play of the first six stages. You have a choice of four Warriors. You will see their capabilities when you make your choice. Choose wisely.

I chose Don Knotts. Not too wise. Actually you can use the Start-Button to change Warriors during the game. If you are wondering the names of the standard weapons that each Warrior uses, so am I. Nothing that I can find gives them names. But they have great sounds and exciting effects.

Each Warrior has a Special Weapon that will kill all opponents on the screen when you press the C-Button. But each Warrior can use their Special Weapon only once in each round. So don't press the C-Button casually. Which means, if my math is right, that you actually have four Special Weapons in each round. Just change Warriors when you need some really heavy artillery. And if you make it through the round, voila: each Warrior gets a new, freshly minted, hot off the press Special Weapon!

Emblems: Taken when Certain Enemies Are Defeated:
     Red         Increases speed but can only use three at a time
     Blue        Increases jump height
     White       Nine will increase power
     Crimson     Adds one life
     Explosive   Complete recovery

Battle Sites and the Monsters Who Love Them:
     Mountain          Boss Skeltar
     Street            Boss Brutus
     Glen              Boss Kallus
     Harbor            Boss Tarman
     Forest            Boss Vallevo
     Future            Boss Gyrrina
     Wicked World      Boss Hawkus
     Heavenly Sky      Boss Wortan
     Space             Ashura 

Gameplay:

- Mechanics -

The game is a standard sidescrolling platform game. The player can control one character at a time and can choose from a pool of four characters. Each character is able to walk, jump, crouch, and fire a projectile weapon unique to that character. For the most part, the player is free to move forward and backward through a given level as desired. As the player progresses, characters become more powerful by picking up power-ups for the attributes of speed, jump, and power. Power-ups do not "roll over" into the character pool if the current character is at the maximum for the respective attribute - a character can only gain attribute points from a power-up if that character is in play when the power-up is collected.

- Characters -

There are four characters that player can choose from. Each character has 4 distinct stages to his or her weapon. The player can switch characters at any point during game play simply by going to the character select screen and choosing a different character. While this is a powerful asset, once a character dies, he or she cannot ever be revived. This effectively limits the total "lives" of the player to 4. Once the last character is dead, the game is over.

- Levels -

- Part I
Level selection screen.

The first part of the game consists of six levels: Mountain, Street, Glenn, Harbor, Forest, and Future. One unique aspect of this game is that these six levels may be played in any order the player desires.

- Part II

The second part of the game consists of two levels and a final battle, arranged in a predetermined order.

Controls:  

A Button: Use Weapon
B Button: Jump Up / Down
C Button: Use Special Weapon
Down: Warriors Kneel
Start Button: Start / Select / Change Warrior

Hints:

- Invincibility -
To be invincible, start a two player game, when one of the characters used run out of life points and their death animation begins, have the other player press the start button. (If player 1 dies, player 2 should press start or vice versa.) Then have the player choose that character again, the character will then be alive but have no life points, and thus be invincible.

Having destroyed the evil Neo Zeed empire, Shinobi (Joe Musashi) was not heard from again. Joe Musashi could now relax as his ninja skills and techniques were not needed. However, one day a school seemed to have been attacked and children were held as hostages. Kato, Joe's former martial arts student, when to investigate and try to help but was almost killed by the ones that over took the school: The Union Lizard.

Joe went to the hospital Kato had been put in, but Kato died before Joe arrived. All that Kato left was his faithful dog, called Yamamoto. Joe swore revenge to Kato's mother and left with Yamamoto to destroy the Union Lizard, which had now taken over almost all of New York and taken many hostages. Shinobi's mission was to rescue them all and destroy Union Lizard.

--From the Genesis Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi instruction manual.

Gameplay:

The gameplay is very similar to previous Shinobi games except with the addition of the dog as a game mechanic. The dog can harass enemies, allowing the player to kill them more easily. Some enemy types are designed in such a way that killing them is extremely difficult without the assistance of the dog. In the arcade version, the player can press down and attack to call the dog. It is not possible to summon the dog while standing up. When the dog is hurt, it shrinks into a puppy, incapable of attacking until the next power-up. In the home versions, the dog is always present, and must be given manual attack orders by holding down the attack button to charge a meter. If the dog is hurt, it automatically heals after a short amount of time.

Bombs (or hostages in the home versions) are scattered across the stage waiting to be disarmed. The goal of each stage is to disarm a certain number of bombs before facing the boss.

The player character's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of throwing stars, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. He can also perform "ninja magic," which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. A single power-up exists, which upgrades the shuriken into energy bolts and changes the close-range attacks to more powerful sword slashes.

The game contains 4 rounds divided into sub sections totaling 15 stages. The Sega Master System port is the shortest game among all versions. Every round has only one regular and one boss stage.

The arcade version of Shadow Dancer featured bonus stages where the PC will go up against a group of ninjas climbing down a building in the style of a first person shooter. The bonus stage is the same on all the ports except for Mega Drive version. In this version, the PC is depicted free-falling between two buildings while enemies wall-jump back and forth between them. The player moves left and right, throwing shuriken to hit the enemies before they jump past the top of the screen. The SMS version has both bonus rounds.

Hints:

- Earning 200,000 points -
To earn 200,000 points when you battle any boss (except Stavros) reduce your foe to within a flame or two of destruction, then stay out of reach until the last ten seconds. At the very last second, use ninja magic to destroy the boss.

- Practice on Any Stage -
Enter the following code at the Title Screen....
A + B + C - Start
A new option should appear allowing you to practice on any level

- Extra Life -
In the bonus round where you have to shoot the ninjas, you can either kill none or all ninjas. This will give you an extra life.

    <desc>Shadow of the Beast II finds the hero in half-beast form, wandering the lands of Karamoon in search of his kidnapped sister. She had been taken away from her mother's cottage by the dragon-form of the Beast Mage, Zelek, servant to Maletoth. Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as interactive, complicated foes. For example, a bottle of booze picked up at the Karamoon oasis must be given to the goblin jailer to free Aarbron from his cell. Only after Aarbron gives the old man his ring and his parchment does he obtain a spell powerful enough to harm Zelek.

Gameplay:

The game initially received praise for its high level cosmetics, although graphically inferior to the first game lacking the groundbreaking multi-layer paralax scrolling, it still provided much eye candy for the player and Tim Wrights soundtrack succeeded in creating a grim and sinister atmosphere, particularly the emotional 'death scene' music with its synth layer and sampled electric guitar melody which created a stunning tragic mood. Supposedly, many players died on purpose just to hear it. The booklet cover for Glasgow death metal band 'REGORGE' for their debut album "KINGDOMS OF DERISION" bore an uncanny influence to the death scene artwork.

The game itself is very difficult, and with no ability for the player to continue if killed, many felt that Psygnosis had neglected to consider the players who wanted it to be easier. For example, in several of the game's puzzles the player only received one attempt at solving it. This meant that if the player got the puzzle wrong, then he or she had to restart all over again. Another complaint was that the game was programmed in such a way as to allow players to get ahead of themselves by entering certain areas of the game without having first obtained the necessary equipment beforehand. Thus, many players believed they had no option but to cheat in order to see more than a fraction of it, by asking the first Pygmy to his right about "ten pints".

As in the first game, the cover art for Shadow of the Beast II was created by Roger Dean and the game was packaged with a promotional black T-Shirt that featured Dean's artwork.

    <desc>The year is 2050 and the megacorps rule by the power of information. everyone is on file in the global mainframe... everyone but you and a handful of "invisible" outlaws called shadowrunners. Move through the grim and magical realities of futuristic Seattle and uncover a diabolical plot that could destroy the world. Team up with spell casting mages, wire-headed deckers, or mythic orcs and trolls of the distant past. Take on a variety of shadowruns including: Cleaning up the streets, jacking into the Matrix for a big time cyber-heist or pulling off a risky "Corporate Extraction." Stalk the cities in real-time combat and glide through the virtual battlefield of the Matrix, where an encounter with Black ICE may be your last!

Gameplay:

Shadowrun offers the player an open style of gameplay, where one controls the main character, Joshua, in third person perspective during both exploration and combat. Battles are real time, and although of varying difficulty, tend to be relatively short. Initially, the player is restricted to a single area of the game, but shortly gains access to almost all other areas. Access to other areas is accomplished primarily by taxi, although various restrictions and other modes of travel also exist, such as requiring a visa or bypassing the visa check with the use of a helicopter.

As in most RPG videogames, the characters' skills and attributes can be improved. However, Shadowrun uses a unique "Karma" system, which allows full character customization. Karma, roughly equivalent to experience, is earned for successfully completing a run, killing enough enemies, or advancing the game's plot. Karma is then spent on specific stats as determined by the player.

To earn money and Karma, the player must participate in shadowruns, illegal jobs provided by pseudo-anonymous contractors who are, within the legal boundaries of their work, referred to simply as Mr. Johnsons. Mr. Johnsons usually are corporate liaisons who want their bosses' dirty work done without compromising them. All Mr. Johnsons work in backroom booths in different clubs and bars through the city. Depending on the Johnson, they will randomly offer one of four types of jobs: courier missions, Ghoul hunting, Matrix runs, or infiltrating a corporate headquarters. Different Mr. Johnsons have varying levels of difficulty and pay for their jobs, which can be influenced by the player's negotiation statistic.

At the start of the game, the player can choose for Joshua to be either a samurai, a decker, or a gator shaman. These only determine Joshua's beginning statistics and equipment; samurai begin focused on combat, deckers on use of the Matrix and electronics, and shamans on the use of magic. Over the course of the game, the player may choose to continue to focus on one particular skill or set of skills or branch out into other areas; however, only characters who choose to start as a shaman (and allied mages) can use magic and getting too many "cyberware" implants can reduce its effectiveness.

To help the player make things easier during hard shadowruns, Joshua can also recruit other characters to help him in his shadowruns. These are called shadowrunners, and can also be customized as Joshua can. The price of hiring a shadowrunner depends on the duration of the contract, as well as the runner's attitude toward the player. Shadowrunners can be hired for a single run or for a lifetime for ten times the price. The player can only directly control one character at a time; other characters (including Joshua) are controlled by the computer's AI.

The primary method of combat in Shadowrun is the use of firearms, although magic plays a significant role in combat in both an offensive and defensive capacity. Shadowrun keeps track of ammunition; if a character runs out they may have to resort to melee. The use of magic, on the other hand, is kept in check by damaging the player for casting high-level spells: the player can mitigate or even eliminate this through the use of items, or by reducing the success chance and/or power of the spell.

A variety of shops exist throughout the game, providing guns and modifications, cyberware, spells and spell upgrades, cyberdecks and utilities, and other miscellaneous items. In addition to the numerous shops in the game, the player can collect a variety of contacts who provide the player with information, services, or (frequently illegal) goods.

- The Matrix -

In tone with the Shadowrun pen-and-paper universe, certain characters can also explore the Matrix, a global computer network that can be accessed through cyberterminals. It is there that the player, in a third person perspective, can hack networked systems for various purposes. However, in order to do so, a series of intrusion countermeasures must be dealt with, the difficulty of which is proportionate to the system being attacked: the high-end systems of law enforcement and influential corporations will be significantly more difficult to break than that of a nameless hotel.

The cyberdeck, carried by Joshua, can be used by any shadowrunner, and like real computers has a variety of statistics, such as memory, storage, and loading speed. These can be improved individually through upgrades or all at once by purchasing a more advanced model. Primarily, the cyberdeck's use, aside from entering the Matrix, is to hold various utilities to hack the networks properly (such as Masking, Attack, and Analyzing programs) and to save data downloaded from the Matrix itself.
Shadowrun's Matrix system gameplay.

While inside the Matrix, the interface changes. The shadowrunner that entered it is replaced by a chromed character - referred to as persona, its reflection in the cyberworld - which navigates through the network. Networks are made up of a series of nodes: geometric shapes representing different facets of the system, such as the CPU or data stores. Each node has a different function: the CPU, for example, can cancel system alerts and crash the entire system. The difficultly of defeating a particular node is determined by its color: blue (unprotected node), green (weak and occasionally unprotected), orange (average), and red (strong).

Each node is (usually) protected by intrusion countermeasures called ICs (pronounced "Ice"). These are designed to forcibly dump the persona from the system by various means. ICs appear as different figures covering the nodes, and have different effects depending on their type. Trace IC, for example, will force the player out of the system after a certain period of time. Other forms will attempt to trigger alerts, thereby increasing the strength of other IC, or attack the player until they are forced to log out. Tar IC, which hide behind other forms of IC, can even permanently delete the player's utilities, effectively making further progress impossible.

Matrix runs consist of stealing or erasing data, or crashing a system via the CPU. During corporate infiltrations, the player can use internal cyberterminals to shut off the building's security, making the run easier. In addition to its role in shadowruns, the Matrix can be used as a direct source of income by pilfering data from systems and selling it. Files sell for a semi-random price based on the system of origin and difficultly rating of the node the data was stolen from; a single file can sell for as much as 10,000 nuyen, or turn out to be completely worthless.

- Gangs -

In Seattle, there are three local racial gangs that have well-defined territories and many influences on corporation affairs. These gangs are:

Halloweeners Humans Redmond Barrens    Yakuza
Eye-Fivers       Elves Penumbra District    Mafia
Orks             Orcs       Puyallup Barrens    Lone Star

The player can visit each of these gangs, and pay to speak with their leaders (or be asked to do so, depending on his reputation). There, he can ask for protection from the gangs' random attacks, as well as for the phone number of their allegiance bosses. After Joshua's reputation has been highly upgraded, and after he obtains the numbers of these bosses, he can contact the Yakuza and Mafia, and pledge loyalty to either one of them himself, obtaining specific benefits and exclusive items and discounts. Of course, after he sides with any of these criminal organizations, the rival gangs will attack him indiscriminately. On the other hand Lone Star, the government's police force, can't be contacted directly.

Hints:

- Cheat Menu -
Enter the following code at the Title Screen....
A - B - B - A - C - A - B
Then fo into the pocket secratary, below the Save/Load is a blank line. Go into that option and you can unlock some awesome cheats

- Lower Shadowrunner Hiring Costs at No Risk -
Complete a moderate or advanced Shadowrun that requires you to collect payment from the Johnson you contracted with. Then hire a shadowrunner for the short-term BEFORE collecting your payment. Upon receiving payment, the game will treat your hired shadowrunner like he/she successfully completed the contract with you, and will lower his/her hiring price anyway.

- Easy Stolen Package Corp Run -
Stolen packages are always randomly located in safes in corporate buildings. Each time you exit and reenter a corp building, the package relocates to a different safe.
That said, always take the Corp Run that requires you to retrieve a stolen package from Lone Star Security. The Lone Star building has a safe right next to the exit. Enter, check the safe, exit the building, and repeat the procedure until the package appears in that safe. It is the easiest Corp Run in the game.

    <desc>Mod Homepage: http://magus57.googlepages.com/shadowrunconversionmod

This is a mod for the Sega Genesis version of Shadowrun. It replaces all of the guns in the game either with real-life equivalents, or good alternatives to the in-game guns. It also makes a few minor changes detailed in the readme file.

It's also a complete change of the starting characters/races, along with their skills, attributes, and inventories. It may not make complete sense with the game's story, but in my opinion, it makes the gameplay more fresh.

Finally, it also changes a bit of the dialogue, and much of the menus and text. I will update the mod in the regard of modified dialogue every so often, whenever I feel I've made a worthwhile amount of changes.

More information in the readme. Mod is a single IPS patch.

While this mod is pretty much complete, I'm open to changes, especially if you can help me with some of the stuff mentioned in the readme. Just email me using the email in the readme.

Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye (not to be confused with Shanghai II, a Sega Game Gear game) is a Sega Mega Drive mahjong game and a sequel to Shanghai. It was only released in North America before seeing a European Virtual Console release.

Activision were slow to port this game to the Mega Drive. Its sequel, Dragon's Eye Plus: Shanghai III had appeared on the system in Japan three years earlier. According to former employee Tom Sloper, this was because they were not happy with the way that one turned out.</desc>

    <desc>Shaq Fu is a video game developed by Delphine Software and was released, among other systems, for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear. It is a fighting game which stars basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, who has accidentally been transported to "The Second World" and tasked with saving the land from a mythical sorcerer named Sett Ra. Though it is often praised for its fluid animation and vibrant graphics, the game has been the subject of ridicule for its nonsensical plot and bad controls.

The Sega Mega Drive version is notable for including five more playable characters and three new stages (The Lab, The Wasteland, and Yasko Mines) than its Super Nintendo Entertainment System counterpart. Unfortunately the story mode is shorter than in the SNES version, but as a bonus, players can also walk down the stairs past Gargoyle's Peak to fight a blue version of Beast. The Amiga port was based on the Mega Drive port, but features less music and background animation has been removed.

The Sega Game Gear version only has six selectable characters, no tournament mode, and no in-game voices.</desc>

Most monsters have double HP, 10% more attack and 10% more defense. Boss monsters are much harder. A comprehensive list of changes is included in the readme file.

Version 1.01 (released 6/30/2008) further improves the Zeon battle. It is compatible with saves from previous versions, provided those saves weren't made during the Zeon battle.

Shining Force, known as Shining Force: Kamigami no Isan in Japan, and otherwise known as Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention, is a turn-based tactical role-playing game released in 1992 published by Sega for the Mega Drive and the first of the tactical Shining series. Its development was a conjoined effort between the independent studio Climax Entertainment and Sonic Co., a Sega second party that was formed to create the previous Shining game, Shining in the Darkness.

It was rereleased several times for other systems and was remade in 2004 by Amusement Vision, renamed Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon, but this title is not considered to be canon to the series even though the story in common between the two titles seems to be more accurate than the original translation. Other media associated with this game include an encyclopedia, several game guides, a soundtrack release, a manga series (3 volumes) and The Curse of Zeon, a six part story published in Sonic the Comic (issues #73-78).</desc>

    <desc>Shining in the Darkness, called Shining and the Darkness in Japan, is a 1991 game by Sega and Climax Entertainment for the Sega Mega Drive. It is the first game in Sega's Shining series, but unlike most of the rest of the franchise, this one is a 3D dungeon-crawler RPG.

You are the son of Mortred, a warrior who was last seen near a dungeon known as the Labyrinth in the kingdom of Thornwood with the Princess Jessa. King Drake summons you to go find her, but just as that is about to happen, the evil Dark Sol appears and offers a ransom &#x2014; Mortred and the Princess for the kingdom. It is now up to you to save the two and defeat Dark Sol before he destroys King Drake instead.</desc>

    <desc>This is a strategy RPG based on the events of the famous classic Chinese novel "Shuihuzhuan" (Water Margins, also known as Outlaws of the Marsh), which tells the story of 108 heroes who fought against the corrupt regime of the Song dynasty (12th century). You take control of a group led by Song Jiang, a famous robber and the leader of the heroes, starting as the young Zhao He. Their town is under attack by imperial soldiers, and their long quest for freedom begins with this battle...

The game is a console-style turn-based strategy RPG. The game mainly consists of large battles, but you can also move your characters from top-down perspective, enter buildings, buy things, and travel from town to town on the world map. During the battles, you move your characters freely around the location and attack or cast magic when there are enemies in range.

    <name>The Simpsons: Bart's Nightmare</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>I can hear you saying: "Bart Simpson lost his homework? Suuure. What's his lame excuse this time?" Hey, I swear, I fell asleep! What a nightmare. Eight levels, each one scarier than the last, with villains like Homer Kong, Momthra, and Barney Gumble riding a pink elephant. I have to collect a page on each level, before I wake up and blow the whole assignment. You're my only hope, man.

Gameplay:

The game is split in two parts. The first is set on a street (probably Evergreen Terrace, but referred to as Windy World). Bart walks around and has to find pages of his homework while avoiding enemies such as post boxes, Lisa and various characters from the show. Bart can collect his skateboard, which acts as a power-up and temporarily increases the player's speed.

Principal Skinner occasionally appears and tries to dress Bart in his Sunday suit. If the player walks into Skinner, Bart will change appearance and become very slow and not be able to fire at enemies. The suit will also protect him from all enemies and will not take damage.

When a page is found in Windy World, the player must jump onto it, where Bart will shrink down on the page, and the player has to choose one out of a selection of two randomly chosen mini-games. The player must point Bart to one of the two color-coded doors to play a mini-game and retrieve a lost page of Bart's homework (if the player doesn't choose, Bart will automatically select the left-hand side door). The doors and games are:

    - The blue door: Bartman, where Bart flies over Springfield as a superhero. Along the way he fights many bosses, including Sherri and Terri, Barney Gumble, Waylon Smithers (you face him twice), and eventually Mr. Burns. Bart also receives power-ups from Apu in this level.

    - The orange door: Indiana Bart, where Bart must navigate the maze-like "Temple of Maggie"

    - The green door: Bartzilla, where Bart must stomp through the streets of Springfield, eventually climbing the Springfield State Building and fighting "Homer Kong" and "Momthra."

    - The yellow door: Itchy and Scratchy, where Bart must avoid the manic duo, as well as various other household objects that become enemies (the oven shoots fire, the telephone explodes, Pyro-Vacuums etc.) This is the only mini-game divided in two; Bart must play one half first and the other half next.

    - The violet door: A journey into Bart's blood stream, where Bart must use an air pump to inflate and destroy germs. This mini-game has a cameo appearance from Smiling Joe Fission (a character from the first-season episode "Homer's Odyssey").

The mini-games can be played in any order; the pages awarded will be 1 through 8 depending on the order they were retrieved.

Upon either losing all the lives in the respective mini-game (and not getting the page back) or completing the mini-game (and receiving the page as a reward), the screen will flash back to Bart's room at night, which shows the amount of points the player has and the number of pages collected, while Bart snores. The completed mini-game will not resurface later in the game. If there is only one mini-game left, both doors will be the same color.

The game ends when Bart dies (thus ending his dream) by losing all of his Zs (Windy World will be covered in a white fog, suggesting Bart is about to wake up) and taking damage one more time, or if he accomplishes all the mini-games. The first shot is a pic of Bart asleep at his desk in his room; if not all pages are recovered, Bart's homework will end in a scrawl, but recovering all pages will have the words "THE END" written on Bart's paper. Depending on how many mini-games Bart finishes and how many points he gets, he is awarded a letter grade. Bart will hold it up for the player to see, and then we see the family's reactions to Bart's grade by having the paper affixed to the refrigerator. An "F" grade would have the entire family upset at him, but a slightly higher grade would cause at least Homer to be pleased with Bart's work.

If one manages to beat all the mini-games and thus collect all the lost pages, the aforementioned room will turn from night to day, Bart will wake up on his own and the proper "ending" is shown.

This mini-game orientated gameplay gave the game an arcade style. Although much of the game could be categorized as platformer, some of the mini-games could fit in the shoot-em-up genre, particularly the Bartman and Bartzilla stages.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Hello, fellow humans! Barthlomew J. Simpson here, with a very important secret: SPACE MUTANTS ARE INVADING SPRINGFIELD! That's right, man! A buncha slimy, horrible, totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet! Pretty cool, huh? Anyway, yours truly is the only one who can see 'em 'cause of my X-ray glasses - so it's up to me to stop 'em! I've gotta spraypaint things, get radical on my skateboard, use my trusty slingshot, and in general behave like a nuisance, man. Plus, with evil dudes like Nelson the bully and Sideshow Bob getting in my way, it's a good thing I've got the rest of the Simpsons to help me out! So if you're a decent person, a patriot, and somebody who cares about this sorry planet, you'll do the right thing. Save the Earth! BUY THIS GAME! Thanks, man!

Gameplay:

In the single player game, Bart Simpson is the only one who knows of the aliens' secret plan and he has to stop them from collecting the items they need to build their weapons to take over the world. In each level, Bart must collect a certain number of a specific item (e.g., purple objects, hats, balloons, exit signs, nuclear rods), before he meets up with a boss at the end of the level.

The bosses, like the levels, are familiar to fans of the Simpsons animated series and some of the television humor does appear in the game: in the first level Bart can make a prank call to Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple shirt.

Although Bart fights aliens in this game, he does not fight Kang and Kodos, the two aliens that appear regularly on the show in Treehouse of Horror and other episodes.

- Equipment -

Bart is able to utilize a variety of items in the game.

    - Xray Glasses: The major defensive weapons are x-ray glasses that reveal which of the Springfield citizens are human and which are aliens in disguise (similar to the film They Live). Jumping on the aliens will force them to flee the human body and leave behind an icon that begins to spell one of the Simpson's family names (i.e. Homer, Maggie, Marge or Lisa). If Bart manages to jump on enough aliens to spell out the family member's name, that family member will appear to assist him in defeating the boss. However, if Bart jumps on a human being, he will take damage.

    - Spray Paint: Bart uses spray paint in Level 1 to turn a variety of purple items red.

    - Slingshot: Bart uses a slingshot in Level 3 to hit balloons, and for certain carnival games.

    - Dart Gun: The dart gun is used in the Museum. It can hit exit signs and is the only fire arm that can stun enemies.

    - Wrench: The wrench is used in level one to activate fire hydrants.

    - Cherry bombs: Can startle animals when dropped on the ground. However, the player runs the risk of summoning angry, damage-inflicting pitbull dogs if used.

    - Rockets: Rockets are toy fireworks that can be used to launch at signs, windows, and other items.

    - Key: Can be used as a warp item in Level 1.

    - Whistle: The whistle is used to get Grandpa Simpson to give you coins in Level 1. However, the player runs the risk of summoning angry, damage-inflicting pitbull dogs if used.

    - Doughnuts: Boxes of these are found only in the final level. If used, Homer will eliminate any enemies on the screen.

    - Other Items: Bart is only able to withstand two direct hits per life, and after three lives it is Game Over. Collecting Krusty icons give an extra life, Bart can also collect coins to purchase weapons or to gain an extra life (after reaching 15 coins, but ten are deducted upon receiving the extra life). Busts of Jebadiah Springfield give Bart a brief few seconds of invincibility.

- Levels -

- Springfield

Bart first must collect, hide, or destroy all purple things he finds: trash cans, flower pots, doors, hydrants, and signs. Special appearances are made here by Grampa Simpson, Moe Syzlak, and Jimbo Jones. The final boss of the level is Nelson Muntz, who attacks Bart with water balloons. However, Bart is aided by Maggie if he collects the letters of her name. Bart also rides his skateboard halfway through this level.

- Springfield Shopping Center

Inside the mall, Bart collects all kinds of hats, from top hats, to helmets, to baseball caps. Unlike the previous level, there are three mini-bosses. Each one is an alien that attacks Bart in sync with the floor he is on (the first attacks him with candy, the second in a shoe, the last one with magic cards). The player will have to avoid obstacles such as living sneakers, giant marshmallows and doughnuts, and towels. Ms. Botz, a thief disguised as a babysitter, is the boss. Marge helps Bart in the mall.

- Krustyland

Bart must collect balloons in the amusement park. Some are stationary, others are flying. Here Bart can play carnival games and make lots of extra lives. Lisa is Bart's helper in this level. The boss is Sideshow Bob, who Bart defeats by stomping on his feet.

- Museum

The museum is comprised of museum displays-some of which hold useful items. Like the mall, the museum has three mini-bosses that correspond to a specific display. The first is a giant plant in the jungle area. In the Egypt display, there is a mummy, and a Tyrannosaurus-Rex is at the end of Prehistoric. Dr. Marvin Monroe is the boss, and Homer will help Bart defeat him with enough evidence.

- Power Plant

Bart must collect a number of rods which he puts in the nuclear reactor. They are scattered all over the plant. In this level, all the Simpsons help Bart out in various ways: Lisa gives him door combinations, Marge carries rods to the basement for him, Homer stomps all enemies if fed donuts, and Maggie wins the game.

Hints:

- Unlock Sound Test -

Shoot the E in the Kwik-E-Mart sign with a rocket. If done correctly, a Krusty face will appear and you should be able to access the sound test.

    <desc>Krusty's Fun House (also released as Krusty's Super Fun House) is a video game based on the cartoon series The Simpsons. The player directs small rats to an extermination area through complicated maze-like levels. The game was released in 1992-1993 for the Amiga, NES, IBM PC, Sega Master System, Game Boy, Super NES, and Mega Drive/Genesis. Originally named Rat-Trap, it was developed by Fox William for the British software house Audiogenic, who licensed it to Acclaim Entertainment, the US-based publishers of a range of games based on The Simpsons. Acclaim published the console versions, and sub-licensed the home computer versions to Virgin.

Gameplay:

The player controls Krusty the Clown who must navigate through his Krusty Brand Fun House. Each level is a puzzle in which a number of rats must be exterminated. Using different objects and obstacles, Krusty must create a path for the rats to follow, and guide them towards an extermination device. Other creatures such as snakes and flying pigs attempt to hinder Krusty's progress by injuring him; he must throw pies in order to defeat them.

In each stage the extermination devices are run by a different character, including Bart, Homer, Corporal Punishment, and Sideshow Mel.

The game has a password system, notably all the passwords are the names of actual Simpsons characters. The only exception is the best password in the SNES game, which is "_Joshua_", a reference to the film WarGames.

    <name>The Simpsons: Virtual Bart</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Bart Simpson is stuck in a virtual reality machine. You'll help him explore and defeat six different worlds or Bart's brain will be fried with sensory overload. As Dino Bart, you will have to create mayhem in a prehistoric world. Doomsday Bart will battle Nelson in a post-apocalyptic Springfield. Experience the thrills of a waterslide as you go sliding down Mt. Splashmore. Finally, become Baby and use a diaper-chute to float to safety. On all of these adventures, characters from the television series are along for the ride including Barney, Principal Skinner, Milhouse, and Chief Wiggum. Join Bart as he goes on a wild ride through virtual reality in VIRTUAL BART.

Gameplay:

At a science fair, Bart wanders into a virtual reality exhibit and must pass all the "virtual worlds" (levels) to escape the machine. Passing a set of virtual worlds grants an ending sequence, and completing all the levels without losing all lives remaining wins the game. The format is similar to the previously released Bart's Nightmare, save for the lack of a hub world from which the levels were accessed. Gameplay for most of the levels consisted of standard platforming elements; others took advantage of the SNES' Mode7 abilities. The levels were as follows:

- "Dinosaur": Bart is a dinosaur that somewhat resembles a velociraptor, on top of Mt. Springfield in the primeval era. The player must survive the various platforming hazards while fighting off other dinosaurs and neanderthalic versions of various Simpsons characters. Homer, as a caveman, is particularly persistent, and appears as a boss along with Moe, attempting to knock Bart into a freezing lake. Sending the two into the lake ends the stage; an ending is played of a frozen Homer on display at the Springfield Museum of Natural History, sighing "D'oh" as Dr. J. Loren Pryor passes by with a plateful of donuts.

- "Baby": Bart "relives" his infancy, escaping from his bedroom at the Simpsons' residence to explore. The player must guide Baby Bart through complex platforming sequences while avoiding hazards and animals. Bart eventually ends up in a live circus act, and is safely launched back home via cannon without his parents realizing his absence.

- "Pig": Bart is an escaped pig at Krusty the Klown's pork factory. The player must rescue Bart's swine brethren while again surviving platforming hazards and fending off clowns and corporate thugs. After defeating the owners of the factory, an ending sequence plays of Pig-Bart freeing all the captive pigs.

- "Water Slide": Bart slides down a massive, surreal waterside tube at a waterpark, dodging hazards and other waterpark patrons. The slide sometimes forks, with only one path the correct one. Taking the wrong fork will either force the player back (courtesy of a pudgy Homer blocking the way), or ejected from the slide into a bizzare death such as falling off a cliff or being eaten by a lion. Reaching the end of the level grants an ending sequence of a triumphant Bart soaking the twins Sherri and Terri. Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish makes a cameo as both a hazard and a marker for the level's progression meter.

- "Vandal": Bart, from his hiding spot, must hurl tomatoes and eggs at his Springfield Elementary classmates, striking each one. Running out of throwing objects with classmates remaining results in failure, as does hitting any passing adult (the exception is Principal Skinner, who can be hit in the posterior when he is bent over).

- "Post-Apocalypse": A spoof of the Mad Max films, Bart is a road warrior attempting to survive a post-nuclear holocaust Springfield. The level plays similarly to such game classics as Road Rash and Mach Rider. The player bikes through a highway while fighting off attacks from bullies Jimbo Jones, Kearney, and Dolph, each in their own vehicles. Completing the level sees Bart return to his home on Evergreen Terrance. Bart's family is revealed to have been long dead, reduced to a group of skeletons on the living room couch. An uncaring Bart shoves their bones out of the way as Krusty's post-apocalyptic TV show is about to air ("Hey, surviving kids!").

If the player runs out of lives, game over occurs (with Bart getting embarrassing nausea from the virtual-reality machine). If the player successfully passes all of the levels, a final ending sequence shows Bart safely escaping the machine, while a gullible Homer tries the machine himself to immediate disaster.

    <desc>Skeleton Krew is an action game for the Sega Mega Drive. It uses an isometric perspective.

The game takes place in the year 2062. A baddy named Moribund Kadaver has assumed control of a cryogenics plant near Monstro City. Kadaver is apparently a former mortician who has dabbled in cryogenics ever since he purchased Deadly Enforcement Aggressive Destruction Incorporated, aka DEAD Inc. Now he has the power to unleash mutants called Psykogenix on the population of Monstro City! The Military Ascertainment Department (MAD) has decided to call upon the world's most vicious mercenaries: the Skeleton Krew.

Skeleton Krew has you choosing between three members of the deadly organization: Spine, Joint, and Rib. The object of the game is to make it through four planets on your way to stop Kadaver's nefarious plans.</desc>

    <desc>An unreleased basketball game by Tiburon (now EA Tiburon).

The game is less visually impressive than the early build of Barkley 2, but can handle many more players on screen, and features different locales (though they look mostly identical).

The game also has a slightly better soundtrack, and intelligible voices that can be clearly recognized.

    <desc>Slap Fight, also known as Alcon, is a 1986 vertically scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Toaplan and published by Taito. It takes its inspiration from Xevious (being a vertical scroller) and Gradius (from which it borrows its power-up system). The game takes place in an Earth-type environment with metallic, land-based enemies; some are mobile armor and others are fortifications embedded in natural terrain.

Enemies always appear in the same location, at every new game or wrap of the map. Certain enemies leave power-up stars upon destruction. Collecting these stars "turns on" an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen and moves a lit cursor through the list of power-ups described below. If any power-up is lit, but a ship is lost before a power-up could be selected, the star is "carried over" and the Speed block is lit on the next life.

Single hits to the unshielded main ship destroy it, and the player loses any accumulated upgrades including Speed. This can make successive lives difficult to keep in the heat of battle.

This game does not support continues with extra credits, and is believed to be endless; that is, after the final boss, gameplay resumes at the beginning of the play map but at successively higher difficulty due to enemies shooting faster and more frequently. This has been tested to at least three "wraps."

    <desc>The year is 2550 A.D., and fighters from around the universe come to the fight palace of the champion, known as Mondu.

In 1989, Activision releases Tongue of the Fatman for the PC. (also known as Mondu's Fight Palace) Although it was on-par with the original Street Fighter, it was underrated. (of course, Street Fighter II blew it away) During the craze of what SF2 caused, Sanritsu Denki releases a Megadrive port, known as Fat Man, in 1990. Razorsoft releases it as Slaugher Sport for the Sega Genesis in 1991.

Although it was the only fighting game for the Genesis at that time, it's still not a decent fighting game, even at their standards.

Although you have the ability to buy health, strength, and various magic abilities to fight your way through the tournament. It isn't easy. In fact, good luck getting through the second match as Rex. Though, it might be interesting when playing with a friend.

Directions:

Control Rex (or one of the others, if you use a code) as you fight your way through the Slaughter Sport tournament, proving your skills and becoming a hero.

    <desc>Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs' laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.

A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield. There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level.

Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded.

The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.

    <desc>Socket, known as Time Dominator 1st in Japan, is a platform game released for the Mega Drive in 1993. It was developed and published by VIC Tokai and stars a time travelling duck named Socket, built to "fight" in the "mascot wars" initiated by the rivalry between Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The game was released in Japan and North America, but not in Europe.

Socket borrows many elements from Sonic the Hedgehog and its sequels, causing it to be labelled as a "Sonic clone". Like Sonic there is an emphasis on speed, with the game offering several "High Speed Areas" in an attempt to woo fans of Sega's game. There are also "labyrinth" areas, which have a greater emphasis on exploration of the level. Items are collected by destroying capsules, similar to Sonic, and a time attack mode is offered.</desc>

    <desc>In the year 3300, human technology advances drastically when a super computer known as GCS-WT is created after an AI circuit is developed and utilized. GCS-WT's purpose was to ultimately unify every human society using the power of diplomacy, but GCS-WT has other plans: rather than unify mankind, GCS-WT turns societies into a dystopia after becoming an all-powerful dictator who controls all military action as it sees fit and oppressess mankind of various liberties; anyone who spoke against GCS-WT's will did not live very long.

Only one man was the most successful in running a campaign against GCS-WT: a scientist known as Edwin Feace. Feace had fled SOL completely and stationed himself near a recently discovered planet dubbed Cilius that awaited colonization. It was there that Feace secretly established a resistance group against GCS-WT and developed a multi-directional, dual-occupant space fighter called the Sol-Feace. The Sol-Feace was Edwin's plan to use against the GCS-WT and any who fell under its militaristic order in hopes of releasing human suppression. However, Edwin was assassinated under GCS-WT's command before the ship could be mass produced in a violent manhunt in space. Two survivors escaped the destruction that followed Edwin:

    - Eric Williams - A young pilot prodigy who was selected by Edwin to control the Sol-Feace and to organise its armaments.

    - Misao Hatanaka - The cannon-gunner of the Sol-Feace, Misao is a weapons engineer who, with her knowledge in computers, contributed to the Sol-Feace project.

Together, the two go on to continue Edwin's mission: pilot the Sol-Feace and destroy GCS-WT.

Gameplay:

Players pilot the Sol-Feace in a fight against strategic enemy fighters. Players use a dual cannon pick-up weapon that can fire shots in diagonal angles. The cannons can be positioned to fire straight or diagonally only when the ship is not firing its weapons and can fire different shots depending on the weapon.

Weapon power-ups include the following:

    - Blaster - Standard vulcan type weapon.

    - Wide Blaster - Bi-directional weapon that can fire from the top or bottom of the ship under each cannon.

    - Melt ray - Laser weapon, fires long beams of semi-powerful lasers.

    - Burn Bullet - A stream of rocket-fire that explodes on impact and can spread partially behind the ship against ground forces as the shots bow outward when fired. Obviously, the strongest weapon in the game, but not entirely the fastest.

- Levels -

The levels of Sol-Feace take the players across two galaxies on various seek and destroy missions.

    - Level 1: Sirius - The largest colony of humans was set here, but GCS-WT's order left the vastly populated colony a cloud of metallic parts floating adrift in space.

    - Level 2: Sirius Moon Weapon Facility - Simply put, a large weapon facility used by GCS-WT.

    - Level 3: Artificial Sun - A sun made entirely by GCS-WT for an unknown purpose.

    - Level 4: Microcosm P-1 - An unused cruise ship that was thrown into battle once Sol-Feace continued its strikes.

    - Level 5: A Station on Pluto - A supposedly weak space station that's under construction set near Pluto.

    - Level 6: The Moon Amalthea - The strongest base developed under GCS-WT's rule set on Amalthea (moon) as the primary defense against any outside forces (in this case, the Sol-Feace).

    - Level 7: Earth - an unknown location in which GCS-WT is stationed.

Hints:

- Level Skip -
To skip levels while you are playing, enter the ninety-nine lives and level select code. Then hit A, B and C during gameplay to skip a level.

- Ninety-nine lives and Level Select -

High Risk. High Pay. Deadly Play. It's eight miles of bubbling mud pits to the compound. Once inside, you're up against the deadly Chaos Engine. It has the power to create any kind of trap, any type of monster. If you can make it back, you'll never need to work again. Going solo would be lethal. Who to take? The Thug and his sawed-off? That Mercenary with the Gatling gun? Be sure to take the right cover man 'cause this could either be your last day of work or your last day of life.

Gameplay:

- Characters and weaponry -

The player(s) choose two mercenaries from the group of six to take on the task of defeating the mad Baron Fortesque and the Chaos Engine itself. In one-player mode, the computer artificial intelligence controls the second player (in a co-operative fashion), so that one never has to fight the chaos alone.

The predetermined weapons of the six "heroes" are as follows:

The Cannon (Navvie) and the Rifle (Brigand) act like like a powerful forward shot. At their full power both weapons will have a tight 4 bullet spread.

The Shotgun (Thug) and the Machine Gun (Mercenary) are similar to one another. The shot gun has a wider spread, shoots more bullets in one go but and a slower rate of fire. The Machine gun however has a continuous fire rate and closer spread.

The Pistol (Gentleman) and the Lightening Gun (Preacher) are different to the other weapons. They do not fire bullets, except they have their own "shots," exclusive to each other. They both pass through monsters which in turn can cause damage to any monster or spawn device behind it. The Pistol's Flame shot can be upgraded to fire two shots at once where as the Lightning Gun's Lightning will only have one shot that eventually grows to a larger size.

Sub-Weapons/items can also be bought in the shop, as well as stats and lives, after every 2 stages. Each character will have one Sub-weapon/items each at the start. Only 2 Sub-weapons/items can be held at one time (one for each character) which, in 1 player mode, can be swapped by pressing the space bar. Holding down the fire button activates a Sub-weapon/items.

Sub-weapons/items include screen clearing sticks of dynamite, Bombs, Maps, First Aid Boxes, Molotov Cocktails and 8 way bursts of bullets. Items will similar effects are found in game as well.

- Levels of play -
There are four worlds, each consisting of four levels. The worlds (in order of visitation) are "Forest", "Workshops", "Fortesque Mansion", and "Sewers", each with its own dynamic industrial music score. The players must traverse through each level, picking up power-ups, gold and keys to pass through the various puzzles and mazes. A number of "nodes" must be activated via weapon fire to open the final doors at the end of the level. Secret routes and hidden items are plentiful along the way. At the end of every second level the player has a chance to spend their collected riches to upgrade their weapons, increase the number of hit points of their character, purchase new items and improve other character attributes. Finally, at the end of the sewers the players will face up to the Chaos Engine itself in a last battle. Upon its destruction, the narrator of the game is revealed to be the Baron himself, trapped within the machine and studded with implants. His final words are: "I have guided you here so that you might set me free. The Chaos has ended... you will be remembered."

    <desc>Highlights for version 3.0:

- All level layouts edited (some complete; others pending)

- Each character now has a unique set of moves (though Sonic and Shadow share homing attack)

- Most levels (not all) have a small intro, ala S3K, where they perform some sort of action when starting the level. i.e, running in from the left.

- Loads of music edits

- There is now a "preferences" screen, where you can customize certain aspects of the game (suggestions are welcome)

- Cheat codes have been changed - figuring them out will grant you access to a new, special level select (which is a bit buggy - just don't hit left/right on zone selections =P)

- "Original Mode" allows you to play the original levels from Sonic the Hedgehog, using all of the additions from Sonic Megamix (such as bugfixes, moves, preferences, etc). There is also a seperate save slot for a character's original mode.

- Title screen demos have been edited. Credits demos have not.

- Super forms have been added.

- Elemental shields, ala S3K, have been added.

- Credits have been edited; each character has a unique end pose on the ending sequence.

- Various other changes. See the Wiki page for more info.

This is, pending future changes, considered a "complete" release. Future changes are planned, but not assured. More information can be found on the Manual/Wiki page, located here: http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_1_Megamix

    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Sonic 2 Delta II is one of those rare hacks that is actually better than the original game. The original zones, with a few exceptions, are untouched; this hack restores zones that were cut during development. While two of these zones (Wood and Hidden Palace) are available in the prototype ROM floating around the ?net, they are in an unfinished and nearly unplayable state. One zone, Dust Hill, was restored based on a single mock-up screenshot; Winter Hill was based on an interview. Even Casino Night, which received a makeover since its beta state, has been restored to its former (very pink) look. The only zone that is incomplete in this hack is Genocide City, which is merely Chemical Plant with a different background and palette.

In addition to restoring cut zones, the hack adds a few new features: The ring counter now shows how many rings remain in a zone, the level select menu has been updated to allow access to the new zones, some Sonic 3 graphics have been ported, and even Knuckles has been ported from Sonic &amp; Knuckles!

This is one of those hacks that simply must be played, its only flaws are the somewhat amateur-feeling level designs for the new zones and the fact it does not work on the real Genesis hardware.

    <desc>Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island, known as Sonic 3D Blast in the US, was released on the Sega Genesis and Saturn in 1996, and also released later on the PC. In the opinions of many, this was a fairly mediocre Sonic game, due to the sluggish gameplay and rather boring aspects that haunt the stages of the game. The music in the Genesis version, however, is widely considered to be some of the greatest in the series, and has spawned numerous remixes across the web. Co-composer Jun Senoue was later brought back to do the music for Sonic Adventure, often using arrangements of Sonic 3D's music.

It was the third to last first-party Saturn game released in Japan, where it was a Saturn exclusive until the release of Sonic Mega Collection which finally brought the Mega Drive version to Japan. It was also the last Sonic game for the Mega Drive.</desc>

    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Sonic Crackers, also known by the name in the ROM header, Sonic Studium, is an early Sonic the Hedgehog prototype game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It is believed to have been an engine test, containing essentially multiple different game engines, swapped out in realtime using code written into RAM. The concepts, engine and various other materials in the prototype was subsequently implemented in the Sega 32X game Knuckles' Chaotix. Sonic Crackers was not a commercial release but is widely distributed on the Internet.

Gameplay:

The game has Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings. This would later become the idea for Knuckles' Chaotix for the Sega 32X.

The ROM has two "adventure" levels, one of which appears multiple times with a different palette each time, and two "field" levels. One is highly reminiscent of the Techno Tower Zone level in Knuckles' Chaotix, the objective being to make it to the top of the screen; if this is done or three full minutes elapses on the clock, the Sonic 1 "game over" music plays and the player is brought to the first field level, featuring a clouded background and a waterfall.

The "field" levels are only half-complete; there is no collision set, and Sonic can walk anywhere on the field with impunity. If the player pauses and hits a button, the game goes to a carnival-like level reminiscent of Chaotix' Speed Slider Zone that goes around in an infinite loop. After one minute has elapsed, the circus level ends and another "field" level begins. After the player pauses and hits another button, he or she is brought back to the Techno Tower Zone level with a different palette, four in all.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Sonic Gaiden is a 2003 fan-made hack of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.

This hack is significant in the Sonic ROM-hacking community for several reasons. First, it's a hack of a Sonic 1 title; at the time of its release, such hacks were slightly rarer as Sonic 2 was the most frequently hacked Sonic game. Secondly, it is a hack of the Japanese Sonic 1 ROM; the U.S. Sonic 1 is more commonly used, but the Japanese revision has added features such as scrolling clouds and rippling water. Thirdly, the hack allows the option to play as either Sonic or as Mighty the Armadillo, who became popular as a founding member of the Chaotix crew and as a playable character in SegaSonic the Hedgehog. In addition, the hack includes new levels with new artwork and separate endings for each character.

The hack is a co-operative effort between two noteworthy hackers in the community, Yuski the Dog and Esrael Neto. Esrael is most famous for his work on Sonic 2 Delta, a hack of the Sonic 2 Beta ROM which re-coded all the incomplete elements and restored deleted levels. Yuski had created a previous hack in 2000 called Mighty the Armadillo which was a sprite and palette hack of the U.S. Sonic 1 ROM. Sonic Gaiden was born when Esrael e-mailed Yuki a Sonic 1 ROM-hack with both Sonic and Mighty playable.

The difference between Sonic and Mighty is purely cosmetic. Choosing between the two is simply a matter of which sprites will be loaded. Therefore, not only do they both have identical abilities, but Mighty's trademark moves such as spin-dashing and wall-kicking are absent.

It is worth noting that Mighty may have been an original design prototype for Sonic. Despite only having appeared in a couple of Sonic games, he has gained a small fan following.

    <desc>For the first time!

For all of you who will never be able to play Sonic Jam, I have ported Sonic 1's Easy mode. Easy mode uses completely different level layout. And you can really feel this is a new game.

    <desc>Sonic Jam 6 is a hack of Super 1998 Mario 2, an unlicensed clone of Super Mario Bros. for the Sega Megadrive that uses tiles appropriated from Super Mario All-Stars.

The Mario sprite of Super 1998 Mario 2 was replaced by Sonic the Hedgehog, who is red without a mushroom and blue with one. The title screen was also changed to feature Sonic, as well as the "intermission" screens that show you the remaining lives and the "Game Over" screen. Mario's name above the score readout was also changed to Sonic's. Curiously, the large Mario head in the underground bonus areas still remains. Controls are also modified; only the C button allows Sonic to jump and A shoots fireballs (if Sonic has grabbed a Fire Flower.)

The game originated from China.

This game is not to be confused with the legitimate Sega Saturn game Sonic Jam, although it does use an almost identical title screen.

When running on the popular emulator Gens or the outmoded emulator Genecyst, the game freezes on world 4-1, as the Lakitu throws so many Spinies that the game freezes. This is a bug in Gens, and does not occur on Kega Fusion or on a real Genesis.

    <desc>Placing the first Sonic game, or most other Genesis/Mega Drive games, into the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge will display a screen                              depicting Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik underneath scrolling text that repeats "No way? No way!". By pressing the A, B and C buttons together, a minigame based on the Chaos Emerald bonus levels is unlocked, called "Blue Sphere". There are over 100 million unique levels. The last level, "Special Stage", repeats itself once the level is beaten. Only by locking the original Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Compilation in the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cart can one play through all the stages. The other Genesis/Mega Drive games will only play one level each, which will infinitely repeat. Despite being near randomly generated, the levels are playable for the most part, even if many bits and pieces of levels get recycled. On another note, some levels may be nearly impossible to complete while others are not as difficult.

    <desc>Sonic &amp; Knuckles is the direct sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 on the Sega Mega Drive. Released in the same year as its predecessor, the game was the first to boast the ability of "Lock-On Technology," which allowed the game to interact with past Sonic the Hedgehog titles. It is the second half of what some consider the greatest Sonic game of all (Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles) and the third part in the "Death Egg Saga", which is currently ongoing in Sonic the Hedgehog 4.

It was also the last Sonic game led by Director Hirokazu Yasuhara. Being the swan song not just for Yasuhara but ultimately being the final Sonic game released through the Sega Technical Institute, many people consider the game to be the end of the "classic" series begun with the first Sonic the Hedgehog.</desc>

    <desc>Sonic 1 Pixel Perfect is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis by JcFerggy and NovaWizard. The hack features new extended layouts and art, custom loops and tubes, dynamic palettes for the acts, and a complete GHZ layout (with edited boss) as of the first beta release. 

General:

Sonic 1 Pixel Perfect started as an art-based hack by JcFerggy. The idea was to give the player an experience that kept close to the original formula, without adding any major ASM changes.

History:

Around October of 2007, the team at the time was trying to go in different directions. Thorn and DNXDelta were planning a whole dynamic music system, with a strategy oriented layout, while JcFerggy and NovaWizard had more of a passive idea in mind. Either way the group split. JcFerggy and NovaWizard continued to work on Pixel Perfect while Thorn and DNXDelta started work on a Sonic 2 hack, Sonic 2 Retro Remix.

Currently:

As of now, Pixel Perfect is still a work in progress, but progress is slow since JcFerggy has other things to do. The main priority is art, but sometimes JcFerggy likes to mess around with the loops and tubes. Several people have offered to help out, but things like that will revealed at the next release/big update.

    <desc>Sonic 1 Remastered is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis by Puto. Unlike most hacks, Remastered isn't a level art/palette hack as much as an "additional features" hack done in ASM. One of the major additions to the game is added with the choice of using Sonic, Tails or Knuckles throughout the game (selecting a character is done at the title screen.) All characters have the Spin Dash, Sonic has the peelout and high speed dash (an attack that sends you rolling forward at a specific speed when you press A or B) while Tails flies/swims, and Knuckles climbs/glides.

Ports of music from the other 16-bit Sonic games and original compositions are featured in each level. 

Features: 

- Multiple characters

- Speed limit removed

- New zone title/results font based on Sonic 3 title/results font

- Some art from Sonic 3k, such as the Sonic and Tails sprites, rocks, starposts, monitors etc

- Spike damage behavior changed to that of Sonic 2

- Abilities gained as Chaos Emeralds are collected (might be subject to change)

- Timer ends after defeating a boss instead of after opening egg prison

- Super Sonic/Tails/Knuckles added

- The ability to carry leftover rings into the next act

- The ability to save your progress to SRAM

- Transitions between different zones

- Elemental Shields from Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and the Insta-Shield.

- An options screen with a character choosing, shield style, sprite style, soundtrack switching, auto rolling switching, retain rings switching, and a sound test.

    <desc>Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball is a pinball game (using Sonic as a ball) combined with the storyline of the Sonic the Hedgehog. The games title is a pun on pinball and Sonic's famous spin move. It is the only official game to incorporate the characters and setting of SatAM, and one of only two for Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (the other being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine).

The plot revolves around the Veg-O-Fortress, Dr. Robotnik's new mass-roboticization facility built in and around the Mt. Mobius volcano. Sonic must use the fortress' special "Pinball Defense System" to his advantage, working his way up from the bottom of the volcano's interior by stealing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable, destroying the doctor's boss guardians and, eventually, taking out the massive roboticizer itself, the Veg-O-Machine. The grand finale is at a launch hangar built around the volcano's crater, as Robotnik attempts to escape Mt. Mobius in a rocketship before it erupts.

The game is unique as it was coded entirely in the C programming language when the norm was assembly.</desc>

    <desc>Its heyday may be long gone, but the Sega Genesis is still holding on. Amongst certain retro fans, the interest in the old 16-bit console is still strong. 2008 alone has seen the second commercial release of a Genesis game in our millennium (Super Fighter Team's Legend of Wukong) and the first European Mega Drive Championship, while the first exclusive Genesis release in a decade, Pier Solar, is expected to be shipped in the near future.

Nowadays, these new releases have become possible because of fans, enthusiasts, and tinkerers who have devoted their passion to the Geneses as the console of their choice. They've decided to not only play the games on the machine, but to also look into it to see what makes them tick. Up to today though, mostly working with emulators and communicating over the Internet, the Sega Genesis still has a very active homebrew scene.

One particular field of interest for these hackers, of course, is the forerunner of its success: Sonic The Hedgehog! It was he who gave the Genesis the edge in the console wars of the early nineties. The Sonic games on the Genesis are among the most lauded and acclaimed video games of that decade, so it comes to little surprise then, that the Blue Blur has found a particular interest amongst hackers.

Hack Description: 

This is a hack which fixes the "Spike bug" and also implements a near perfect rendition of the Spindash. There is animation while doing the spindash like in the later games. The only thing missing is the dust underneath.

Special thanks to Lightning &amp; FraGag for their guides on how to implement this.

For some reason it doesn't like opening in a level editor, I don't know why. However, if you decompress the original Sonic 1 and decompress this ROM, you can open those decompressed original Sonic 1 files, then after you edit them, recompress them into the edit? I Think.

    <desc>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third game in the classic series released on the Sega Mega Drive and the second in the "Death Egg Saga" that started in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, continues in Sonic &amp; Knuckles, and ends at Sonic the Hedgehog 4. Introducing Knuckles the Echidna and further expanding the world of Sonic the Hedgehog, the game (when connected to its direct sequel through the use of "Lock-On Technology") is considered to be one of the best in the entire franchise, and has become the standard that every two-dimensional Sonic title has been compared to.

The game was also met with a huge publicity campaign, connected to the date it was released in the United States. February 2nd, traditionally known as Groundhog Day, was renamed "Hedgehog Day" by Sega. In the U.K., Sega of Europe approached the pop group Right Said Fred to create a song suitable for radio play, which resulted in the Sonic-inspired single "Wonderman".</desc>

    <desc>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the highly successful sequel of the original Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive. Put into development not long after the completion of the first game, the title would go on to become one of the most successful video games of all time, selling millions of units and cementing the franchise as a cultural phenomenon in the west. Introducing Miles "Tails" Prower in the role he was created for, the game was released worldwide on November 24th, 1992. Dubbed "Sonic 2sday," the simultaneous release was an unusual move for the time. The game eventually replaced the original Sonic the Hedgehog as the default pack-in title for the Mega Drive, being bundled with the redesigned Mega Drive II model.</desc>

    <desc>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first game in the long-running series by video game publisher and former console maker Sega. First released in the United States and Europe on June 23rd, 1991, it was the premier outing for the character of Sonic the Hedgehog and the group behind his creation, Sonic Team. Though the game only received marginal success in its home country, almost overnight Sonic became a sensation in the West, solidifying Sega's place in Europe and turning the company into a household name in the United States.

For the first time, a company was able to directly compete with console and gamemaker Nintendo, which had dominated the second half of the 1980's. Though Nintendo still reigned supreme in Japan, the highly-contested 16-bit war in the West was a marvel to behold, the big two being neck and neck through almost the entirety of the third generation of console gaming.

The game propelled the creators into the realm of video game superstardom, programmer Yuji Naka for a time becoming the face of Sega much as Shigeru Miyamoto became the face of Nintendo after the success of Super Mario Bros. The franchise took off, with a version of the game being released on the Sega Master System and a series of sequels across Sega's various consoles over the years. It not only became the definitive title for the system and replaced Altered Beast as the pack-in title for the West, but would go on to be ported to no less than twenty platforms after its initial release.</desc>

    <desc>Sonic the Hedgehog - Westside Island is a palette and layout hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive. All levels have new layouts, new names and new palettes and the bosses have been made harder. In addition, the level select has been edited and you can now only start on Act 1 of each level from here. If you want to play Sonic 1 but with a new change of pace, this could be what you are looking for. 

Story

Sonic is peacefully relaxing in the summer sun when he get's word from Tails that Robotnik has found six of the seven emeralds and has returned to Westside Island to try to take over the world, once and for all! Sonic, being the impatient hedgehog that he is, rushes off and takes the Tornado 2 to Westside Island to investigate, leaving Tails alone at his workshop.

Levels

Neo Hills
Visit a tranquil hillside at dusk, with the sun setting on the lake of the Island. Robotnik has infected the Island with many animal-like robots, called badniks, that will try to stop you.

Neon Plaza
The city night life in it's daylight form. Neon lights litter the streets of this secluded city. Dodge the spikes that Robotnik has laid out to stop you.

Magma Zone
Westside Island's active volcano could blow at any minute and traversing it is the only way to get to Robotnik. Dodge lava pits and ride blocks underground to pass this searing ordeal.

Lylat Star
Take to the skies at night as you explore the metropolis of the stars. Robotnik has been this way and broken the starlit speedway and it's up to you to trak him down.

Coral Ruin
Explore the remains of a tropical labyrinth. Robotnik had been digging here for precious energy to fuel his desires. You must be close to his fortress now.

Tech Engine
This is it, Robotnik's Tech Engine! Powered by the six chaos emeralds he has found, Robotnik is about to take over the world. Do your best to stop the madman's plot and save Westside Island, and the World!

    <desc>Sonic: The Lost Land 2 is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis by Shadow Fire. The game is comprised of 11 levels, each filled with dangers you must overcome in order to stop the plans of the maniacal Dr. Eggman. Only palettes, some slight layout changes and various other small modifications have been made for the time being, since this hack is on hold for Sonic - The Lost Land. 

Story

The Lost Land. A beautiful island paradise, once inhabited by creatures known only as the ancients. After managing to overthrow the maniacal Eggman's previous plot, Sonic stumbles across a hidden part of the Lost Land. Unfortunately, Eggman found it first, and has already set up base to work on his next evil plot. With Shadow gone, having left the Lost Land after helping out beforehand, it's only up to the blue hedgehog to save the world from whatever Eggman is planning.

Characters

Sonic - The Lost Land 2 only allows for one playable character, with the evil Dr Eggman as the antagonist. Although by using savestates, you can add Tails to the game.

Sonic the Hedgehog

Sonic is a blue, 15-year-old hedgehog who lives on the planet Earth. He has the ability to run at supersonic speeds, hence his name. He is always running all over the world, rarely stopping for anything. He is carefree and relaxed; however, he is also very intolerant of injustice, and he will do anything he can to help those in need. He has also got a quick wit, short temper, and a fairly large ego.

Dr Ivo Robotnik (EGGMAN)

With an IQ of 300, and self-proclaimed the greatest scientific genius in the world, Eggman stops at nothing in his attempts at world conquest. While his plans are constantly foiled by Sonic, this only makes him more determined to conquer the world. Will he succeed?

    <desc>Sonic: The Lost Land is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive by Shadow Fire. The game is comprised of 7 levels, each filled with traps and badniks intent on bringing down Sonic once and for all. There is also a special realm consisting of 6 Chaos Emeralds. If you have collected at least 50 rings by the time you finish the level, you will see a giant ring. Jump into it to be taken to the secret realm. A dynamic palette system is set up , making each act load its own palette (a la Knuckles' Chaotix), as well as a dynamic music system, allowing each act to load its own music. 

Story

The Lost Land. A beautiful island paradise, once inhabited by creatures known only as the ancients. Unfortunately, it has recently come under threat by the mechanic menace known as EggRobo. Sonic knows that EggRobo must be stopped, and with the help of Shadow, who is contemplating his future, he sets off to put an end to the mech's plans.

Characters

Sonic - The Lost Land allows for two playable characters, with the evil Dr Eggman as the antagonist.

Sonic the Hedgehog

Sonic is a blue, 15-year-old hedgehog who lives on the planet Earth. He has the ability to run at supersonic speeds, hence his name. He is always running all over the world, rarely stopping for anything. He is carefree and relaxed; however, he is also very intolerant of injustice, and he will do anything he can to help those in need. He has also got a quick wit, short temper, and a fairly large ego.

Shadow the Hedgehog

Shadow is the ultimate life form experiment, a joint-creation of Professor Gerald Robotnik and Black Doom aboard the space colony ARK. His exact age isn't approximated, but he is assumed to be around 50 years old. Once hungry for revenge after the death of Maria, Gerald's granddaughter, he is now aware of his past, and who he "is." He prefers to be a loner, but he occasionally tags along with Sonic and his friends when Eggman is up to no good. He is black, with red stripes down his spines and arms. He uses his ability, Chaos Control, to harness the powers of the Chaos Emeralds to enhance his natural abilities. While he is unable to move very quickly on his own, he possesses fire-powered jet skates, which allow him to move much faster than he would be able to without them.

Please note: Shadow is not available in the current or previous releases of this hack.

EggRobo

Created by the evil genius scientist Dr. Eggman, the EggRobo was originally a decoy to trick Knuckles into trusting Eggman, who then attempted to steal and harness the power of the legendary Master Emerald. However, after malfunctioning, he intends to destroy all organic life on Earth, starting with Sonic the Hedgehog.

    <desc>Overview:

The ear-splitting cry of a Griffin wracks your brain and echoes down the long dark corridors of Sorcerer's Kingdom. Only your sense of duty to your King gives you the courage to venture forth. As you defeat foe after foe in this precarious land, you feel your muscles growing stronger and your reflexes getting swifter. Up ahead you finally glimpse the daylight and run for fear of what is closing in behind you. You find yourself at the edge of a towering cliff where your only hope for escape is to don your magical wings and fly...

Gameplay:

Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by the king, as a reward for completing quests.

The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or attack a monster that is within your current range, a turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle started.

Hints:

- Sound Test -
Right before the Sorcerers kingdom title page comes up imput this code in and hold them untill you get to a black screen with the soundeffects and music.

    <desc>I find it hard to say much about this game. I have only found it floating around the web as a ROM  and one buggy as hell at that! When flashed to a cartridge or when started up in Kega Fusion, the game kept freezing. I only got it to work using GenS, and even then it didn't run properly, constantly producing a number of very strange errors (opponent freezing in one place, characters turning into a mass of jumbled pixels, or hurting yourself by hitting any button!). Also, even if you're able to control the characters, these controls hardly work at all. In short, the Genesis Soul Edge  is totally unplayable!

Which is a real shame, because it looks very nice; the graphics are colorful, and the sprites are nicely drawn. Also, the ROM indicates that this would be a 32-bit game, which is pretty rare as far as pirates go. But the only version of the game I've found is buggy and incomplete, so unless someone can point out an actual working version of that game to me, I'll strongly advise against getting this game. It will only drive you mad!

    <desc>Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2 is a 1994 platform game developed and published by Konami for the Sega Mega Drive. It is a sequel to Rocket Knight Adventures. Even though the intro screen refers to it as Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, it was only referred to as Sparkster on the US and EU packaging. A game known only as Sparkster was also released on the Super Nintendo but is a different game starring the same Sparkster character. Later a sequel just called Rocket Knight was released for the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.

The game stars an opossum named Sparkster who carries a sword and jetpack on a mission to stop King Gedol from taking over the Kingdom of Zephyrus and kidnapping Princess Cherry.</desc>

    <desc>Hola! Sylvester's alter-ego, Dr Cheesefinger, has captured Speedy's girlfriend Carmel and took the whole cheese supply with him. With the help of some other Looney Tunes characters, you can fight back through a large number of platform levels.

Speedy can throw his hat or jump enemies to defeat them. To get an ally, you need to collect certain objects (e.g. carrots for Bugs Bunny) and in the meantime, you also have to free your captured friends. Ay, carumba!

    <desc>Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage, or simply Maximum Carnage is a beat-'em-up game based on the Spider-Man universe. It was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1994.

This is one of the rarest Mega Drive games in Japan along with Acclaim's WWF Raw. Rather than roll out a line of exclusive Japanese packaging, Acclaim opted for giving the Japanese European packaging with very minor changes. As a result, this is the only game in the Mega Drive's official library to have the same product code across all regions (internally the game's code is T-81256-50 in Europe/Japan but the packaging says otherwise).</desc>

    <desc>Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, commonly referred to as just Spider-Man and also referred in the Mega-CD as The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, is a platform video game based on the Spider-Man Marvel comic book series. In the game you control Spider-Man, who must defeat various enemies and famous villains in an attempt to stop a bomb and save New York. Mary Jane is also kidnapped by Venom.

The game was initially released on the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System in 1991, being the first the one that got more recognition. This version was later updated for the Mega CD release, with refined levels, graphics and a CD audio soundtrack. The game was very successful, so much so that some sources claim that two thirds of Mega Drive owners owned this game in some form or another. In Australia, the game was eventually bundled with The Incredible Hulk.</desc>

    <desc>Spiritual Warfare is a Zelda-like clone where you play as a soldier of God, fighting the forces of darkness in various parts of a modern city to find the armor of God, each one guarded by increasingly difficult demon bosses. When you are dire need, an angel may come down and help you, if you answer Bible questions correctly. The game will take through increasingly difficult levels of play, where in the end you will face off with Satan himself.

    <desc>Excerpted from The Journal of Paranormal Phenomena, August 1989

"In the thick Jungles of Cancun I discovered the site of an ancient Mayan temple. Most unusual was the discovery of a mask quite unlike anything that has been found before.

Carved from a bone like material it seems to be a representation of a deity. This mask was attached to the wearer's head with interesting straps that were fashioned to look like skeletal hands. Ruins found in the area refer to this relic as the 'terror head' or perhaps a better translation would be the terror mask. This is a breakthrough discovery."

Excerpted from a letter of Dr. Mueller to a friend:

Dear Klaus,

"This mask is incredible. You mentioned reading my piece in JOPP. However, I couldn't mention in the article the aura of power surrounding this thing. You pick it up and shiver. A primal wave rushes up your spine. When you visit we'll have to go over it. The lake is lovely this fall and the fish are biting. See you."

You've come to dread the night. In the clutches of sleep the nightmares begin. Always the same, Jennifer screaming in the dark until suddenly she stops. Silence, then the infernal whisperings of the mask begin again.

"Rick, we can save her.... you know we can... remember the power... remember how much you liked it? The house, Rick.... Jennifer's waiting.... and I'm waiting for you."

Awake in a sweat with your heart racing you can almost remember the last time. Locked into the mask, body surging with feral rage and an insatiable hunger. The cold steel pipe in your hands slick with gore. Under the mask you were smiling. You know you have to go, to save Jennifer....or so you say.

--From the Genesis Splatterhouse 2 instruction manual.

Directions:

Pick up sticks. And pipes and bones and chainsaws and shotguns and potassium bombs. Where the in the world are we at? An Al Qaeda birthday party for Osama bin Laden? Whatever. Just grab anything that looks like a weapon and use it.

How do they expect zombies to get a nourishing meal, when there is nothing for us, the psycho-killers in the K-Mart masks and their main food supply, to find except weapons? Not a single real Goodie, like a candybar, to be found.

Nothing. Couldn't the crummy designers have at least put in a candybar?

OK, you got Zombies, Screaming Mimis and Ghouls to kill or avoid. Not a great selection. Although when they jump you, you better either get away quick or kill them if you can, cause they can be quite deadly. Avoidance pays off.

And what's that? NO POINTS! Oh, this game really stinks! If I am going to invest three weeks of my life defeating this game I expect to at least have some points next to my initials at the end. Otherwise what was it all for? The last game I played, I spent so much time winning it that my wife divorced me. I lost my job, my house and my kids, but at least I got some points next to my initials.

You can use Option to change the button configuration, so for the following instead of naming the button, I am using ATTACK and JUMP.

Special Moves: 
Low Kick      Press DOWN then ATTACK
Jump Kick     Press JUMP and while in the air Press ATTACK
Slide Kick    Hold D-Control Diagonally in desired direction and Press JUMP
              Then when Rick hits the ground:
              Press ATTACK and Hold D-Control Diagonally in desired direction
     
OK, everybody who thinks they can actually perform a Slide Kick raise their hand. Liar!
               
Oh yeah, don't forget Jennifer. 

Controls:  

A Button: Jump
B Button: Attack
C Button: Jump
DOWN: Crouch
DOWN: Picks Up Weapon
DOWN + B: Low Kick
Start Button: Start / Pause

Hints:

- Level Passwords -
Enter the following code at the Password screen....
Level 2: EDK - NAI - ZOL - LDL
Level 3: IDO - GEM - IAL - LDL
Level 4: ADE - XOE - ZOL - OME
Level 5: EFH - WEI - RAG - ORD
Level 6: ADE - NAI - WRA - LKA
Level 7: EFH - XOE - IAL - LDL
level 8: EDK - VEI - IAL - LDL
Then you should go to your desired level.

    <desc>Spot Goes to Hollywood is an isometric sequel to Cool Spot. It was developed by Eurocom and published by Virgin Interactive in 1995 for the Sega Mega Drive, with significantly enhanced versions with different levels appearing on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in 1996. These versions were developed by Burst. A SNES version of the game was planned, but cancelled. A Sega 32X port was also seemingly in development, only MANIAC Magazine mentions it, giving it a 75.

In the game, the 7-up mascot Spot has become trapped within a movie projector, and must now travel between different movie genres attempting to escape.</desc>

    <desc>Apparently this is a hack of the Chinese original Super Mario Bros for Mega Drive which was a bloody awful game.  What I can tell you though is that Squirrel King is actually pretty good.  Graphics throughout the game are of a high standard, especially for a Chinese original game.  Sound is also pretty decent.  This game really holds it's own in the playability department.  Everything is just so smooth as if it was an officially produced game.  Animation on the enemies can be a bit dodgy at times or even no existent but that won't throw you off the enjoyment.

The idea of the game is pretty simple, just get from start to finish avoiding the enemies and stuff they throw at you.  Throughout the levels you'll also find items that you can pick up to throw at the enemy as well as finding hidden power ups or life icons.  The levels are challenging enough to keep you coming back for more and don't seem to suffer from any unreachable areas that many games of this type do.  Boss battle I found though a a little tedious but that's just me.  All in all, Squirrel King is a very good Chinese unlicensed game.

    <desc>You play Kevin Codner, our aquatic hero. You hear that the SS Lucifer has suffered some sort of mishap (the exact nature of the incident is not made clear in the game. Somehow the captain is shown pulling the plug from his bath, and a fountain of water shoots up and starts flooding the ship.). Kevin gets into a yellow submarine and begin saving the passengers.

Gameplay:

Each level has a certain number of passengers on it, and a certain quota to save to pass. Kevin must guide the passengers to their level exit, and then make his way to his own exit. There may be obstacles in the way, and there may also be water pouring into the ship's compartment, forcing the player to play quickly.

Kevin has explosives at his disposal, allowing him to blast open doors or blast apart cargo crates that are blocking the way. There may be gaps that the passengers need to cross to reach their exit. These may be covered by pulling a simple lever and activating the bridge, but other times Kevin will have to build a bridge from cargo crates.

There are conveyor belts and magnetic hoists to help in this task - but the conveyor belts may prevent the passengers from reaching their destination also. Kevin will have to find the correct levers to switch the direction of the belts.

The passengers are very stupid - they will walk into fires or off platforms and get themselves killed. Kevin can use his life-boat to give them a little time in the water - but it will not last forever, and if they have not reached a ladder by the time it deflates, they are back where they started - in the freezing water. If they stay there too long, they will die. There are a few jetpacks that passengers can use for instant escape, but never enough.

The player must patch up burst pipes spraying scalding steam, prevent passengers from falling into pools of acid, and cover up fires with cargo crates.

    <desc>Star Control is a science-fiction wargame which pits the forces of the Alliance of Free Stars against those of the predatory Ur-Quan Hierarchy. The games are designed so that you can ease into play, familiarizing yourself with menus, options and player controls. The Alliance and Hierarchy each possess different types of warships. Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate.

Gameplay:

The game featured the basic Spacewar!-style combat engine, M?l?e (as it was called due to the close combat involved, even though the ships actually fired projectile weapons at each other and engage one by one) as well as a strategic game engine with a three-dimensional cluster of stars as the terrain. There was no real story component to the game, aside from a cursory background story explaining the existence of two alliances of alien races at war, the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls. However, the main attraction to this game was the well thought-out spacecraft design, resulting in a highly effective balance between the two sides. It could be played by one or two players as the complete game, or purely as either melee or strategy. Single player mode pitted the player against the computer AI, that featured a selectable ferocity.

As in the later games, the various races' ships have widely differing appearances and abilities. The ships' sizes, maneuverability, and speed vary; in addition, each ship has a distinct primary weapon and a secondary ability. For instance, the Ur-Quan Dreadnought has a powerful main gun and the ability to launch independent fighters; while the Mmrnmhrm Transformer has the ability to change between two forms, a slow but quickly-turning one with a short-range laser as its main weapon, and the other quick but slowly-turning with long-range guided missiles. Despite the mishmash of unique ships the designers were able to create a finely-tuned balance.

Hints:

- Add Precursor relics to any Full Game scenario -
In the Full Game module, select a scenario to play, choose visible or hidden stars, then tap the B button to read through the scenario description. As the ''ENTERING NEW STAR CLUSTER'' screen appears, immediately press and hold the left arrow on the controller's directional pad (''D-pad''). Continue to hold the D-pad in the left direction until the star cluster appears, then release it.
There will now be Precursor relics at most of the unexplored stars in the cluster.

    <desc>"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Crossroads of Time" is a 2D action adventure based on the famous TV series.

You play Benjamin Sisko, commander of Federation space station Deep Space Nine. When the station is attacked by Bajoran terrorists, your mission to uncover their plot leads you from DS9 to Bajor, beyond the wormhole and even through time itself.

Moving through the side-scrolling environments of DS9 and other places, Sisko must complete several missions like disarming bombs or rescuing hostages. If necessary, Sisko can use a phaser to stun enemies. To solve puzzles, he can use a tricorder and other items. The plot is often carried forward by interacting with other characters from the TV series.

    <desc>The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.

Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.

From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication: Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).

Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.

Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.

While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.

Trivia:

Though information on a Borg cube is present in the ship's database, and a sprite set for the vessel is resident in the game's memory, it does not appear in-game at all.

The game misspells Senatorious several times, providing a confusing list of spellings for the race.

This is one of the few Star Trek games in which Klingons do not make an appearance.

This game was released for both the SNES and Sega Genesis; though the plot and most gameplay elements were maintained, there are many significant differences that cause gameplay discrepancies. The Genesis version has diplomatic sequences wherein the player reasons with various entities (ranging from Romulan commanders to miners on a desolate moon), and the results have profound outcomes on the course of play. The SNES lacks this feature entirely, and the sequence at the end of the game where Jean-Luc Picard speaks with the IFD's interface-analogue is eschewed, and replaced with what amounts to a single "congratulations" screen, with no resolution to the story. Also, the SNES version makes mandatory a mission that is secret in the Genesis version (it is very difficult to unlock and requires a lengthy diplomatic exchange with a Chodak captain; the mission is exceptionally difficult, and is made more harrowing by the fact that only one attempt at the mission is allowed and failure means the opportunity to complete the mission is lost forever, but it is not part of the Genesis storyline and the game can be completed in its entirety without the player even knowing about this mission). It is a mark of pride to be able to complete this mission at all, and due to its uncalled-for level of difficulty, it nearly renders the SNES version unplayable. Other differences include the order in which events occur, changes to level maps, a limited amount of phaser energy and an unbreathable atmosphere in the Oriens Gamma IIIB mines in the SNES version (which further augmented its already obscene difficulty, the latter forcing the player to begin each of its sections, which were thickly-laden with monsters, using Lieutenant Commander Data, who, being an android, is not required to respirate, to restore air circulation for other crew members), and the absence of Dr. Beverly Crusher's medkit in the Genesis version, which allowed the player to heal other members of the awayteam during the course of away missions.

The spud-like monsters resident in the Oriens Gamma IIIB mines do not attack Deanna Troi. Ostensibly this is because she is an empath.

The game sports a number of ensigns and lesser crewmen who do not appear in the televised series and in fact were created specifically for this game. Each of these crewmen is actually one of the game's designers, dressed in Starfleet uniforms, their visage pixelized and incorporated into the game as portraits seen when selecting crewmen for awayteams. Incidentally, there are two mutually-exclusive sets of non-canon crewmen for each game, and the SNES version includes Ed Semrad, who was then an editor for Electronic Gaming Monthly. His reason for appearing in the game is not known.

THE STORM BREWS:

Prepare to enter worlds of terror, where daylight battles the darkened night. As thunder roars its ravenous call throughout the land, streaks of lightening crackle through the dimly lit sky.

You, StormLord, have been summoned to the valley of the Enchanted Realm to rescue the entombed princesses captured by the Evil Rotting Crone.

As StormLord, you embark upon your most perilous journey. Only you possess the power and fury necessary to vanquish all who dare oppose you. Prepare to charge into battle with the Dreaded Draconian Fire Dogs. Thrust your mighty sword at Barbaric Killer Bees. Keep an eye out for Pearsbteh, the mutated man-munching moss, for they are hungrily eyeing you.

Rescue the entombed princesses hidden throughout the desolate world. Locate the treasures hidden within the labyrinth so the legend of StormLord will be told for centuries.

--From the Genesis Storm Lord instruction manual.

Trivia:

- Censorship -
An urban legend surrounds the Sega Genesis edition of the game. According to the legend, Sega of America pulled the game off the market and forced Ravorsoft to give clothing to cover up the faries breasts. Indeed, certain advertisements for the game often made note of the controversy.

Yet, programmer Kevin Seghetti stated that the changes on the Genesis version were done voluntarily.

However, When Amstrad Action gave the complete CPC version of the game away on their free covertape they edited the code of the game to cover up the fairies with a black square. This was due to avoid controversy with their young readership, or their parents.

Hints:

- More Lives -
Enter the following code at the Pause screen....
A - A - A - A - C - C - B - B - B - C - A
Then you should have gotten 9 more lives

- More Time -
Enter the following code at the Pause screen....
B - A - A - A - C - Up - Up - Up - A - A - A
Then you should have more time to complete the level

- Skip Current Level -
Enter the following code at the Pause screen....
C - B - B - B - A - A - A - A - C - C - A - A - A - A
Then you should skip to the next level

    <desc>Street Fighter II': Champion Edition, called Street Fighter II Dash in Japan, is an upgrade to Capcom's Street Fighter II released in arcades. Capcom ported it to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition in the US and Europe and Street Fighter II Dash Plus  in Japan.

Many consoles and computers have received Street Fighter II in one form or another, but during the early 1990s it seemed that Nintendo were at a slight advantage in the console wars thanks to Capcom's release of the original Street Fighter II on the SNES. With the upgrade, Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting also being a Nintendo exclusive, many Sega fans grew worried that they would not be able to play a version of the revolutionary fighter on the Sega Mega Drive, however, Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition calmed fears, giving users all twelve Street Fighter II characters available to play from the start and including the hyper modes seen in Hyper Fighting.

There were many revisions of Street Fighter II in the arcades, and each time a revision was released Capcom insisted in bringing the new version to home consoles. This meant Super Street Fighter II also saw a release on the Sega Mega Drive which although adds four new characters and stages, is still very similar to this release.

The Mega Drive version of the game has since been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

    <desc>Street Racer is a racing game, similar to Super Mario Kart, released for the Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive in 1994, the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Game Boy in 1996, and also the Amiga, Amiga CD32, and PC. It was made by UbiSoft and Vivid Image, and features nine cartoon characters which you could race with, one of which being a secret character unlockable by completing the game. It was one of the first games to feature multi-tap compatibility, and was the first racing game to allow 8 players to race simultaneously.

Despite the similar logo style Street Racer has no connection to the Street Fighter series by Capcom, nor to the game Street Racing Syndicate by Namco.

Gameplay:

The game features the ability to race the Street Racer Championship, beginning with the Bronze Championship and moving on to the Silver Championship, Gold Championship and Platinum Championship. Each championship gave you, after winning, a new password which could be entered on the Options Screen in order to unlock new tracks. The winner of the championship would be the driver with the most points after every race has been completed. Points are awarded according to the final positioning of each race, with bonus points awarded to the driver with the most punches, the most stars collected, the fastest lap, a record lap and drivers who lapped other drivers. The Championship could be raced in Championship, Head-to-head or Practice mode.

The game also featured the ability to choose the tracks for a Custom Championship, to drive a head-to-head series with a CPU driver, and to drive individual practice races. There was also a racing game called "Rumble", the objective being to knock the drivers out of a ring. It could be played in 3 levels of difficulty. Also, a "Soccer" mode (not in the Playstation version) featured a field to play against all other characters, with a giant soccer ball and a single goal for all. The score wasn't of team play though.

For all modes of play, whether Championship, Custom Championship, Rumble, or Soccer, Street Racer allowed the setting of many of the game parameters.

- Characters -

There were 8 characters who could be raced with in Street Racer. These were:

    - Hodja Nasreddin - A 400 plus year old Turkish magician, described as 'friendly' and 'wise'

    - Frank Instein - A 100 year old, big, green, Frankenstein lookalike

    - Suzulu - A middle-aged African Voodoo specialist

    - Biff - A 19 year old typical 'school bully' figure from America

    - Raphael - A young, 'cool' pimp figure from Italy who 'secretly admired' Surf

    - Surf Sister - A young Australian girl with a 'degree in mechanics'

    - Helmut von Pointenegger - A retired German pilot and veteran of the First World War

    - Sumo-San - A Japanese sumo wrestler from the future

    - Comeeo- A fat pimp from Austin who wants to pimp out the other racers.

Each character has four special moves. They have a defensive move, an attacking move and left and right punches, which vary for each character. These moves are unlimited and do not require pick ups making it unique from most racing games.

After winning the Platinum Championship a ninth character, Rabbit, also becomes available. Rabbit's abilities are similar to Raphael's, but slightly better all around. After Rabbit is unlocked one driver is randomly left out of each championship or race so that there are only eight drivers racing on the track.

- Tracks -

At first there are only eight tracks available on Street Racer. There is one track for each driver, named after the driver with the number one after (for example, Frank 1). After winning the Silver Championship a second track for each driver becomes available, and after winning the Gold Championship a third becomes available. When Rabbit is unlocked after winning the Platinum Championship three more tracks themed around Wonderland also become available.

Each set of tracks is themed around the track they are named after, with in-race music to suit. For example, Hodja's tracks have a magical theme and music, whilst Sumo-San has upbeat, futuristic, oriental music with a very Middle Eastern style of race track.

Hints:

- Edit Stats -
On the character select screen, press: A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B. Now select a character, hold A and use the control pad to edit your driver's stats.

- Gold Cup -
Access to the Options Screen and then scroll down to highlight the Cup Password Option. Enter the password BEFQMR to unlock the Gold Cup.

- Mega Password -
Access to the Options Screen and then scroll down to highlight the Cup Password Option. Enter the mega password HJACUY to unlock all Cups.

- Silver Cup -
Access to the Options Screen and then scroll down to highlight the Cup Password Option. Enter the password JXPSVW to unlock the Silver Cup.

    <desc>An arcade beat 'em up, Street Smart puts you in the shoes of the ass-kicking "Karate Man" who decides to deliver a can of whup-ass to the reigning gang bangers in town.

Gameplay:

The gameplay resembles other fighting games like Double Dragon where the player can move in all eight directions in an arena fight and the player can kick, punch or do special moves. The player can choose to fight as "Karate-Man", a martial arts expert with lightning quick moves, or "Wrestler" (sometimes known as "Crusher"[citation needed]) with a powerful punch. Unlike most side-scrolling fighters, the players fight in an enclosed arena space,If two players are present, they can take on the enemy together but will always have a "Grudge Match" in the next round to determine who gets a bonus life/points. The two players can play through the entire game together.

- Opponents -

    - "Slippery" Sam Santana (Age: 38; Weight: 205 lbs.)

    - "Tiptoes" Tommy (Age: 45; Weight: 310 lbs.)

    - Jake "The Wrench" (Age: 40; Weight: 185 lbs.)

    - Larry "Legbreaker" Lubinski (Age: 19; Weight: 220 lbs.)

    - Antonio "Crybaby" Palermo (Age: 25; Weight: 265 lbs.)

    - Mike "The Muscle" McDermit (Age: 30; Weight: 290 lbs.)

    - Bobby Brown (Age: 21; Weight: 175 lbs.)

    <desc>Streets of Rage 3 was the third SOR title, a 24-meg cart released by SEGA in 1994 exclusively on its most popular console, the Mega Drive. It featured a whole host of gameplay upgrades and innovative ideas that arguably made it the best title in the series (technically speaking, at least): the ability to run and dodge made for much faster gameplay, and a whole new set of moves with support for the 6-button SEGA controller. There was now a more complex plot and multiple ending scenarios.  

The game featured a new playable character who was central to the storyline: Dr. Zan, and also unlockable characters Shiva (Mr. X's right hand man) and Roo (a boxing kangaroo), alongside Skate and series regulars Axel and Blaze. Adam and Max are only seen in the game's cutscenes/endings.

In Bare Knuckle III, the Asian-region version of the game, Mr. X's Syndicate detonates a nuclear bomb in Wood Oak City, killing thousands of people. They then kidnap General Petrov, the highest ranking member of the US Military so that they can send an imposter to take his place and stir up a nuclear war between the United States and the country of Lima. Mr. X is now a brain in a jar, having lost his body in the events of Streets of Rage 2. 

This storyline (and intro cutscene) was censored in Streets of Rage 3 (A more detailed look at these differences can be found in our dedicated Bare Knuckle III section) - General Petrov was replaced by the Chief of Police, and the Syndicate was instead trying to replace key city officials with robot doubles, so that X could rule the city by remote control. 

As one of the four playable characters, you must battle your way through 6 levels of hot SOR action to rescue General Petrov/Police Chief O'Hara. If you don't reach him in time, you have to go to the White House/City Hall and stop Shiva from stirring up trouble. If you do manage to rescue him, however, you go to the Syndicate Stronghold where the X Robots are being produced, and after a confrontation with Dr. Dahm, you must face Mr. X himself, who battles with a robot body called 'Robot Y'. 

Streets of Rage 3's soundtrack is more abrasive and experimental than the classic club tunes of the previous titles, and as a result it was less popular with most players, though it does have its fans.

Introduces: ZAN, SHIVA, ROO (playable), ASH (Bare Knuckle III Only)

    <desc>Streets of Rage 3, called Bare Knuckle III in Japan, is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released by Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It is the last part of the Streets of Rage series and a sequel to Streets of Rage 2.

The game features several enhancements over Streets of Rage 2 such as a more complex plot, multiple endings, longer levels, more in-depth scenarios (with interactive levels and the return of traps like pits) and faster gameplay (with dash and dodge moves). Weapons can now only be used for a few times before breaking and can now be integrated with unique moves with certain characters, hidden characters have been added along with several cutscenes to give the story greater depth. Controls are identical to its predecessors.

Compared to its prequels, Streets of Rage 3 is a less common and more expensive game to find second-hand in its original Mega Drive form. It has, however, been released for the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, and for the Wii's Virtual Console service. The game also appeared in Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Streets of Rage 3 was not as successful as its predecessors for several reasons, most prominently the soundtrack. Though still composed by Yuzo Koshiro like the previous installments, Koshiro took a more experimental approach with the music inspired by Detroit's hard techno scene which was popular in Japanese night clubs at the time. It is said to have fared poorly when transitioned to the Mega Drive's sound chip. These problems are exacerbated on a PAL console, due to the unoptimised drop from a 60Hz refresh rate to 50Hz, effectively ruining large parts of the game.
Prototype screenshots show that a motorcycle stage was planned, with some code still present in the final ROM. It is unknown why this feature was axed.</desc>

    <desc>Streets of Rage, called Bare Knuckle: Ikari no Tetsuken in Japan, is a beat 'em up video game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. Its success meant that versions for the Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System were produced, with the latter being a European exclusive. It was the first in the Streets of Rage series and is a popular choice for compilations and Mega Drive re-releases for modern video game platforms.

Streets of Rage was primarily Sega's answer to Capcom's Final Fight, a very successful arcade game which Capcom had chosen to port to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Perhaps worried that this would divert attention away from the Mega Drive, Streets of Rage was created as a Sega exclusive, developed internally by Sega AM7. At the time of release, beat-'em-up games were very popular and Sega's title was no exception.

The music for Streets of Rage was composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who had previously offered his talents for Revenge of Shinobi. Koshiro's soundtrack would be widely praised, and he would be carried through into the development process of two sequels, Streets of Rage 2 and Streets of Rage 3, respectively.</desc>

    <desc>You're Strider, a crunching hulk of muscle with a grappling hook and laser sword. You're in a future land of backward time, and its evil Master is taunting you with defeat.

Can you survive 8 megs of incredible danger? Hang-glide into the citadel, then clang your hook into metal to stiff-arm up to safety. Stay alive by slashing armies, winged robots, and prehistoric monsters into shuddering heaps! Battle alluring Amazons who sling vicious boomerangs and drum out a war chant to turn your mind manic.

Slide, duck, and cartwheel past lasers, spikes and bombs. Screech to a halt in the face of giant metal monkeys and centipedes. Feel your biceps burst as you grapple with snarling musclemen. Cling to battleship bulkheads. Leap from Tyrannosaurus Rex. It's Strider! The Master awaits!

Hints:

- Get 3 Continues -
During the opening screen press,
A, C, B, C, A, Start

- Infinite Continues -
In order to get infinite continues, first put in the Genesis game "Altered Beast." As soon as the title screen comes up, pull the game out of the system (without turning it off). Then, put in "Strider" and reset the system. To check to see if the trick worked, go into the option mode. If you cannot move with the directional buttons (meaning if no option is highlighted yellow in the option mode), then the trick worked. Play through the game, and you can use as many continues as you need to beat the game.

    <desc>The first game in the long-running soccer series, which stood out from the crowd with a unique forced perspective 3D view rather than a simple overhead one. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.

    <desc>Super Battleship is a World War II themed video game released for the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo.

Gameplay:

The game had two modes: Super Battleship mode and Classic Battleship mode. Classic Battleship mode is essentially an electronic version of the board game Battleship. Super Battleship is a naval simulator played by sailing ships to a close enough range to shoot one's opponent's ships. Ships have four different weapons: missiles, torpedoes, depth charges, and guns.

    <desc>An unlicensed pirate port of Rage's legendary platform games for the Super Nintento. These games were released towards the end of the 16bit era, just as the 32bit consoles were being launched, and were supposed to show that there was still life left in Nintendo's aging 16bit platform. To a greater or lesser degree they succeeded wowing everyone with their superb graphics and great level design they became huge hits and helped Nintendo keep the SNES alive a little longer whilst they continued to develop the N64.

Seems to steal graphics from all three games in the series, the level graphics for instance look like they are mainly taken from the third game whilst the main character is stolen straight out of the first game and the baddies seem to be taken from all three games. Unfortunately it's lost something in the translation, the graphics don't seem quite as sharp as the originals and the cleverly designed levels and gameplay elements are also absent. The main thing that's missing is the 'tag team' style gameplay where you need to use the right character to reach certain parts of the levels, here you just get to control Donkey Kong himself. The game relies far too heavily on split second timing and pixel perfect leaps and you'll quickly grow frustrated with the poor level design. If you want to play the Donkey Kong Country games then I strongly suggest that you seek out the SNES originals instead.

Unlike previous outings, Super Fantasy Zone was handled entirely by Sunsoft (under license from Sega), who had previously brought Fantasy Zone and Fantasy Zone II to the Nintendo Famicom.

For unknown reasons the game was not released in cartridge form in North America, but is currently unconfirmed as being a Sega Channel title. It eventually saw a more widespread release as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

It was released in the full deluxe simulated-motorcycle cabinet later as Limited Edition Hang-On in 1991, but technically it was built on the arcade hardware that powered Space Harrier.

Ports were released for the Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, Sega Mega Drive and ZX Spectrum. Super Hang-On was also released for the Sharp X68000 computer in Japan. The game also appeared on several Mega Drive compilations, namely Mega Games I (bundled with the console as Mega Drive Magnum Set), and 6-Pak.</desc>

    <desc>This isn't just football; it's SUPER HIGH IMPACT! It'a all the fast-paced action of the bone-crunching arcade smash! Quick-Action play selections get you into the action before you can say "WICKED HIT!" Choose from 18 hard-charging teams and over 30 plays, from a red-dog blitz to a never-say-die superfly! "YER TOAST" if the HIT-O-METER rates your tackle "DWEEB", but you can settle the score the ol' fashioned way with an all-out team brawl. When you're tired of watching football from the sidelines... get into the button-pounding arcade action of SUPER HIGH IMPACT!

Hints:

- Extra Time Out -
After running out of regular time outs, pause the game and press A to call a extra time. 

- Easily block kicks -
When the computer is going for a field goal or extra point, take control of one of the defensive players all the way in the back of the field goal block formation. When the ball is snapped, run at the long snapper, then turbo at the kicker and jump. The glitch comes in the form is the long snapper never bothering to try blocking you, and you'll be able to block virtually any kick with ease.

- Easy defense -
When on defense, pick the Suicide defense and take control of either one of the two nose guards. Hold down the Turbo button and direction yourself at the quarterback before the ball is even snapped. On virtually every single play, you'll blast through the line and nail the quarterback before he can even move regardless of whether or not the play is a run or pass, simply because the offensive line never bothers to block you when this trick is performed.

    <desc>Super Kick Off is an enhanced developed version of the popular football game developed by Dino Dini for consoles. It includes 40 teams (16 national and 24 club), along the ability to edit club team names and shirts and player names and looks. Game modes include friendlies, Domestic League and Cup (composed by eight English teams), European League (16 European teams) and International cup (eight team tournament). Training allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition. Players can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.

Gameplay:

About the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view with the ball not sticking to the players' feet being the most prominent gameplay feature.

    <desc>Here, the naming situation seems to be a bit confusing at first. As far as I can tell, the first Mario game that was unofficially programmed was the Genesis Super Mario World, the strange hack of an unfinished Chip 'n Dale prototype (on the pirate market released under the name of Squirrel King, by the way). So, this here is the second Mario game for the Genesis, even though it's a port of the original Super Mario Bros.

The programmers who dealt with this port didn't quite have the troubles the porters of Aladdin II went through in order to match the game to cartridge size: They simply took the Super Nintendo game Super Mario All-Stars, which included Super Mario Bros. 1-3 and the former Japanese-only Lost Levels, and only left the very first game in! That way, they could leave the entire game intact rather effortlessly. Well, more or less, at least. 

This port is more or less the polar opposite of Aladdin II, quality-wise. Sounds and Graphics have hardly suffered, so you get the original Mario themes to each stage, and the level layout hasn't been touched at all. Unfortunately, the controls and game mechanics are an entirely different matter.

The control scheme has been changed to fit the three-button layout of the Genesis pad. Ignoring the old mantra "If it ain't broke, don't attempt to fix it," they decided to switch some of the controls around. So now, C makes you jump, B is the Dash, and A is - if you've picked the flower - the fireball. They hadn't changed the old two-button layout for the SNES-version, and for good reason: The old two-button scheme was simple and worked just fine. An additional button makes it a bit harder if you want to fire in the midst of a sprint-jump, for example.

Furthermore, Mario is hardly controllable at all whenever you're dashing or jumping. Mario Bros. always hard floaty physics, but you could usually pinpoint a jump quite well. Here, trying to control Mario feels more like trying to steer a cow over thin ice  sliding uncontrollably, hardly able to change direction, and once it starts moving, you never now when it'll stop, though it usually ends up being into an opponent or at the bottom of a pit. Also, the porters followed the "jump on an opponent" formula of dispatching enemies a bit too closely: You can even kill foes who originally were immune to these kind of attacks, like the venus Fly Traps or the spikes!

And finally, there are the glitches! Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of them, and they range from smaller graphical issues (The green Luigi sprite turning into a red Mario when having the flower-power up and getting hit) to annoying (fireballs or Bowser turning into a mess of jumbled pixels) to downright irritating (gravity and jumping occasionally spinning out of control whenever floating platforms are involved for example, which leads to many accidental deaths).

While it is a nice oddity to have, gameplay-wise the quality of this port is pretty shoddy. The bad controls make the game way harder than it was before, and the glitches and bugs make the whole game more irritating than enjoyable. Still, when you see this cartridge, I would pick it up, if only for the curiosity-factor! 

FUN FACT: There is a Sonic pirate out there (My cart reads Sonic 6, but I've also seen it floating around under the label of Sonic Jam) that is actually a sprite hack of this game! The Mario sprite has been replaced by a red Sonic that turns blue when picking up a mushroom, though all other power ups have also remained in their original Mario Bros. state! Even more oddly, the controls of Sonic seem a bit more tighter than in Mario Bros. 2, making playing that game a tad more enjoyable!

Super Monaco GP is a 1989 arcade racing game by Sega. It is the sequel to Monaco GP, but rather than being a top-down racer it has a first person view.

The player drives a formula one car around a track inspired by the Monaco Grand Prix, and many of the car drivers and manufacturers are based on formula one drivers who were active in the late 1980s. The exception is the "Sega SG1000 V8" engine, which is named after the Sega SG-1000 video game console.

Sega was sued by Philip Morris due to the unauthorised Marlboro cigarette advertisements in the game. This was also criticised as an attempt to market cigarettes to children, as many arcade users at the time were under age. Other in-game advertisements advertise Sega's earlier arcade game Flicky.

Super Monaco CP was ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Sega Game Gear (where it was one of three launch titles for the system in Japan, along with Columns and Pengo), Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive and ZX Spectrum. The Mega Drive version was highly received and offered an extra "World Championship Mode", featuring tracks from the 1989 Formula One season. This version of the game has since been included in numerous compilations.

Super Monaco GP was followed by Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II which built upon the previous game.</desc>

    <desc>Enter the world of off-road racing as 4 vehicles will face each other, on a series of tracks which are based around flipped and reversed versions of a core selection. Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version) in this conversion of a classic arcade game.

Gameplay:

In the game, up to 3 players (4 in the NES version through use of either the NES Satellite or NES Four Score) compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. Good results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro boosters. The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to 0. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' Sprint series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in most arcade-style racing games today.

Hints:

- Super Off Road Slower Opponents -
To slow down your opponents, use the same initials as the computer driver.

    <desc>A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga.

A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering.

24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.

The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.

Hints:

- Passwords -
Enter these passwords to obtain what follows:
SPRINTER: gives you access to the Pro League and Nitro speed setting.
GUARDIAN: gives you access to the Acid Grand Prix and allows to select Forula 1 cars in single races.
CHOCMILK: gives you access to the Bovine Warrior league and allows to select the wheeled cows in single races.
SPACEMAN: turns on a low gravity mode racing.

    <desc>Smash TV is an arcade hit by Williams Electronics, first released in 1990.

The game was brought to a variety of platforms by Acclaim, including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, NES, Sega Game Gear, Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, SNES, and ZX Spectrum. It has recently been re-released on the Xbox Live Arcade service. The game was followed by a semi-sequel Total Carnage, which did not prove to be as successful.

The Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo ports were called Super Smash TV, though are essentially the same game and the title screens were left unchanged.

Johnny Cage from the Mortal Kombat series is said to have completed the Smash TV course.</desc>

    <desc>Weatherded and damaged, Thunder Blade returned victorious from its last mission against the renegade troops. But, this was not to be its last flight.

Reorganized with mega amounts of devastating militar electronics and weapons, the renegade troops have once again focused their sights on dominating the free world. From a secret power base in the East, they unleash their deadly troops who will take to land, sea, and air power- fully armed.

But so are you. From the cockpit of this remodified bird, you've got a state-of-the-art defense system at your fingertips. An aerodynamically designed alloy body flies up to 523 kph while a 20 mm Gatling Gun fires up to 4,800 shots a minute. A computer-aided flight system takes you through even the most hostile environments. Don't worry, you're firing cannons and dropping air-to-surface AATM missiles from your skids, so there's no stopping you and the greatest chopper in the sky.

Your objective is to blow the central enemy base sky high. But getting there is easier said than done. There are four stages to this game where you'll encounter cities, deserts, caves, oceans, and refineries. The strategy is easy, shoot straight, be brave, and just maybe you'll get your wings out of this mission. The free world as we know it, depends on you.

--From the Genesis Super Thunder Blade instruction manual.

Gameplay:

As in its predecessor, the player takes control of an helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas. The helicopter itself uses guns and missiles, and can also air brake. A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to Space Harrier, but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. Super Thunder Blade had four stages of play.

Erik V, king of Excalabria, is overthrown by Tsarkon, king of Cartahena. Before he dies, Erik tells his most trusted servant, Blade, to take his infant son and the family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom, and escape, raising the baby as his own.

Eighteen years later, Tsarkon's forces approach Wyclif, the town where Blade took the baby, requiring Blade to reveal the boy's true identity as Prince of Excalabria and sending him off to save the land by collecting a series of rings starting with the Ring of Wisdom.</desc>

    <desc>Yuko Ahso is an ordinary grammar school student, but she is also the Valis.

"I defeated King Rogles of the Dark World with the Sword which was given to me by Queen Valia, but my friend Reiko died in the process..."

Yuko hasn't the slightest idea if she will be summoned to fight again.

"YUKO..."

"That voice is... uh...!? Reiko?
Why?! Reiko is Dead, isn't she..?!"

"Go and see Queen Valia, Yuko..."

Who is Megas, Yuko's new enemy? Now, the new adventure for Yuko has begun!

--from the Sega Genesis Syd of Valis instruction manual

Gameplay:

SYD of Valis is a reworked version of the action-platformer Valis II with simplified gameplay and a "Super Deformed" and kid-friendlier graphic design.

In the game you play as Yuko (Syd in the localized version), a teenage schoolgirl that can wield the magical sword of Valis and must travel to the dreamworld of Vekanti to defeat the evil lurking within it.

The game plays as a side-scrolling action platformer, in which you avoid obstacles by running and jumping around, and must defeat enemies by striking them with your blade. You can collect power-ups that include different weapons and armor types, all of which you can equip at any time during the game. 

Hints:

- Get Rid of Music -
To get rid of the music, simultaneously press B and Start at the title screen. You have to reinput the code each time you lose a life.

- Invincibility -
Enter the following code at the Title screen....
Up - Down - Left - Right - A - B - Up - Down
Then when you play the game you will be invincible

    <name>Sylvester &amp; Tweety in Cagey Capers</name>
    <path/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Another Warner Bros licensed title. You are Sylvester (the cat) and you have to catch Tweety (the bird)

This game is a 2d side-scrolling action, platform and reflexion game. In order to catch tweety you will have to solve many puzzles, which become more and more difficult as you progress into the game.

Gameplay:

Players play as Sylvester and he must try and catch Tweety in each level. You must chase Tweety to the end of the level until Sylvester finally catches him. There are however characters from the Looney Tunes universe such as Granny, Hippety Hopper and Big Tweety who will try to stop you. Sylvester can pick up things such as boxing gloves and bones to fight these enemies. He can also use things such as umbrellas and boxes to try and reach Tweety. He also has "Tweety scope" which locates where Tweety is.

Sylvester can also hide from his enemies behind lamps or in barrels. Depeding on what difficulty you choose at the beginning of the game depends on how far you can get. If you only put the difficulty at 0% you can only do 1 level. You can also gain points by knocking things off the shelves or from bags of catnip.

- Levels -

Domestic Devils- The first level is in Granny's house, which means that Granny and Spike are guarding Tweety. The player chases Tweety from the living room all the way to the attic.

Domestic Devils 2- The backyard is full of different challenges. From the picket fence to the clothesline and electrical wires, Sylvester must calm Spike down in order to pursue Tweety up into the heights of his bird house.

Mayhem Express- From the luggage car to the train roof, Sylvester must pursue Tweety out of the train. But beware of freight doors which suck Sylvester back to the beginning of the level. Figure out how Hipperty Hopper actually helps Sylvester out of the level!

Back Alley Blues- A fence and an alleyway hide a huge apartment building which Tweety is trying to get to. Sylvester has to use flag polls and window ledges to trap Tweety and also avoid the alley cats, which pelt Sylevester with boots and books. Rocky and Mugsy can be seen as a silhouette in the apartment windows, as well as Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier and Hipperty Hopper.

Hyde and Shriek- Sylvester has followed Tweety into Dr Jekyll's lab, and Tweety has swallowed some of the formula which turns him into a giant Tweety. The only thing to use against the monster is a bottle of Antidote potion. Avoid the Tweety monster, but resume the chase when Tweety shrinks down to his original size.

Hyde and Shriek 2- Sylevster has swallowed another of Jekyll's potions which shrinks him down. The smallest of beaks now becomes the biggest of obstacles in this oversized version of the lab. Watch out for bunsen burners and electric sparks. Use the transporter to change locations quickly.

Oceans of Trouble- This is the last level which takes place on a boat. Sylevester must fight his old enemies again for the last time to reach Tweety. Jump from the dock to a maze of portholes. Head up to the deck to eventually capture Tweety.

Syndicate is an isometric strategy game developed by Bullfrog Productions. It was released among other systems for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD.

The game puts the player in charge of a self-named corporation in a gritty near-future cyberpunk-style world. Game play involves ordering a four-person team of cyborg agents around cities displayed in a fixed-view isometric style, in pursuit of mission goals such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, "persuading" civilians and scientists to join the player's company or simply killing all enemy agents.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>The #1 arcade shooting game of all time explodes onto Genesis. You're a T-800 terminator with an awesome array of weapons: rapid-fire machine gun, shotgun, rockets and an M-79 grenade launcher. Blast endoskeletons and Hunter Killers... terminate the liquid-metal T-1000 or be terminated!

Gameplay:

Running on the once-popular Williams/Midway Y-Unit arcade hardware, the 2 players essentially take part in controlling a T-800 model and gun down the terminators of the opposing side in a light gun style fashion, even though the controller was technically a joystick. The gameplay utilizes a first-person perspective, like the rest of the games in the genre, but what was noteworthy about T2 was the use of digitized actors from footage specially shot during the making of the film. This made for realistic 2D sprites in a Light gun game for the time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert Patrick, and Eddie Furlong all reprised their respective roles for the making of the arcade game. Linda Hamilton does not play Sarah Connor in any footage of the game; she is instead played by Debbie Evans.

In the demo sequence, the game has been rated "R" (for Righteous) by the Motion Picture Gaming Association of America.

Hints:

- Level Skip -
When the words 'Press Start' appear on the title screen, press Up, Down, Left and Right twice. You know the cheat will work if Arnie says 'excellent'. To skip the level, pause the game and press B and C together to be taken to the analysis screen.

- Unlimited Firepower -
To get unlimited firepower use a rapid fire controller.

    <desc>Tails in Sonic 1 is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis originally created by drx which featured Tails as a playable character instead of Sonic. Tails can fly, spindash and swim in the same way that he can in Sonic 3.

On June 8, 2007, Puto released an update to Tails in Sonic 1, which featured several improvements over the original hack: bugfixes, a corrected palette and Sonic 2-styled tired and swimming sprites. More bugfixes have been released since, and on 12/31/07, he released version 2.0, completely rewritten from scratch.

Outcasts from Earth sent away to the far reaches of the unvierse return in powerful warships and begin getting revenge, attacking both the planet and its outposts around the Solar System. The Earth Defense League sends its warriors out to retaliate; each warrior is armed with a cyborg suit that makes them powerful enough to take on the outcasts.</desc>

    <desc>Your mission is to penetrate a hostile communist military force situated inside Russian territory. The player takes control of a Harrier fighter jet with two types of main weapons. The first type can only shoot flying opponents, such as enemy planes and copters; the second, a bomb-type weapon, can only hit ground enemies, such as tanks and turrets. The player can also acquire escorts to increase fire power. Changing the formation of the escort fighters results in different shot patterns and also affects the maneuvering speed.

Hints:

- Level Skip -
Before you turn on your Genesis hold Down + A. When the title screen appears release Down + A and press Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, A, C, B. - Level Skip (press Start + A while playing)

    <desc>Taz-Mania is a 1992 platform game developed by Recreational Brainware and released by Sega in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. It is based on the cartoon series with the same name, and stars Taz the Tazmanian Devil on the search for seabird eggs. It is unrelated to the Super Nintendo and Game Boy games with the same name, aside from the Taz-Mania license.

Taz-Mania was a fairly popular game, and received good reviews when it was released for being one of the first games to look like a Warner Bros. cartoon (previous attempts had been held back by hardware restraints). The game was followed by Taz in Escape from Mars.</desc>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Tecmo Cup Football Game is a 1993 video game published by Sega with license from Tecmo for the Mega Drive/Genesis and released only in Europe. The game greatly resembles the Captain Tsubasa series and games in appearance of characters and gameplay. A similar game was released a year before for the Nintendo Entertainment System under the title Tecmo Cup Soccer Game.

With the success that Tecmo had with the Captain Tsubasa games in Japan, the company was inspired to release a similar game outside Japan, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The result was Tecmo Cup Football Game, a Captain Tsubasa clone featuring a nearly identical looking, only avoiding the original Captain Tsubasa characters' and instead replacing them with similar redesigned ones, following characteristics from the German ethnicity (mostly spiky blonde/brown hair and large blue eyes) along with using western names. The Captain Tsubasa game engine was reused.

Features:

Unlike other soccer simulators, Tecmo Cup Football Game plays more like a role-playing game. The player runs around the field normally, but when he comes into contact with an opposing team member, a turn-based 'battle' is initiated. The player then has the option to perform a variety of moves such as dribbling, tackling and shooting, in addition to player-specific moves, some of which are physics-defying and destructive.

Though sporting the addictive novel gameplay of the Captain Tsubasa games, Tecmo Cup Football Game fared poorly in sales due to lack of marketing by Tecmo and its reputation as a mere rip-off [2] of Captain Tsubasa. Thus, this game is virtually unheard of even amongst hardcore fans of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

    <desc>Tecmo Super Baseball is a professional baseball video game that was released in 1994 for the Super NES and Sega Mega Drive gaming systems. It features all 28 MLB teams that existed at the time. However, the only license the game has is the MLBPA license. This means that while the game does feature actual players, there are no team names or logos. The teams wear uniforms without logos and are only named by their city (the teams that share the cities of Chicago and New York are separated by having either an A or N after their name, denoting their league).

Gameplay:

- Pre-Season -
This is a single exhibition game between any two teams. The player can face the computer, play against another player, or let the computer go at it. In addition, there is the coach option, which allows the player to act as a manager. In this mode, the player selects what kind of pitches will be thrown and what kind of batting swings will be taken, but then lets the computer execute the actions.

- Season -
The player selects the status of all 28 teams (play, coach, watch, or skip) and goes through a complete season (the schedule is based on the 1993 season), ending with the playoffs and finally the World Championship Series. Along the way, stats are kept for every team and player in the league.

- Super Stars -
A game can be played between the Super Star teams (a copyright-free name for the All-Star teams). Players can use either the All-Star teams from 1993 or draft their own team.

- Team Data -
Here, players can view all of the players' statistics from 1993, as well as their statistics for the game's current season, if one is in progress.

    <name>Tecmo Super Bowl III: Final Edition</name>
    <path/>

    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>A late entry in what was once the premiere football simulation, TSB III has updated rosters and teams for the 1994-1995 season and is licensed by both the NFL and the Players group. Features real NFLP players and photos, the real NFL schedule, and weekly standings. You can change defensive and offensive formations, create your own Pro Bowl, fake punts and field goals, go for the two point conversion, and call audibles. Updates to the game itself include new cinema screens, superstar mode, free agency system, improved graphics, larger field simulation, passing modes, and improved speech and music. Horizontal scrolling. Also features battery back-up.

Gameplay:

Tecmo Super Bowl 3 is the final Tecmo football game to be released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. Nintendo Power magazine featured it on its short-lived feature that specialized in sports games. The full NFL license is used and the action is realistic for a side-view football game.

The game is closer to the real-life sport in comparison to its NES predecessors in several ways. Each team has a playbook of 8 passing plays and 8 running plays, any one of which can be switched out and another put in its place in the middle of a game. It also included some of the more nuanced strategies of football, such as attempting two-point conversions, and onside kicks. Also setting itself apart from the NES-era games was the in-game presentation, which is more akin to the realistic "TV style" presentation of modern football games like the Madden series. After a big offensive play, or a turnover or sack on defense, a box would appear on screen with a small grayscale picture of the player involved alongside his current statistics for the game.

The series' shift towards greater realism is also reflected in the game's season mode, which included a full 16-game NFL schedule and playoffs. Firstly, it records fairly detailed statistics of each game, and records and save cumulative statistics for each team in the league throughout the season. Also throughout the season the game would maintain a list of leaders across the league in each major statistical category, and would record when a player or team broke an NFL record. The rosters for each team can also be customized by the user, and the stating lineup of a user-controlled team can be changed at any point in Season mode. Tecmo Super Bowl III's season mode also features occasional injuries, which would last for varied amounts of time just as in real life.

    <desc>Tecmo Super Bowl 2 was an update of the previous Tecmo Super Bowl released on Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Mega Drive/Genesis. TSB 2 was released on Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994. The game still had all of Tecmo's revolutionary features (breaking tackles), but now teamed with the NFL Players Association, the game had names for nearly all of its players, with a few players still under generic names (Like WR Niners).

The game also added a new feature, Player Trades. Gamers were allowed to trade for four weeks before the season. For the first time, Jerry Rice could play for the Cowboys, or Deion Sanders could play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game was somewhat well known when it was released, but now, the game is relatively rare.

    <desc>What do you get when you take one of the greatest sports games for the platform and add improved graphics, more players, more plays and lifelike AI? You get Tecmo Super Bowl, a superb football game that is the precusor to any modern day football game. Choose your team from the 28 NFL teams (this is 1991) with real players from those teams and the ability to sub in offensive players! Unlike its predecessor, in Tecmo Super Bowl, you can pick your plays from a playbook for a total of eight different plays! You can also save your season stats as the season goes on, along with your game via battery. All your favorite NFL players are here. But on some eye black, don your pads and get ready for bone-crushing football action!

Gameplay:

Tecmo Super Bowl expanded on the features used first in Tecmo Bowl. To do this, TSB replicated certain aspects of the National Football League's version of American football.

Every team in TSB was modeled after a real life NFL franchise. The teams used the same logos and the same city affiliations used by the NFL. As in real life, each team had its own offensive playbook, but unlike real life the defense must simply chose from the offensive team's plays in an attempt to anticipate specific plays (thus, there are no specific defensive plays or formations).

In the original NES Tecmo Bowl, each team had 20 players on its roster, with nine players for offense, nine players for defense, a kicker, and a punter. In Tecmo Super Bowl, each roster had roughly 30 different players. Each team had eleven defensive players, which could not be substituted, nor injured. Each team had seventeen offensive players, which included eleven starters and six substitutes. At any given time, eleven players were on the field for each team, consistent with NFL rules. A kicker and a punter were also on the roster.[2][3]

In addition to using real teams and players, TSB incorporated the full-length 1991 NFL regular season schedule for the game. The playoff format, including the Super Bowl and the post-season Pro Bowl games, was also used.

Tecmo Super Bowl retained the arcade-style football gameplay of the original which included the ability to break tackles (many players had "94" hitting power ratings, giving them the ability break any non-sliding tackles). However, the game added new features, such as statistics tracking that included All-Time NFL season records, expanded and editable playbooks[4], the ability to substitute players, varying conditions of players, fumbles, and player injuries. As it had previously, the game used cutscenes for important events like touchdowns and halftime shows. Tecmo Super Bowl also added cutscenes when injuries or big plays occurred.

    <desc>Tecmo's first and only hockey game for the Genesis features an NHLPA license for real players with ratings based on the 1993-94 season. Players are rated in speed, agility, stamina, passing, shot accuracy and stick handling, while goalies have additional ratings in defending left and right. The game is played from a horizontal view of the ice as one or two players compete in a Season, All-Star or Preseason game. Options include three levels of difficulty, three game speeds, adjustable period lengths (5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes), line changes (none, automatic or manual), fights and penalties (icing, offsides, interference and personal fouls).

Individual team statistics, standings and season progress are saved to battery, as well as league leaders in total goals, goal percentage, GAA, total assists, save percentage, total points, number of shutouts and PIM. Cinema screens will appear whenever you lay out an opponent with a devastating check or blast a slapshot past the goalie, and you can also review your shots with instant replay. Sports fans take note: Tecmo Super Hockey does not include an NHL license for authentic teams and logos, so clubs are represented by city name only. Unlike Tecmo's other 16-bit sports titles, this game was only released on the Genesis platform.

Gameplay:

Tecmo's take on ice hockey, Tecmo Super Hockey features the license from the NHLPA, having the top players of the game at the time. It offers exhibition and regular games as well as playing a season with updated stats and the ability to play in the All-Star game as well. Gameplay is similar to other games, with buttons to pass, shoot, making slap-shots and fake shots, as well as fighting, which is not a common feature. It can be played by two players simultaneously.

    <name>The Duel: Test Drive II</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent.

Directions:

Take the ultimate car on the road for a test drive. Put the pedal the metal and speed past the opposition, watch for traffic and make sure that you do not get caught by the police for speeding. Select scenery to drive by and blow past it to take first place!

Gameplay:

The player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use and automatic or manual transmission--the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player's car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course.

The goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, a thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left.

Police cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player's car get in front of it, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn't cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.

In the standard version of Test Drive II, the player has the option of using one of two vehicles (three in the SNES and Genesis versions of the game). These vehicles are presented at the beginning of the game with technical specifications, including top speed, torque, and acceleration rates. The cars included are:

- Porsche 959
- Ferrari F40
- Lamborghini Diablo (only in the SNES and Genesis versions)

For non-console versions, Accolade later released two data disks, which included more playable cars. These were released on many platforms.

The Supercars car disk included cars from the previous game in the series, some in slightly different versions:
- Corvette ZR1
- Ferrari Testarossa
- Lamborghini Countach
- Lotus Turbo Esprit (1988 model)
- Ruf "Yellowbird" Twin Turbo - a modified Porsche 911

The Musclecars car disk included five muscle cars from the 60's:
- Camaro C.O.P.O. 9560 ZL-1 (1969)
- Corvette Stingray (1963)
- Dodge Charger Daytona (1969)
- Mustang Shelby GT500 Cobra (1968)
- Pontiac GTO (1967)

The computer versions of the game provided one course, referred to by the game as "Master Scenery", consisting of several stages. Each stage had one of three possible locations: a desert, with cacti along the side of the road; a mountain, with a sheer rock wall on one side of the highway and a cliff on the other, and occasionally a tunnel through the mountain; and a grassy area with trees.

Later, two "scenery disks" were released, each containing an additional course:

- California Challenge, which included seven stages, each representing a section of a southbound crossing of the state of California.
- European Challenge, which allowed players to travel through six different European countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, and Spain.

There are four available courses in the console versions of the game, each of varying length and difficulty. Each is a route on a public highway in a different part of the continental United States. The courses included are:

- "Desert Blast (Easy)" - Seemingly takes place somewhere in the US Southwest.
- "City Bound (Medium)" - It is not entirely clear where this takes place, but in various parts of the course, Mount Rushmore can be seen.
- "East Coast (Hard)" - Takes place in the eastern U.S., with the last section of the course including a view of the New England coast.
- "West Coast (Hardest)" - Takes place in the United States West Coast and is the longest and most difficult course in the game. The Seattle skyline and Space Needle can be seen in the beginning parts of the course.

Controls:

A Button: Brake
B Button: Accelerate
C Button: N/A
Start Button: Pause

Hints:  

- Sound Options -
Hold A, B, and C while driving to open an options screen. You can turn the music and sound effects on or off from here. 

- Turbo Thrust -
For a quick burst of turbo speed during a race, hit A on Controller Two.

- Custom Car -
During a race, simultaneously hit L, R, Y, X, B, and A on Controller Two. Release all buttons, and you can now make changes on the Customize Car screen that appears. Press Start on Controller Two to return to the race.

It was developed alongside Sega's System-16 arcade version, but never reached shelves after legal wranglings gave Nintendo exclusive console rights. However, that little issue doesn't stop some people from obtaining it. Apparently, there are about 10 copies known to be floating around.

    <desc>Theme Park is a management simulator developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1994. It was released for a variety of systems, including the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Mega CD, Sega Saturn in the following year.

Theme Park was the first successful theme park simulator, and would go on to inspire other Theme games and the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. Players are given a plot of land and are tasked with buying (and creating) rides, as well as organising the general layout of the park, staff and attempting to keep visitors happy without going bankrupt.

From a Sega perspective the game is fairly interesting - the game was technically released twice in Japan, first as regular Theme Park seen here, and again as Shin Theme Park, a localised variant. The game was originally designed with a mouse in mind, but none of the Sega ports are compatible with their respective mouse add ons, whether that be the Sega Mouse or Shuttle Mouse.

Theme Park would later see a true sequel in the form of the fully 3D Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in North America) in 1999.</desc>

    <desc>Thunder Force III is a 1990 shoot-'em-up developed by Tecnosoft for the Sega Mega Drive and released exclusively in the US and Japan. It is the third game in the Thunder Force series and the first to debut on a Sega console. It was brought to the arcades as Thunder Force AC.

Immediately after the events of Thunder Force II, the Galaxy Federation discovers five cloaking devices on five planets circling the ORN Empire's main base, and that any attempt to destroy these cloaking devices will result in ORN's Cerberus destroyer, capable of detecting and destroying large fleets, to take action. With this knowledge, the Galaxy Federation builds a new ship that is both powerful enough to destroy the five cloaking devices yet small enough to avoid detection by Cerberus.</desc>

    <desc>Thunder Force II, known in Japan as Thunder Force II MD, is the second installment of the Thunder Force series of shoot-'em-ups by Technosoft. Initially released in 1988 for the Sharp X68000, it was ported to the Sega Mega Drive and released internationally in 1989. It was the first Sega Mega Drive game in Japan, and by extension, the first game on a Sega console, published by a third party.

After the events of the first Thunder Force, the defeated ORN Empire decide to attack the Galaxy Federation again. Using Plealos, their new battleship, ORN is able to destroy the planet Reda and take the planet Nepura as their own. Fortunately, the Galaxy Federation discovers Nepura is used to hold Plealos when it is not being used, and they set out to destroy Plealos.</desc>

    <name>The Tick</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>
    <video/>
    <marquee/>
    <desc>There's a new superhero in town, and he's a seven-foot tall, 400-pound arachnid! Join the tongue-in-cheek action, as you guide the unlikely hero through colorful levels of high-stress action. Based on the hit cartoon series of the same name, THE TICK pits you against some rather unusual enemies--ninjas, hoods, and clowns--who all seem to have it in for you in this extensive tale of crime fighting. You do have some extremely rare combat techniques, but then?you're not exactly the most common savior. Back-to-back fighting lets you control two characters at the same time, while detailed characters give the title the look and feel of real arcade game. Do you have what it takes to save the world? Let's hope so.

Directions:

Begin your super hero quest with Chapter One, "The Night of a Million Zillion Ninjas". Oh, they mean it. Ninjas galore. O.K. So there may not be a million zillion exactly, but I'm sure it's close. Give those ninjas a super hero spanking by punching and kicking them over and over.

The main thing here is not to fall off the bus. Other than that, those puny little ninjas do little damage to the nigh-invulnerable Tick, though this won't always be the case as newer and stronger ninjas appear in later chapters. Oh, and don't worry. You will eventually be fighting goons other than ninjas.

Land three punches and the fourth will be a power punch. Land two kicks and the third will be a power kick. Tick also has one air move. Press C while in the air to do a kick in the air. In addition to these heavy handed tactics you can call on your trusty sidekick Aurthur. Press C and B at the same time to call for Arthur. Arthur will fly across the screen and take out all of the enemies on the screen. You can only do this a limited number of times. The number of times you can do it is in the upper left corner of the screen with Arthur's head beside it. Pick up Arthur heads on the screen to replenish these.

You'll also find some items to help you out along the way. Extra men will look like Tick's head, and while your health refills in between each section (with the remaining health adding onto your score) there are no pick-ups that refill your health. Pick up a fist icon and a super friend will come to your aide. They will put their back to yours and every time you attack, they'll attack. Besides that, some things in the game can be interacted with, like mailboxes. Walk up to a mailbox and press B to pick it up. You can then carry it around and then throw it at an enemy to kill them with one hit (if you can manage to hit them with it, it's pretty difficult).

Hitting a ninja once will cause him to drop his weapon. Now he's less dangerous (especially those star throwing ones) and can be taken out more leisurely. Keep this in mind when you are swarmed with many enemies at once. Also watch out for a crazy super hero that will zoom across the screen, taking out enemies, and you as well if you aren't careful. There's always a high-pitched trilling whistle before this dope zooms across the screen.

You're probably thinking the ninjas on the bus will never end, but they will. Then you'll be able to move on to fighting ninjas on rooftops, and then in yards, then in alley ways, and well, you get the idea. Of course, first you'll have to make your way across an obstacle course of knives, stars, spears, and even axes being thrown at you as you jump from roof to roof. Don't worry about falling here. If you fall you will get a "Sub Plot" and you will fight someone down in the alleyway. This will make sense to anyone who ever watched the cartoon and saw Tick fall off buildings all the time. Still, it's only O.K. to fall on these screens and not on screens where you are actively fighting someone. Falling on a screen where you have enemies to combat means death.

Occasionally you will have to face super villains. These guys are all much tougher than the ninjas and you will have to avoid getting hit more seriously. Hit and run is the best tactic with these guys. They will take more hits to bring down as well. 

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Punch
C Button: Kick
Start Button: Pauses Game

Hints:

- More Bang for Your Buck -
Wait to pick up the fists until there are a few enemies on the screen. When you pick it up they will all be knocked down and lose their weapons.

    <desc>Socket, known as Time Dominator 1st in Japan, is a platform game released for the Mega Drive in 1993. It was developed and published by VIC Tokai and stars a time travelling duck named Socket, built to "fight" in the "mascot wars" initiated by the rivalry between Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The game was released in Japan and North America, but not in Europe.

Socket borrows many elements from Sonic the Hedgehog and its sequels, causing it to be labelled as a "Sonic clone". Like Sonic there is an emphasis on speed, with the game offering several "High Speed Areas" in an attempt to woo fans of Sega's game. There are also "labyrinth" areas, which have a greater emphasis on exploration of the level. Items are collected by destroying capsules, similar to Sonic, and a time attack mode is offered.</desc>

    <desc>The evil Grim Squidge has stolen all of the stars in the Galaxy, and now he's threatening to hurl everyone into the bleak Cosmic Void. Somebody's got to stop him, and that somebody is Tinhead.

Gameplay:

The gameplay is somewhat different than your typical platformer. There is some exploration required to find the exit or if you want to get health or points. You attack your enemies by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of TinHead's head. You can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The direction is chosen by using a specific button.

    <desc>Hit it big when you join Buster Bunny on a 33 stage hunt for treasure. So loaded with hare-raising animation, it's like playing in a whacked-out Tiny Toon cartoon! Do you dare to set paw on this mysterious island? Trip through 7 tangly territories that include an overly-enchanted forest, caverns of bubbling lava-lava, secret underground seas, plains that are just plain crazy, a freaky factory, a mega mountain and a spooky shipwreck rumored to be dripping in 14 carrot gold! Save Babs Bunny and the rest of your pals along the way and you'll really see some kooky island hopping. With Gogo Dodo as your guide, you can be sure this adventure is packed with tricks, traps, and hidden bonus areas!

Directions:

As mentioned in the overview, Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure plays very much like Sonic The Hedgehog in a few aspects. To begin, as Buster Bunny moves, he slowly speeds up and his legs move in quick circles in typical cartoon fashion.

Another similarity is the way you defeat enemies. You only have to avoid attacks coming at you and jump on the heads of the baddies, knocking them for a loop. There are also some features new to gamers, such as the ability to bounce wall to wall when they close in. To perform a wall bounce, jump up to a wall and then once more against it. Jumping again will perform the wall bounce which will come in handy at some points.

The typical "currency" of this game is carrots, which works in quite a big way. When you collect 50 carrots in one stage, this gives you what is called a helper. Either in the form of Lil' Beeper, Sneezer or Concord Condor, the helper can be called on to appear and take out all of the on screen enemies. Keep one close, because you never know when you'll find yourself in a bind. You begin with a life span of three hearts. To enhance your heart meter with more, you can find gold bells. Finding diamonds will make you invincible for a short period of time.

At the end of every few levels, you'll be met with certain boss fights that take the form of Tiny Toon characters such as Dizzy Devil and Montana Max. There are certain ways to fight through these and it's up to you to figure out the patterns so you can defeat them and move on.

B Button: Slide when running (attack)
C Button: Jump

    <desc>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist, known in Europe as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist and in Japan as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Return of the Shredder is a beat-'em-up sidescroller by Konami and based on the TMNT franchise. It is based heavily off the game Turtles in Time which came out on the SNES and Arcade, though it also borrows elements from the first TMNT arcade game.

The gameplay is heavily based on the gameplay of Turtles in Time, an arcade and Super Nintendo game. There is an attack button and jump button. Run is also assigned to a button whereas it was done with a double tap of the dpad or when walking a certain distance. The player can still slam enemies back and forth on the ground but can no longer throw them towards the screen. Various objects around the level can sometimes be hit and knocked into enemies and some will even explode, damaging nearby enemies. Some levels feature traps such as holes or planks which hit the player when stepped on.</desc>

    <desc>During the summer of 1996, Saturdays were traditionally spent on The Nashville Network with programming related to fishing, and this game made everyday a Saturday afternoon watching TNN on the player's cable TV or satellite TV. Even players who were stuck with terrestrial TV were interested in fishing and found it interesting, even though they couldn't afford the huge satellite dishes at the time, or lived with trees in their western angle, which made satellite broadcasting impossible until late 1998.

    <desc>ToeJam &amp; Earl is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It stars two extraterrestrial rappers who, by way of pilot error, end up crash-landing on Earth. While there, they must search for the missing pieces of their spacecraft in hopes of reassembling it. The game frequently parodies and satirizes 1990s urban culture, and includes common 90's slang and a funk soundtrack. Much of this charm is what drew people toward the game. The game was followed by Toejam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron.</desc>

    <desc>It's batter-up and time for Tommy Lasorda's version of Pro-Ball. Whether you're infield or outfield, at the plate or on the mound, stealing bases or catching fly-balls, the competition is hot and you're even hotter now that you're playing with a big leaguer like Lasorda. And you've got control. Curve balls, fastballs or sliders are some of the wind-ups you'll pitch to outwit your batter. But be prepared when he connects, you'll have to think fast to make your players perform like a well-oiled machine. Are you up for a single, double, or even triple play? It all depends on how you throw the ball. But don't worry, you'll get your chance at bat. This is a race for the Pennant, so you better hope Tommy's on your side. Now take your pick, choose your line-up and let's play ball!

    <desc>Tony La Russa Baseball is a baseball computer and video game console sports game series (1991-1997), designed by Don Daglow, Mark Buchignani, David Bunnett and Hudson Piehl and developed by Stormfront Studios. The game appeared on Commodore 64, PC, and Sega Genesis, and different versions were published by Electronic Arts, SSI and Stormfront Studios. The artificial intelligence for the computer manager was provided by Tony La Russa, then manager of the Oakland Athletics and later the St. Louis Cardinals. The game was one of the best-selling baseball franchises of the 1990s.

The game was based on the baseball simulation methods Daglow evolved through the Baseball mainframe computer game (1971) (the first computer baseball game ever written), Intellivision World Series Baseball (1983) and Earl Weaver Baseball (1987).

    <desc>At last, real baseball strategy for real baseball fans. Match wits with the major league manager of the year Tony La Russa in the most realistic baseball simulation ever created for the Sega Genesis. Pull your infield in, play your outfield at the warning track, send in a pinch hitter to dig in and crank that hanging curve into another time zone! Send 'em to the showers, put on the hit and run, pull the suicide squeeze - you're the manager - you make the calls! Digitized pitcher and batter animations - is it a slider or a smokin' fastball?

Hints:

- Guaranteed Home Runs Glitch -

Both Francisco Cabrera of the Braves and Joe Magrane of the Cardinals have their slugging percentage listed incorrectly in the game; both are listed as having Slugging Percentages of well over 1.000. Because of this, you are guaranteed to hit a home run when either player makes contact while swinging for power.

Note that in the case of Cabrera, this glitch only works if he's batting 7th in the lineup.

- Nearly one-man team -

In the Texas Rangers roster, Julio Franco is listed six times and all six can be in the starting line-up together.

- Roster Glitch -

Before you start a game, select "See Lineups". Not only can you edit position players and batting order and such in your own lineup, but the game allows you to do so for the other team as well.

This means that you can force the other team to yield a unit of scrubs all in the wrong position and throw out the worst pitcher on their roster on a daily basis. Have fun enjoying all the free wins.

    <name>Top Fighter 2000: MK VIII</name>
    <path/>
    <image/>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>If there's something you can count on this world, it's bootlegs. They've been around since the first multi-game consoles, and come doomsday they'll still be making their way into shady Taiwanese warez markets. Here at Sega-16 we've resolved to document the unlicensed games that fall into our domain, and today's feature is the third in the 'Hacks and Homebrews' series. So far we've covered a Mario-deficient Mario game and a gaggle of amateur demos. Today comes another round of hacking goodness, one that goes by the eyebrow-raising name of Top Fighter 2000: MK VIII.

I did a little research, and from what I can tell this game was actually released in cartridge form. As is common with bootlegs, very few were ever pressed and those that were...well, let's just say that they aren't popping up on eBay all the time. So what we're mostly looking at in the case of Top Fighter is as a download - which you can find at the bottom of this page. I played it in Kega Fusion 3.51, but it works in the latest version of Gens as well. Feel free to give it a whirl after you read the article; just don't get your hopes up on finding a copy.

The first thing you'll say to yourself upon booting up the ROM is "what have we here?" At least I did, but then again I said it in a Lando Calrissian voice, too. Whatever your reaction may be, staring out of your computer monitor will be two vaguely familiar faces. Upon closer inspection those faces will be none other than Mohammad Ali and Michael Jordan. At first I couldn't believe it, but then the demo mode began to play. Here we're treated to a surreal sequence in which Mohammad Ali dances like a butterfly and stings what appears to be Antoine Walker like a bee. After that we see Jordan doing a slam dunk. But that's not the best part " the grand final is when profile shots of the two sportsmen slide onscreen and suddenly we see the actual character sprites for the fighting engine.

I'd been expecting Jordan to be either Shaq from Shaq Fu or himself from the SNES title Chaos in the Windy City. I guess I didn't give these bootleggers enough credit. Now, I haven't played every fighting game out there, but it seems to me that these are brand new sprites! The art quality is surprising for this sort of production, as is the rather fluid animation. To make things even more overwhelming, the rest of the roster scrolls across screen shortly after. Cyclops, Geese, Ryu, Goku, Kyo, Ryo...the gang's all here, guys.

Albeit with a few misspellings.

Michael Jordan has become simply "Jodan," something I find incredibly funny; Geese has been truncated as well and is now "Gees"; Cyclops has been shorted to "Cycl". My momentary illusions of having found the perfect bootleg have been dispelled, but there's still a lot of interesting stuff to consider: a neat opening, snazzy title screen, some options to choose from, a two player mode, and an intriguing roster of well-animated characters. 

Gameplay:

Fighting is conducted in a sort of dumbed-down version of the standard Street Fighter II setup, using only two buttons and a maximum of six standard combat moves. Each fighter then has a handful of special moves that use the predictable QCF, QCB, and DP combinations - familiar ground for anyone who's played a few rounds of any sort of versus fighter. Combos are very much a possibility for those inclined to mess around with them, from what I can tell. An interesting addition is a desperation move power meter, a feature absent from almost all of the official Genesis fighters.

It's clear that this is not an early effort; I'd place it sometime around '98. (Or maybe even 2000 like the title screen claims.) For one thing, Ryu's sprite is not of the Street Fighter II variety. It's actually a modified Alpha sprite set, and I must say that it's a beautiful change of pace to see the new artwork on our beloved Genesis. And speaking of artwork, things only get better after the title screen. The backgrounds are vivid, although mostly static, and the characters are popping with color. Kyo looks washed out; a notable exception to a generally vibrant presentation. Kudos to you bootleg coders and artists, wherever you are. Ya done good. As did the guys handling the sound. The narrator sounds just as good as professional entries. The audio could have used a little more variety, but the fighters actually call out their attacks and the sampling is crisp - crisper than Eternal Champions, at any rate.

The music is not as good, not because of any technical problem but because the melodies simply aren't memorable. Considering how much plagiarism is going on with the rest of the game, it's interesting that the music isn't copied as well.

But to summarize on the presentation...man, I can't believe I'm saying this...Top Fighter is probably the flashiest fighter on the Sega Genesis. It sounds crazy, but play the game and you'll see what I mean. The special moves are all inspired by Street Fighter Alpha and a generation of over-the-top versus fighters not yet conceived during the official life span of the Genesis. These Asian hackers, influenced by games that the design teams of the Genesis' era didn't have access to, have put together a fighting experience with much more pizzazz than anything Sega could crank out at the time. The fireball attacks are most explosive than the Hadokens in Super Street Fighter II; some of the special moves have a 'shadowing' effect not implemented in any other official fighter.

    <desc>You are a driver. Race down the track at supersonic speed and earn money to pimp your ride. Use nitros to burst past opponents with huge amounts of speed. Win the race. Beat out the world's best.

Directions:

Race your racecar among 19 others and win. 

Gameplay:

In this sequel, the game becomes more realistic, with a damage bar on the left side of the screen, slower cars, and the possibility to upgrade your machine. The cars become more difficult to handle and the opponents are faster and tougher than in the previous game. The new addition of weather also plays a role, forcing the player to change from dry to wet tires.

The game takes place in 16 countries including 64 cities, starting with Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). After each country is beaten, the player is given a password, which can be later used to pick the game back up from that position.

The actual gameplay is quite simple, there is a map showing which directions the upcoming turns will be, and the player is given 6 "nitro boosts" at the start, which dramatically increase the cars speed for a short period of time. On certain courses there are pickups along the road ranging from a "$" which is $1,000 cash, a "N" which is an extra "nitro boost", and a "S" which is an automatic nitro administered right when picked up and returns each lap. The other pickups can only be collected once per race.

The player has the option of either an automatic or manual gearshift, and can configure the controls as they please at the opening menu of the game.

Hints:

- Using Nitro - 
Only use nitros when the race begins, and on straight stretches. Because if you use the Nitros at the beginning, you'll be able to go through a lot of other cars, and go up the ranks faster. Be careful, because if you hit someone on the way through, it goes on your car as damage, and your car's top speed goes down. And on straight stretches, use them. Because if you use Nitros on curves, you'll risk hitting objects and losing valuable time.

- Your car isn't like an anti virus program with updates -
If you buy a part for a car, make sure you get the best one right away. This minimizes cost but it'll be harder because you're still working with the factory stock parts going up into the more experienced drivers. But remember, if you've got an upgrade, never ever select the stock item, because this will give your upgrade away, and you won't get any money back. 

- Get a Dodge Viper -
At the start screen scroll down to the options and enter. Once there scroll to cheats. At the cheats menu simply enter (5anniversary). No parenthesis are included. This game was themed with the 5th anniversary of the Dodge Viper creation in 1989. Its no better then any other car in the game it just looks different.

5anniversary: Car that looks like a Dodge Viper

    <desc>Named after the tactic invented by Rinus Michels and their "Clockwork Oranges" Dutch team of the 70's, Total Football is an International competition game including 52 teams (including an all-star team) and compete in a 16 team league, 32 team knockout and a 32 team tournament similar to the World Cup.

Featuring a low-angle isometric view (not compensated by the d-pad, meaning pressing right will move the player along the half-way line (his right), not in the direction of the right corner flag (the screens' right) like in most games featuring axonometric views, while buttons allow to pass the ball in different strengths or kick at goal. Managing is limited to the choice of eight different formations at the start of the game and half-time.

Options include the usual in the genre: half length (3,5,10,20 and 45 minutes), weather conditions (sunny, rainy, overcast, indoors), referee strictness (full, no cards, no fouls), time stoppages, tie decision (shootout or overtime) and sound (music and sfx, only one of them or none).

They've sent an army of Radiation Rangers to annihilate the Toxic Crusaders with fighter choppers, radioactive gunk and barrels of nuclear slime. Toxie and his pals have a heap of fighting on their hands!

Clean-freak Toxie incinerates the scum patrol with laser blasts. Never one to leave litter around, he scours up the mess with his mop and the help of his pal Bloobie.

NoZone, the beak-faced crusader, has class - er, make that crass. He spits hot blobs (and can this guy aim!) and speeds around on his wheelie foot. One mule-kick from this bird decorates the slime spreaders with tread marks before they croak.

Junkyard thrives on punching out polluters, spin jumping and licking up the leftover sludge. He really takes the bite out of grime!

The superheroes are in for non-stop combat, especially when they board the Smogulan mothership. Hold your breath (and your nose) when the Toxic Crusaders take their down and dirty war to the most poisonous planet in outer space!

    <desc>Toy Story is a Sega Mega Drive game based on the film with the same name developed by Traveller's Tales and Psygnosis and published by Sega. Similar versions were also released for the Game Boy, Super Nintendo and Windows PCs.

As well as having platforming segments, the game is notable for being one of the few Sega Mega Drive games to have a stage in the first-person perspective, something that the Mega Drive was not expected to be able to handle. As well as this, one of the other technical feats was the MOD player in this game, allowing the Mega Drive to play back Amiga music files, specifically used for the menu screen and credits. This is the only game on the Mega Drive to include the player.</desc>

    <desc>An irresponsible young man wouldn't take over the company and now his father is dying. In order to get his young adult son to accept his new responsibilities, the father must force him to reclaim his toy factory from a strait-laced Army sergeant that he has appointed as part of a "test of maturity." this results in the player fighting against armies of military-style toys with your own action figure armies.

Gameplay:

The player will start each level only possessing a limited supply of toys, whereas the sergeant will have a virtually unlimited supply of toys to throw at the player. Only with skillful strategy can the toy factory be reclaimed from its authoritarian factory manager.

    <desc>From space, a menacing fortress appears in the sky. Surrounding it, a "trampoline" sidewalk armed with bombs and patrolled by enemy invaders. You, the Trampoline Terror, have the guts to fight back. Stealthful observation reveals self-destruct switches planted on 32 strongholds. Triggering each one will be no simple task. Powerful alien patrols will thwart your efforts, pushing you to the edge... and beyond! And beware the trampolines, whose very structure weakens with your every jump. Only your bounding skill and sharp cunning can save the day. So hop to it!

Directions:

The objective of the game is to activate every mine/switch in the level without falling off or getting hit by an enemy.

You've got two skills, Jumping and Throwing. There is only one thing you can throw, the black tubs. If you have any just press B to throw them in front of you. Normally they only go one square's distance, but if they land on a trampoline they will keep going.
Jump! The jump is your friend and enemy. By jumping on the trampolines, you wear them out, but you move faster and are harder to hit. If you hold the jump button when you land/jump from a trampoline you will jump extra high and will be able to reach platforms that are farther away. In other words you can jump over one square of empty space.

Controls:  

A Button: Jump
B Button: Throw object
C Button: Jump
Start Button: Jump

Hints:

- Debug Mode -
Enter the following code at the Title screen....
Hold A + B + C + Up and press Start - Start
Then you should go to a debug room where you can choose your level and lives

    <desc>How would you like to have the best arm in football? You can... all 28 NFL teams. Over 100 real offensive plays and over 50 defensive plays. Battery back-up to save your stats. Design your own plays, team and your own season! Go head-to-head or be the coach. Super smooth animation and life-like stadium sound. Real weather conditions that affect your game play. Troy's a back-to-back Super Bowl champion quarterback. Can you be one?

Gameplay:

Troy Aikman NFL Football is an Atari Jaguar, Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis American football video game where players can play exhibition matches, season matches, playoff matches, make their own plays for use on the field, and even pays salaries to his players. Each season schedule can either be customized (to the player's exact specifications) or the player can use the schedule from the 1993 NFL season. There is limited voice capability with the referee having a vocabulary of less than 10 words. In newer games, both the referee and the announcer would have a combined vocabulary of more than 1000 different words and nicknames for the players.

Aikman is the first member of the 1993 Dallas Cowboys to have his namesake in a game. Emmitt Smith was the second Dallas Cowboys member to have his own game titled Emmitt Smith Football; that game was released 14 months after Aikman's game.

    <desc>Turbo OutRun is an arcade sequel to OutRun released in 1989. It was released as both a stand-alone arcade cabinet and as an upgrade kit to the original OutRun. Though not the first sequel to OutRun, Turbo OutRun is considered to be the first "true" sequel, having been built by a similar team at Sega AM2 with the arcades in mind.

Though very different to the rest of the series, Turbo OutRun is arguably closer to Yu Suzuki's vision for the original OutRun, being set in the United States of America and featuring various scrapped ideas such as a checkpoint system.

Turbo OutRun wasn't as popular as the original game, but offered numerous graphical upgrades such as weather and road obstacles which would be included in other OutRun sequels to follow. Like its prequel, the player drives a car which looks suspeciously like Ferrari, however rather than being a Ferrari Testarossa, it is a Ferrari F40. Like OutRun Ferrari were not consulted during the development of this game.</desc>

    <desc>Three-headed demon Morgul has been influencing people's dreams to create nightmares, but more recently these nightmares have become real. Only Turrican can save them in this fast paced side scrolling shoot-em up. It features 5 worlds and 13 levels of challenging gameplay.

Gameplay:

Gameplay is conceptually simple: just jump, shoot and explore. However, this game puts a lot of emphasis on finding and using the 10 different weapons Turrican can collect.

An overhead scrolling fantasy shoot 'em up, Twinkle Tale casts the player in the role of the young witch Saria, in a quest to rid her magical floating island of the evil creatures that have invaded it.

Gameplay:

The game is played from an overhead perspective, with Saria having complete freedom of movement in all directions and with the objective being to clear out all enemies in all 9 stages, looting whatever treasure you can find and defeating each stage's boss.

Saria's offensive weapons come pre-defined as three different spells, which you can freely switch to at any time and level-up by collecting power stars, as well as screen-clearing bombs.

Hints:

- Level Select - 
At the story book screen when you just start a game, hold up-left, A, and C simultaneously and press start.

Translation Description:

As usual, this MIJET patch is dual language. Which region has auto-detect priority determines whether it's in English or Japanese. The script is polished appropriately and well presented.

As MIJET indicated in the readme, S. Hard appears identical in challenge to Hard. This is almost true. As you go up the difficulty settings, the general trend is an increase in enemy HP, especially boss HP. No such increase is made between Hard and S. Hard. However, the bullets and attacks are somewhat faster in S. Hard. MIJET unlocked this mode for you so you don't have to beat the game once just to do so.

    <desc>Endorsed by heavy metal hair band M?tley Cr?e, Cr?e Ball: Heavy Metal Pinball features instrumental versions of three of the band's most popular songs: Dr. Feel Good, Home Sweet Home and Live Wire. Despite their involvement with the project, the members of Motley Cr?e never make an appearance in the game.

This vertical scrolling pinball simulation is composed of nine similarly designed volumes (levels) of play, each with bumpers, gates, spinners, bunkers, ramps, bonus multipliers and more. Each volume consists of an upper screen, a middle screen, and a lower screen.

In addition to shooting for targets and other staples of the pinball genre, you must kill skeletons, maggots, killer clowns and other heavy metal monsters. Your most formidable battles may be against Craig, who is "Keeper of the Wall." In each level, the Wall, which stands between you and the Volume Knob, must be torn down in order to "Crank it Up" (advance to the next level).

After cranking it up to level nine, you must face Mr. Gore, the spirit of ANTI-METAL. To win the game, you must shoot the ball into Gore's mouth three times.

    <desc>The fight of your life... Enter the world of ULTIMATE Mortal Kombat 3 and discover what awaits you... 23 immediately playable fighters and 2 bosses. Meet up with some old adversaries. Think you know them? Guess again. They've got new combos, fatalities, brutalities and babalities and they're looking for you! There's also a few dudes playing their own version of hide and seek - find 'em if you can! Battle against the computer, opt for 2-on-2 fighting, or try out the very cool 8-fighter Tournament mode! Dazzling graphics, incredible sound and motion-capture technology produce the most realistic battles you'll ever fight!

Gameplay:

Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 combines the best of all the Mortal Kombats into a single cartridge. 23 playable characters are immediately available, such as Reptile, Cyrax, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Jax, Katana, Sonya, and more. There are two bosses that are unlockable, as well as additional characters.

There is a variety of new levels, some of which are interactive. Characters can uppercut someone, causing them to hit the ground hard and crash through to the bottom floor, or they can knocked someone off a bridge, landing in a pit of spikes.

Players can go against the computer one-on-one, two-on-two, or take part in the 8-fighter tournament.

Gameplay was identical to MK3 but introduced a few new elements. Two new tournament modes were introduced. One was entitled 2-on-2 Kombat Mode which was similar to an Endurance match but with human players on both sides. There was also a new eight player tournament mode. "Chain combos" could be started by using a jump punch (vertical or angled) or a vertical jump kick which created more comboing opportunities. Some characters were given extra combos and some combos were even damage reduced. Combos that knock opponents in the air would no longer send one's opponent to the level above in multi layered levels. Only regular uppercuts would allow for this.

Some characters were given new moves. Stryker now has a "Riot Gun" special move. Kano's cannonball move could be performed in two ways; one would make Kano move straight ahead like in MK3 and the other moved diagonally. Liu Kang and Sonya have new combos which can knock opponents in the air, leading to more combo possibilities.

Some character moves were altered a bit, in most cases to balance the gameplay. Stryker's Baton Throw and Sonya's Leg Grab were given special damage protection propertues. Kabal could not perform his ground saw move after a spin and a certain number of comboed hits, however this makes little difference though as any moves performed on someone after the ground saw can be blocked unless the opponent is in the air. Kabal's ground combo damage was also reduced by approximately 10%. Sub-Zero was toned down a bit as he can no longer create an ice clone next to the opponent to freeze him on the spot. If he tries, the statue will not form. Smoke's spear is disabled after 4 combo hits. Also worth noting, the spear actually comes out of the compartment on his chest, whereas in MK3 it was actually summoned from behind him. When Shang Tsung juggles an opponent with his fireball, there is now a minimum of two other hits needed before another fireball can be performed.

Performing a roundhouse when one's opponent is in the corner pushes the player's character out of the corner. Sonya's MK3 Friendship, which had her waving her arms back-and-forth in a silly manner, is removed. Now she simply does her victory pose and a row of flowers grow out of the ground. Other notable alterations include: Cyrax's air throw adds to the "combo meter" and his bombs cannot be done while his net is on screen. Both Cyrax and Sheeva's ground throw activates damage protection. Performing Liu Kang's bicycle kick special drains the run meter, Jax's projectiles have a longer recovery time, and both Sektor and Robot Smoke's Teleport Punch can now home in on their target better than the previous game. Kung Lao's Spin has better collision detection; no longer causes pushback in the corner; and it also now activates Damage Protection. Nightwolf's bow and arrow has reduced start up time when comboed (which just means situations where your opponent cannot control their character after being hit).

Player 1 side Sektor can fire Dumb Missiles while Homing Missiles are activated (possible glitch or incomplete programming).

Additionally several miscellaneous features were added and changed to UMK3. The original red portal background used for the "Choose Your Destiny" screen is now replaced with a blue portal and an extra "Master" difficulty is added as well. In the additional "Master" difficulty setting, "Endurance Matches" return, in which the player can face as many as three opponents in a given round. These were not seen since the first Mortal Kombat. Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures are introduced after either the main game or the 8-player tournament are completed. These Lost Treasures are selectable prizes, some are extra fights, others lead to various cutscenes or other things. The smallest alterations to the game include character announcements when Shang Tsung transforms and the "Toasty!" sound is now played during the game's end credits, when Dan Forden's image is shown.

While ROMS were added to the game and nothing was actually removed, some elements from MK3 were subsequently missing from UMK3's presenation. The only bios featured are for Kitana, Jade, Scorpion, and Reptile (the ninja characters who weren't featured in the original MK3 and do not have to be unlocked via Ultimate Kombat Kode in this game). All of the bios and the full body portrait of each character from MK3 are missing. The bios that are featured use their versus screen portrait with text on a background of the battleplan/portal. Like the bios, all of the character endings show the player's character's versus screen picture accompanied by text, instead of using original art as MK3 did (a spelling mistake, however, in Sindel's ending is corrected). The storyline pictures and accompanying text are never shown (beginning with "These are the words of Raiden" and explaining the plan to conquer Earth and the Tournament warriors' struggle).

Finally, The Bank, the only stage missing from MK3, was removed completely from gameplay.

In UMK3, the CPU AI was improved. However, it introduced two flaws: while backflipping away from an opponent, if the player performs a jump kick, the CPU will always throw a projectile. This leaves the CPU vulnerable to attacks such as Sektor's teleport-uppercut, which can easily lead into a devastating combo and if the player walks back-and-forth, not getting too close to the CPU opponent and not walking too far away from it, the CPU will mimic the player's walking movements the entire round and never attack. This gameplay flaw remained and was not corrected for Mortal Kombat Trilogy. In addition, UMK3 1.1 AI was used instead of 1.2, which is even less developed AI.

This game is rated M on the Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, Genesis, Saturn, and SNES versions. On the last three versions, it is rated M for Realistic Violence and Realistic Blood and Gore; for the Nintendo DS and Xbox 360 the M rating is for Blood and Gore and Intense Violence.

    <desc>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.

The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.

    <desc>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:

- Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.

- Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.

- Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.

- Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.

- Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...

- Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.

Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.

During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

Hints:

- Less attacks -
Enter Black Beard as a name.

- Faster battles -
Hold Y at the battle screen when it is your opponent's turn.

- Black market -
Wait until 2:00 a.m. and go to the item shops at the ports. The Crusader Sword may be found at the shop at Timbuktu.

- Easy money -
Accept the Collect Debt job in the Venice guild after starting a new game. Get the five gold ingots, deposit in the bank, and return to Venice. According to the banker, you have failed the job and reduce your fame, but the gold will remain in the bank.

- Easy experience -
Locate the weak pirate in Tunis and bombard him when he leaves. Challenge him to a duel and weaken him to 50 hit points. After the duel ends, challenge him again to another duel to gain more experience. Repeat this as needed.

- New ship types -
Place $50,000 a month for five months in the Bristol shipyard to gain additional ship types, including a barge. Place $50,000 a month for five months in the Hamburg or Antwerp shipyards to eventually get the full-rig ship.

- Better ships -
You can find better ships to fight with in Sakai and Nagasaki. The easiest way to get there as soon as possible is to trade carpets and arts until you have around 10,000 gold pieces. Then, buy glass beads in Venice and sell them at the port of Madeira. The beads will cost 2 or 3 gold and can be sold them for about 50 gold. In Madeira, buy sugar for 12 gold and sell it at the port of Santa Cruz (1 day of sailing south of Madeira). Buy flax from Santa Cruz and sell it in Amsterdam. From there you can buy glass beads and repeat the process. Do this until you get to 20 gold ingots. Then get some balm in Barcelona and cruise to the far east with a small ship (preferably with rows like a LaReale) with high velocity (such as a Caravella Redonda). First, stop in Nagasaki and invest 50,000 gold at the shipyard. You should do this when you reach the end of a month, as it is faster that way. When the month changes, you should find an Atakkabunde (cheap and efficient). Buy it and remodel it to only support 30 crew members and no cannons. If you have mates that can pilot ships, then buy a couple to speed up things. In Nagasaki, buy silver and sell it in Changan, Zeiton and Sakai. These ports have silk items; buy some to sell in Nagasaki. If there is no silver, buy porcelain. You will get fair price for porcelain in India -- the clove and pepper are cheap in India and sell for ten times higher in the Far East. Five months in a row, invest 50,000 in Sakai or Nagasaki. When they reach 1000 points in the shipyard, you will find a new boat: Tekousen. This is the ultimate battle ship. It is row powered, which is good when the wind dies, and can reach up to 20 knots in speed. Remodelling the Tekousen only permits you to hold 300 crewmen and up to 100 cannons. Another trick: buy a used Tekousen. It will hold 360 crewmen and 80 cannons. It is easier to maneuver in battle, and it has more speed than a Venitian Galeas. It also has as much cargo capacity as a full-rigged ship or even a barge.

- Errol's Plate armor -
Go to the Black Market in Copenhagen to get Errol's Plate. That is the star class armor, which is even better the Pull Mail Armor.
Information in this section was contributed by John Bowman.

- Crusader's Armor -
Go to Naples at 2:00 a.m. and purchase the Crusaders Armor. It is also star class armor, but it is a lot better then the Errol's Plate, which is cheaper.
Information in this section was contributed by John Bowman.

- Carronades -
Head towards Bristol and invest in both Shipyards and Trade Market. Keep them both invested with the same amount of money, $50,000. After you have gotten the Barge ship, invest once more in the Shipyard and Trade Market. Return next month and remodel your ship's guns. The message "Your in luck, we have a new specialty today" or something similar should appear. If this does not happen, leave the Shipyard menu and keep returning to remodel guns. The new gun is Carronades. Its attack power is as strong as a Cannon, and its range is as far as a Culverin. This is the most powerful guns in the game.
Information in this section was contributed by Peter Xiong.

- Merchant discounts -
The Merchant will always discount the price of his goods at the rate of 75.0% of the full price. For example: If you were buying Porcelain for 108, do not pay more than 81. You will be able to get this discount even if you do not have a good bookkeeper. The key to getting this discount is to make sure the port is allied with your country (and also not a neutral port). You do not have to have a Tax-Free Permit, but it will reduce your price even more. Also, if you have a bookkeeper, they will do all the work for you. This is a rather short list of the bookkeepers: Esteban Ortega, Jacob Walweik, Antoine Fitch, Benito Gomez, and Tristan Seillo.
Information in this section was contributed by Ben Campbell.

- Shipbuilder discounts -
Any Shipbuilder will always give a you discount of 83.6% of the full price. For example, if a ship costs 10,000 to build, you should not pay more than 8,360. He will accept the price.

    <desc>Climb aboard your flagship and set sail! As a young Portuguese captain, you are in search of fortune and fame. With your first mate at the helm, navigate the way to distant lands and legendary riches. Port ho! Cast anchor in a new land and barter with stubborn merchants for exotic spices and gems. Use profits to improve your fleet or face the dangers of the sea-pirates, storms and the mysteries of the deep. Win allies for Portugal, and the King will reward you grandly!

Gameplay:

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.

Hints:

- Initial Stat Increase -
Say No when starting a new game to the stats offered roughly 75 times. After doing so, you'll notice the offered stats have increased exponentially.

Undead Line is a top-down arcade shooter with scrolling screens, like Commando and other games. The player controls a character (from a selection of three on the MSX 2 version) that shoots projectiles at enemy monsters.

The six levels available are presented in a menu and can be selected and played in any order. There is a boss battle at the end of each one.

Chests with power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. They open when shot, and in the Genesis version it is possible to cycle through the available power-ups by keeping firing at them. The power-ups include armor and speed boosts, and several types of projectiles.

Translation Description:

This is a translation patch for the Mega Drive game called "Undeadline". It sports a variable-width font engine with kerning and, as usual, it is a "dual-language" patch, meaning that it supports both Japanese and English, depending on the country code of your machine. There are also two fonts to choose from.

    <desc>Join broadcaster Al Michaels for the one of the roughest, toughest football games ever played. With all of the NFL teams and more than 1,400 licensed players, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS has all of the excitement of Pro Football including blind-side sacks, goal line leaps, and some of the most brutal tackles outside of professional wrestling. With two dynamic camera angles, the game takes on the feel of a television event, and digitized player cards provide a cool way to look at stats. As the name would indicate, there's a High-Impact option that pushes the action to the extreme, so get ready to hear some bones crunching when Junior Seau gets fired up. Save all of your game progress with complete battery backup.

Gameplay:

UR95 is your average football game featuring both single plays against the computer or a friend, and full-fledged seasons, including playoffs and Super Bowls.

The main attraction to the game however is a "Construction Set" option which allows you to create everything for your own team, to your playbook and tournaments. You can even do your own team's logo and import/export your creations to trade with your friends.

    <desc>Urban Strike: The Sequel to Jungle Strike (Urban Strike for short) is a shoot-'em-up game developed by Electronic Arts, Granite Bay Software, and Foley Hi-Tech and initially released in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in the US and Europe before being ported to a variety of other consoles, including to the Sega Game Gear (released 1995). It is the third game in the Strike series, following Jungle Strike.

In the year 2001 a candidate for public office, H.R. Malone, is found out as a criminal (despite having political messages promising eliminating crime) by the US Special Forces team of the previous games. This leads to a call to an associate to investigate and stop the Special Forces team from interfering with the setup of a superweapon. Seemingly unbeknownst to Malone, that associate is actually a Special Forces infiltrator leaking the information... but the limo he is to leave in explodes, and the rest of the team is called in to stop Malone with stop the leaking of what little information they have.</desc>

    <desc>Valis III is a 1990 action game for the TurboGrafx-16 CD by Telenet Japan. It was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 and released in the US and Japan. It was the first Valis game released on a Sega system (the first two games would follow).

After the events of Valis II, the Dark world is being destroyed. The fortuneteller Leigh informs the Dark world's king, Glames, that they only have six months before it is destroyed. Hopeless, Glames decides to become king of both the Human world and Dreamland, but knows that Nizetti is controlling the power level of the Valis sword and that any attempt to invade either world would result in Yuko coming with a full-powered Valis to destroy him. Nevertheless, he takes the risk, knowing his sword Leethus, is just as powerful as Valis and when they are combined.

Of course, Yuko doesn't know any of this this. But Cham, another warrior, does.</desc>

    <desc>Valis: The Fantasm Soldier, called Mugen Senshi Valis in Japan, is a 1986 platformer by RIOT, a studio at Telenet Japan, for the MSX computer. It was ported to the Sega Mega Drive and released in late 1991. Despite being the first game in the Valis series, the Mega Drive port was released after the port of Valis III was!

Yuko is walking when the weather repeatedly changes from raining to dry. Yuko notes that she dreamed about it the night before, and in that dream, she heard a voice call her. Suddenly, her friend Reiko appears, speaking in a very unusual fashion before leaving "for a while." While Yuko wonders why Reiko was acting weird, a monster appears out of nowhere and attacks. The voice from Yuko's dream calls out again, this time coming from someone in real life, and that person throws Yuko the Valis sword, allowing Yuko to attack not only this monster but all the monsters coming in.

That person turns out to be Varia/Valia, a being from fantasy world (whose name has changed in later translations). fantasy world exists in another dimension, but is bound to the dimension Earth is in ("the real world") by the internal "Yin"/"Yang" (always referred to with quotes) balance of people's souls - which has come out of balance because of Yin's power "Vecanta," which has caused "people" to "entertain" themselves with war. Rogles, a king of another dimension, is behind this manipulation. To ensure his victory, Rogles took "Yang"'s power, put it in the Phantasm Jewel, and broke it into pieces, scattering them across dimensions and guarding them with his best guards. Yuko most now collect the pieces and use "Yang"'s power to defeat Rogles.</desc>

    <desc>Vapor Trail: Hyper Offence Formation, called Kuuga: Operation Code "Vapor Trail" in Japan, is a 1989 shoot-'em-up by Data East, originally released internationally in arcades before being ported to the Sega Mega Drive by Telenet Japan studio RIOT in 1991; this release would only come out in the US and Japan. Two sequels were released - Wolf Fang: Kuuga 2001 (1991, ported to Saturn 1997) and Skull Fang: Kuuga Gaiden (1996, ported to Saturn 1997).

Unidentified forces have taken over New York City, and a network of airborne military fleet is manned to reclaim the city. You play as one of three ships in the network: Sliph, a medium-speed attacker/fighter, Valkyrie, a low-speed attacker, and Seylen, a high-speed fighter. A second player can man a second ship for two-player combat.</desc>

    <desc>Vectorman 2 is the sequel to Vectorman, released in 1996 for the Sega Mega Drive. Though it claims to be a direct sequel to the original game, Vectorman 2 takes place mostly in the present day, rather than an urban futuristic setting seen in Vectorman. As one of the last titles to be released for the system, Vectorman 2 did not see a formal release outside of North America on the Mega Drive, but was released in Japan as part of Sega Archives from USA Vol. 3. Gameplay is identical to its predecessor.

Vectorman 2 has re-appeared in a number of compilations, including Sega Mega Drive Collection, Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection and even Sonic Gems Collection.</desc>

    <desc>Vectorman is a platform game developed by BlueSky Software and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It was released on October 24, 1995 in North America and on November 30, 1995 in Europe.

Vectorman was made partly in response to Nintendo/Rare's Donkey Kong Country, which contained pioneering graphics with pre-rendered 3D models as sprites. Donkey Kong Country's marketing stated that the game was impossible to do on Sega's Mega Drive, and Vectorman acts as one attempt to prove Nintendo wrong.

The game was first released in Japan on the PC compilation Sega Archives From USA Vol.1. The game is also a part of the Sega Mega Drive Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable and is part of the Sonic Gems Collection for the Nintendo GameCube. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console on February 27, 2007 in Japan and April 5, 2007 in Europe, and in North America on September 22, 2008. Vectorman is part of Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection as well.</desc>

    <desc>Humanity has long since advanced into space, and colonies have been established on many planets, but humanity has yet to contact any alien life. However, an emergency signal has come from the planet Shirakusa. During a colonization survey, contact was lost with the battleship Aphrodite. As a member of the elite Verytex squad, you are sent to investigate.

Verytex is a vertically scrolling space shooter with vague organic themes. There are six stages and three different weapon types: Normal Shot, a standard multidirectional cannon; Beam Laser, a powerful forward-shooting weapon; and Boomerang Laser, a wide-range forward shot. Each weapon type can be upgraded to three increasing levels of power. Also available are homing missiles, which are also upgradeable, as well as smart bombs and shield pickups.

Gameplay:

Verytex was a very straight-forward Shoot em' Up: it had an easy to learn weapon system with three weapons and three power-up levels for each, shield pick-up icons and the option to shift the ship's speed to three levels. Players had to fight seemingly robotic enemies through six long levels and face a boss at the end of each one with the occasional mini-boss between. Verytex was one of many Shoot em' Ups with a checkpoint system involved; it is often criticized for having long, almost 2 minute stretches in levels, fighting the same waves of enemies again with little difference in attack patterns. Often these sections are longer than the rest of the level. They lead up into the boss, and when you lose a life against the boss, you must restart the 2 minute section over again. Verytex also had a limited number of lives for the player to use and a Continue option was available only on the Main Menu.

Hints:

Extra Lives - Pause the game, then while holding down press start for each extra life you want.

Extra Shields - Pause the game, then hold right and press start for each extra shield you want.

Pause Game - Hold A + B + C + Start

    <desc>Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter, released in 1992 by SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade platform. By default, 1P and 2P can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled.

Directions:

Move your space craft around, trying to dodge enemy attacks and not to clash with other moving objects. Shoot your lasers in defense and try destroying anything you see. Grab power-ups for a boost and use special weapons on enemies that are a bit tougher!

Gameplay:

Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.

One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.

Controls:  

A Button: Special Gun
B Button: Shoot
C Button: Special Gun
Start Button: Pause

    <desc>One year after after the first tournament Akira, Wolf, Pai, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Sarah and defending champion Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.

Gameplay:

Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.

While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps to bring the arcade experience home.

Trivia:

 - This was the first Sega Mega Drive game to be released in Japan on Virtual Console for Nintendo Wii.

 - The Sega Genesis port doesn't feature Shun Di and Lion Rafale, the two new characters introduced in the arcade version of Virtua Fighter 2.

Hints:

- Different Costumes -
To play in a character's different costumes, Hold UP and then select your character with the A button or C button. or Hold DOWN and select your character with the A button or C button or Start button.

- Extra Character Selection Time -
Press Down, Up, Right, and A + Left at the Character Selection Screen for 99 seconds of time.

- Hidden options -
Enter the options screen,then highlight the ''Exit'' selection, and tap Left until the hidden options are displayed

- No Damage -
Hold B while highlighting player 1's life selection at the Options screen, until the message ''No Damage'' appears. Then press Start.

- Play as Dural -
Just highlight Akira if using controller one or Jacky if using controller two. Then press Left and then Right on the D-Pad. Repeat this a few times and Dural should then appear as a selectable character. Now you can use him as your character in the game!

    <desc>Virtual Pinball is the spiritual successor to Bill Budge's classic Pinball Construction Set. Programmed by Bill Budge, this Sega Genesis game allows the player to try different pre-built pinball tables and additionally create, save and play custom tables.

Directions:

First, there are a bunch of options to choose before you start the game. Choose what board you want. There are also a lot of secret boards you can access with cheat codes in the "enter code" section of play mode.

Then choose which background you want to play on. You may also change what the flippers, bumpers, and obstacles theme is.

After you do this, you may choose the music and one or two players. In two player mode, you just take turns playing one ball.

The A button will pull back the plunger. B is used to shake the machine. Shake all you want, because it is impossible to tilt it. The only complaint in the gameplay is the fact that in multiball mode you can't see both balls. The board is so big you can't see the whole thing at once, so the camera will follow your first ball, and you'll lose track of the extra one. 

Gameplay:

A player will start with 4 balls. Once a game is started a ball is placed in the launcher. The ball is launched by pressing and holding the A button, with the time held determing the power of the launch. All left flippers are controlled by the D-pad, while all right flippers are controlled by the C button. Hitting B will nudge the table, and can be used in conjunction with the D-pad to nudge in a certain direction.

Controls:  

A Button: Pull Plunger
B Button: Shake Machine
C Button: Right Flipper
D-pad: Left Flipper
Start Button: Start, Pause

Hints:  

- No Tilt - 
You can't tilt the machine, so be sure to shake all you want to keep the ball from going down the "drain."

Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega's first ever 3D polygon-based racing game from the arcade. The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate or expert track competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls feel very "arcadey" and you can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.

The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is particularly interesting as it is the only game for the system which features the "SVP" or "Sega Virtua Processor". This is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES's SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX. However at the time the cost was tremendous meaning that this game cost around 1.5 times as much as a regular game. It did not sell well making this game quite a rare collector's item. Also of note - AFAIK the SVP chip has not been emulated to date hence you will need a real console and cart to play this game!

    <desc>Grimlord has sent an arcade game to Tao's Dojo which ends up sucking Ryan Steele, J.B. Reese, and Kaitlin Star into Virtual Reality. For them to get out, they have to get by Grimlord's Skugs and monsters.

Trivia:

- If one were to play as a Trooper against the Clone-Bot in the form of that trooper, the Clone-Bot's Trooper form will appear in a different color.

- The video game contains a creature named Kamelion, as the final boss of the game who can shapeshift into any other playable character in the game and utilize their abilities. This creature does not appear in the series, yet is somewhat similar to the Season 1 robot general, Zelton.

Dastardly and Muttley are set on winning (or sabotaging) the annual Wacky Races. A racer bearing a strong resemblance to mario kart with the Wacky Racers from the Hanna Barbara cartoon.

Might have made a pretty good competitor for Mario Kart if the game had been completed. The known beta lacks the polish of a finished product, but is playable and looks decent enough, the worst bit is the poor sound.

    <desc>Wani Wani World is a modified conversion of the 1991 Kaneko coin-op The Berlin Wall, itself based on the 1980 coin-op Space Panic. Two small dinosaurs with very large hammers, Charlie and Smiley, make their way through numerous screens of platforms and ladders filled with enemies. Their only method of attack is to bash a hole in the ground, wait for an enemy to fall into it, and then bash the enemy in the head, which causes the enemy to fall and transform into items and delicious food.

There are five worlds, each with several screens and large boss at the end, as well as a minigame between worlds where bonus items can be earned. The game can be played alone or two-player cooperatively.

    <desc>When the sun aligns with the moon once every millennium, druid guardians summon their magic of their runestones to prevent the rebirth of the Warlock. The runestones are scattered through time and across the continents and you must find them before the Warlock does.

Gameplay:

The gameplay is simple. You go through different stages fighting of creatures and then finding the runestones. You fight off enemies by simply blasting them with this energy, using this orb you have with you, or you can use a spell to kill them. There are some puzzles in the game too. Some of the battles with the tougher enemies require some strategy to defeat them.

    <desc>The premise of Warpspeed is to rid the current scenario of enemy fighters. Scenarios make use of quadrants in which the player flies sector by sector or uses faster-than-light travel to warp from sector to sector. Most space flight consists of navigating asteroid fields, although some sectors contain mines that must be destroyed. During the course of gameplay, the player receives transmissions regarding various topics, consisting of clearing out minefields to travelling to a specific sector to obtain some manner of space technology before the enemy reaches it. Other transmissions are distress signals from space stations asking for assistance from approaching enemy fighters.

Warpspeed features gameplay that takes simulates all directions of movement, allowing the player to supposedly travel in 360 degrees in flight; however, the quadrant is laid out in a 2-D configuration so that the player only really travels along an X-axis and a Y-axis. Wormholes are also located in various quadrants and allow transport to other quadrants; however, they slowly deplete the vessel's warp drive reserves.

The game allows four different space craft for the player to use, each with progressively stronger weapons. The players accumulated game score eventually allows the player to automatically upgrade to the next available craft. The game also features an award system based on the number of points you have gained from destroying enemy fighters to achieving other goals.

The game also features a damage system that affects the performance of your craft. For instance, if the damage control screen indicates your engines have been damaged, your maximum speed will decrease; if your weapons system has taken damage, your weapons will not always fire correctly, etc.

Throughout the quadrant there may be one or multiple space stations for the player to dock with, refuel and replenish their ship's systems, ammunition, and warp drive reserves. These stations are critical to the player and if they are lost, they can not be replaced.

If the players craft suffers too much damage, the vessel will be destroyed. The player has three lives to complete the chosen scenario. If the player loses all three lives, the game is over.

    <desc>Warrior of Rome 2 is a real time war simulation strategy game.

Released in '93 till date there is nothing comparable to what it has achieved. Set in the backdrop of the Roman Empire's heyday it tells the story of Caesar and his famous battles.

The game plays like hardly any other game ever made making it strikingly unique. Two armies face each other on a set map and are allowed to construct there own formation of useful buildings while at the same time fighting each other off and growing in skill level. As units gain experience from battles they improve their combat function, speed of movement, building skills, sailing skills, depending of course on what they have been experiencing. If a unit gets killed all of its experience gets lost along with it so the skill balance then tips in favor of the opposing army. If this happens too much a very balanced war then turns into a rout with the quickness. Controlling each unit is done with a host of specific commands allowing you to have pin point control over the movements of your units. You can have your units attack any structure from a peasant's house to the enemies main fortress or move to any point on the map you choose.

Having total control over the movements allows you to micro manage all aspects of your war strategy keeping in mind the bigger picture of what is going on on the map in general. This game plays like nothing else out there.

The story is that of Caesar which has been told many times by Shakespeare in his semi historical play. The only difference here is the ending and the fact that you follow Caesar step by step until he reaches Rome. The ending is a shocker for those of you familiar with the story of Caesar and I won't give it away here because that would be a spoiler of sorts. The symphonic soundtrack feels as though it was written especially for the many moments of suspension and tension through out the game as the story unfolds setting the mood perfectly.

Graphically this game performs on a very high level. The units develop different animations based on there skill levels. If the unit is specialized in speed it gets a horse. If it really is good at speed it gets a imperial white horse. If the unit is specialized in combat it gets a shield and sword but if it is better at aerial attacks it walks around with a bow and arrow. One of the most impressive animations are the volley animations when arrows or napalm are flying around they are executed with a fluidity that is impressive.

As for sound and music this game had some sort of master working on it.

Even though the music loops every 90 seconds it never gets old and it is composed to fit the atmosphere of the game, sort of old school music and it sets the mood perfectly for what goes on as the game develops.

The re-playability of this game is astounding. Mostly due to the 2 player mode that has 44 maps to select from, each one demonstrating a unique complexion of geography that makes you think and evaluate strategy on different levels. The 2 player mode is where this game really shines because the a.i. of this game is the only weak link. complex strategies that develop as you understand how this game functions are never executed by the a.i. but going up against a human player there is no limit to the combinations of strategies that will get played out against each side, creating some of the most outrageous scenarios you could imagine.

My final recommendation is that it takes time to learn how to play this game because of the depth and the unique control scheme that most video game players will find themselves unfamiliar with but once you have figured out how this game works you will realize that this is definitely a masterpiece.

(On a side note Warrior Of Rome 3 was released on the Super Nintendo in Japan and uses the same game engine as 2 except it is upgraded a little bit and has a new story. This is probably the most rare game for that system only 500 of them were printed due to financial constraints of the publisher. Considering how good 2 is 3 is probably real good if someone could find it that would be cool. As for now no one knows where a copy is.)

Hints:

- Tug of war mode -
To access a secret tug of war mode, start a new game, and press start. Go to Load Data, and put the cursor on the right edge of the box. Hold start on the second controller, and press A on controller one. Then press start on controller one. To play, repeatedly tap the C button.

    <desc>Another victim of localization was Langrisser, at least graphically. When it became Warsong, Treco redid a few of the character portraits. Not really a big deal, and some might even prefer the changes, but this patch will revert the graphics anyway.

This patch is more interesting when combined with D's text hack, which fixes the names to better match Langrisser. Make sure you apply this graphics patch last.

    <desc>The Dalsis Empire has laid seige upon the Castle of Baltia to seize the legendary sword WARSONG. In a desperate attempt, King Alfador sends his only son, Prince Garett, into the countryside, away from impending death. Now Garett must rally his allies from across the kingdom, and lead their valiant armies in a battle against the Empire to retrieve the sacred sword! But, time is running short! Command troops and choose your mission commanders. Unite with loyal allies and charge into campaigns that forge the destiny of a realm. Between you and the path to victory lie dangerous rogues, the steel of Dalsis, and a confrontation in the ultimate showdown against evil!

Gameplay:

The player controls a group of heroes or commanders to accomplish some goals each phase. They are joined with non-controlled allies to battle with enemies commanders. Before each phase, the player can purchase up to eight army units from a single type for every one of its heroes. The type of the available army depends on the hero class (e.g Griffons can only be purchased by Dragon Knights) and have different prices. At the end of each phase, any survivor army provides some amount of cash for the player to use next time.

After each battle, the winning commander gains experience that allows him to upgrade to a more powerful class. If a hero dies, he is lost forever.

Hints:

- All Items -
When recruiting soldiers or equipping items Hold Up-Left + A + B and Garett must be highlighted as well. All items will be available except for warsong.

Note: You lose all of your cash by doing this.

- Scenerio Select -

-Zoom the map out
-Move the cursor to the top left corner

NOTE: If you warp to a scenerio where a character first appeared, you may lose all expirence for that character.

- Sound Test -
-Zoom the map in
-Move the cursor to the top left corner
-Move the cursor down one space and to the right one space

    <desc>Some time in the future, a shift of the earth's polar axis has resulted in a world of endless water where those who managed to survive reverted to a primitive form of life. What is left is the search for dry land. Floating cities, called Atolls, serve as a place of habitat for a simple and moral type of people who work to protect precious water, soil, seed, and other highly valuable resources that are essential for their existence. More mobile and larger in numbers than the Atollers are a gang of pillaging Smokers, led by the evil Deacon (aka Dennis Hopper). Their efforts are focused entirely on attaining and controlling anything and everything to build their evil empire. In half wrecked Atolls, the last remaining Atollers are waiting to be rescued.

As the Mariner (aka Kevin Cosner), your mission is to prevent Smokers from enslaving them. The Smokers most prized target is a little girl named Enola, who has a map to dry land tattooed on her back. In the game, Enola is the floating Atoller that flashes. If you are able to prevent Enola from being captured, at the end of the round the bonus multiplier will increase.

There's no intro, but the startup screen comes along with an exciting 5 minutes long intro tune. Sadly the in game music consists out of just one single additional theme which will accompany you throughout ALL the levels in the game. The sound effects also leave something to be desired, all you hear is a beep, a boom (that's the explosions when you kill a Smoker) and a blab.

But before I go on, I think everyone should have at least seen the motion picture movie of Waterworld first. I just remembered that I recorded Waterworld on video a few years back when it was on TV, I have to go look it up... *searching* ... yep found it in the middle of a huge stack of videotapes. I think it's best that I go watch it now, because reading the storyline up there makes me want to view the action scenes and ending again ... I;ll be right back!

... Two and a half hours later ...

Wow, this movie might have flopped in the theaters because of the slim plot, but for such a long movie I think it has a lot of great action and fun scenes, I enjoyed it, so again: go rent it now. (editors note: Waterworld is only recommended if you are attempting to lull yourself into a coma). You see, each level starts with the Mariner arriving at an Atoll. Upon nearing the Atoll, the Mariner is ambushed by an army of Smokers whose primary focus is to capture the Atollers (and Enola of course) within the Atoll. A level is finished when the final enemy is destroyed, which happens to be at the end of each level. Bonus points are awarded for each Atoller saved. If you lose all of the Atollers prepare yourself for the PT onslaught, enemies that are extremely hard to beat, but must be destroyed to survive and pass to the next round.

If a Smoker picks up an Atoller, they will begin to flash, destroy his craft (mostly water-bikes) to make him drop the Atoller back into the water, so that the Atollers can continue their "oh help me I've fallen into the water please rescue me" routines again. When you play, you can move your Trimaran everywhere in 3D, but that's about it, the animations of the four enemies (Smokers, Beserkers, Thrashers, and Seekers), are very standard and don't look much like 3D. More dodgy, but you do get that Arcade shooter feeling when you're firing at all the bad guys. You get an extra life every 25,000 points, so be sure to save Enola as much as possible.

I didn't mention controls before, because they are dead easy, handy is to press down on the controller to get a bird's eye over view, then look where most Smokers come from, thrust over there in front of them, and when the first one is next you to turn the Trimaran in their direction and take them all out in a row as you drift on. The levels get harder and harder as you get further, but they just don't seem to become more fun to play with the same level and enemies over and over again.

This is one of those games that you play every once in a while when you just want to blast things. Barely medium quality game, at least they gave the multiplayer game a go by adding an 1-9 alternating players option to have your friends join in. Unfortunately they had to cancel the 2-player linkup mode, because Nintendo didn't release the linkup cable.

It's pretty funny to see "mild animated violence" on the box when all you see when the sharks eat an Atoller is a scull rising up as the shark disappears. I don't dislike this game like a lot of people do, it's a nice try at this genre, it's just too average. I had lots more fun watching the movie, which most consider a flop too.

    <desc>Though not revolutionary, this game is enjoyable, especially fighting. You can change your lines at will, show replays to taunt your friends you scored on, or even intimidate to start a fight! This game also has a season mode to run through to win the Stanley Cup. There seems to be no real NHL teams though, I didn't understand that, but it is interesting none the less!

Directions:

Just as in any typical hockey game in real life, get the hockey puck into your opponents' net for a goal. Team with most points after 3 periods is the winner. Watch out for penalties, and no fighting or you'll go to the penalty box!

Gameplay:

Players can play in exhibition mode, regular season mode, playoff mode, and even listen to stereotypical music of each nation in the sound test mode (country music for Canada, rock and roll music for Team USA, for example). In the Sega version, the player's names are formalized (Thomas instead of Tom, David instead of Dave, Steven instead of Steve, etc.).

Players can also have the CPU play some or all of their regular season, but the computer will lose more games than win them so it's important to play as many games as possible manually. In addition to NHL teams, the player can also play as international teams(Sweden, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Russia, United States and Canada).

"Wayne's World, Wayne's World! Party time! Excellent! Woo, woo, woo!"

It's Friday, it's 10:30 and like usual, Wayne and Garth are presenting their TV show. First they start off by reading a top-10 list of the worst games they recently played at the arcade. Then Wayne accounts on how he and Garth were suddenly sucked into a video game, and Garth was vkidnapped by the mysterious Zantar. "Weeuuu, weeuuu, weeuuu!" FLASHBACK, and now you're suddenly in control of Wayne as he must embark upon a quest to save his good pal Garth.

Gameplay:

Not to be confused with the DOS license, this Wayne's World is a platform- style game. You must jump, fight and rock your way through 4 different levels which include Kramer's Music Store, Stan Mikita's Donut Store, Gas Works and Surburbia. Using Wayne's guitar as your sonic weapon, it's most excellent noise will bring death to various enemies. Will you save Garth from the evil purple clutches of Zantar? SCHWING!

    <desc>In an age of conquerors, on a bloody battlefield... a wounded mercenary draws his last breath... and the spirit of a demon enters his body. He is reborn, rising from the dead to challenge the residing war king to a duel. With one blow a new empire is started...10 days and 20 dead rulers later the armies and lands are united by one man's hand. The reign of the DemonLord Zarak has begun.

At the height of the demon's power, the prophecy of his doom was foretold by a tribal shaman...

"When the night turns violent and the moon bleeds, gripped by the skeletal fingers of death...a child will rise to face the demon in combat...and the lord of demons will fall by the hand of...the WeaponLord."

Against the advice of his lieutenants to kill the children born that night, the DemonLord waits to face his foretold killer in fair, one on one combat. The DemonLord Zarak is a true warrior, even evil can have honor.

25 years later...

Sensing the prophecy is at hand, the DemonLord holds a great tournament of champion warriors. The winner will face the demon in a final battle. The Demonlord prepares to meet his destiny head on...and destroy the WeaponLord.

Gameplay:

At its core, WeaponLord is a standard 2D fighting game experience. Where it differs is in its gameplay mechanics, and in some of its aesthetic choices and presentation. Some of WeaponLord's more original features were:

    - Thrust-Blocking - An aggressive blocking system two years ahead of Street Fighter III's similar Parry System.

    - Multiple Endings - Characters would have completely different ending sequences depending if the player beat the Story or Arcade modes.

    - Weapon-To-Weapon - When two player's weapon's clash at the same time, a struggle ensues to see who can overpower the other.

    - Weapon Breaking - Character's weapons can be broken. This occurs when a Weapon-to-weapon struggle happens, and one player immediately Two-in-One's into a special move. This breaks off a portion of their opponent's weapon, greatly reducing their range and damage capabilities.

    - Deflect - Each character has one special move that acts as a Deflect. This is similar to a thrust block, as it collides with an enemy's strike, knocks it backward...but it then automatically hits the character while they're off-guard.

    - Take Downs - Certain special moves that also knock an opponent onto their back. A player can then follow up with additional attacks while their foe is still on the floor.

    - Hair/Clothing Trim - When certain attacks are performed on an opponent in mid-swing, you can cut off a piece of their clothing or their hair. An added humiliation.

    - Password System - A password is given at the end of a match, so the player can always return to the middle of a game, if need be. A secret password is also given so the DemonLord Zarak is playable in Story Mode.

    - Death Combos - Unlike Mortal Kombat or Primal Rage, Death Combos are a certain string of regular and special moves that each have a gory effect on their opponents. These combos take skill and timing to master, and can also be done in a few different sequences. Some effects include disembowellings, decapitations, head splittings which expose the brain, and body pulp; which tears away most of the flesh from the torso.

Hints:

- End Level Passwords -
Enter the passwords for each character below in order to reach their final battle on the hardest difficulty setting.

    <desc>A very basic translation of the popular game show Wheel Of Fortune, where you guess letters until you can guess the phrase. This CGA version has three old-school rounds of Wheel of Fortune (where the puzzles are simply "Phrase", "Title", "Person", etc.) and then a bonus round. You can compete against 2 computer players or up to three people can play against each other.

Directions:

Just like in the very popular game show, you spin the wheel with a certain amount of power and land on the money amount. Then guess a consonant and you get that money amount times the number of letters you guess in the word(s). Buy vowels to help you out and solve! Person with most money is victorious!

Controls:  

A Button: N/A
B Button: Select/Spin
C Button: N/A
Start Button: Start/Pause

    <desc>Worldwide Crime Wave!

ACME Detective Agency Hot On The Trail Of Master Thief Carmen Sandiego And Her Henchmen.

WANTED: Detective to locate and capture Carmen and her gang. Must be a hard working, independent, fun-seeking individual willing to travel the world. No experience necessary. 

Gameplay:

Carmen Sandiego is a game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found.

Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

    <desc>Carmen Sandiego and her gang are loose once again, and it is your job to capture her! This time round you not only have to find where she is, but also when she is. Traveling to various locations, you need to assemble clues by questioning witnesses and searching locations to close in and capture Carmen Sandiego. Included with the game is The New America Desk Encyclopedia to help make clues more meaningful (and act as a form of copy protection!).

    <desc>In the year 2222 AD, three exploratory spaceships departed our overpopulated solar system with the goal of finding new worlds to colonize. Five years later, the ships were listed as "Missing and presumed lost" with their last transmission: "We are approaching planet Voltegeus..." Less than a week after the incident, a massive alien vessel materialized in the vicinity of Mars and was heading towards Earth.

Gameplay:

Whip Rush is a side-scrolling (with certain vertically scrolling descents and ascents) shooter similar to Gaiares and R-Type.

You start with 3, 4 or 6 ships depending on the difficulty level you select.

In addition to moving and shooting, your ship has Power Claws that you can rotate and extend for offensive and defensive purposes. Power Claws can be equipped up to two units and can shoot bullets.

The upgradeable weapons are Laser, Missile, Fireball and Power Claw.

Laser is forward firing only but is rapid and strong, missiles can shoot back and forth and when shot from the Power Claw they will home in on enemies. Fireballs shoot in the opposite direction of your ships travel.

Unlike most other games, your ship has variable speed, which comes in handy when negotiating different kinds of obstacles and enemies.

    <desc>"Snakes! Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?"

The nest of deadly snakes has been disturbed by seismic experiments in a remote location. Now the snakes are slithering to the surface, causing confused terror in attacks on everything that crosses their path.

There is a way to control this madness, but it's not going to be easy. The snakes from this nest tend to eat snakes of the same color and design. If you can guide the slithering masses so that snakes of the same type meet and eliminate each other, then the world could be saved from this snake infestation.

It's all up to you! Guide the snakes, find matching pairs and keep the population under control!

    <desc>The oldest of the four Grand Slam tournaments, held in London on grass every July, is the basis for this tennis game. The ball comes off the grass surface fast and low, reflecting the surface's reputation for providing the most exciting tennis. It's viewed in the typical third person perspective, although with quite a distinct 3D effect and with shadows. You can play standard 1 or 2 player matches, or play the full tournament from the quarter-final stages onwards. You can play standard shots as well as lobs and drop shots, and full service rules are featured. You can select your character and build up their skills as the game progresses.

    <desc>Gynoug, called Wings of Wor in the US, is a shoot-'em-up developed by NCS in 1991 for the Sega Mega Drive. It was published by Masaya in Japan and Europe and DreamWorks in the US. You play as Wor, an angel who has to drive the evils of Iccus, who are attacking the heavens, back to their home and destroy them.

Gynoug uses a string of orbs to represent power level: collecting red and blue orbs will add one to a meter of the appropriate color in the HUD (and will consequently power up your weapons); losing a life takes one away from each.</desc>

    <desc>Winter Challenge is a video game that portrays seven winter sports that are competed in during the Winter Olympics. This game however was not endorsed by the International Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Committee, or any similar organization for any other country. It was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis.

Gameplay:

Most of the games consisted of using the directional pad for steering, and the A, B, and C buttons for performing certain functions like shooting, running, braking, or pushing off, as you would for the ski jump. Button mashing was necessary as times for a couple of the events, but most were focused on timing and accuracy. The ski jump was scored by distance, and the biathlon was scored by time and shooting accuracy. All the other events were scored by time.

    <desc>Wiz 'n' Liz are magicians. They live on the planet Pum and brew potions and cast spells. They also tend to wabbits. Lots of wabbits. One day, a concoction went awry and sent all the wabbits to distant parts of Pum. Wiz 'n' Liz set off to look for them.

Catch all the wabbits in tons of levels in several difficulty settings. Create magical words and mix ingredients for extra lives, bonus levels and other surprises. Features a password save system so you can take off where you left.

Gameplay:

The game takes place on a series of levels, each divided into eight worlds. Each world has a distinct graphical style and music, but the basic gameplay remains the same. Wiz and/or Liz must run through the landscape collecting the wabbits, against a strict time limit. To win, the player must collect floating letters which appear when a wabbit is collected, to spell out various words. Once collected, the player then must wescue all remaining wabbits on the level, collecting fruit, stars and clocks to increase the time limit. The limit starts at one minute and is only restarted when the player character dies. This time limit can however be extended by collecting a glowing orange orb which appears in the last ten seconds of a countdown and gives 30 seconds of bonus time.

Various kinds of fruit can be mixed in a cauldron, and depending on the fruit, the effect can be bonus points; a minigame; a weird graphical effect; a bit of silliness (such as declaring a "Game Over" and killing your character, only to put them back and sheepishly say "Only joking..."); turning the wabbits wed, bloo, or gween; or "Absolutely Nothing".

Like other Psygnosis games, Wiz'n'Liz features a number of cameo appearances from other Psygnosis characters, including Puggsy and Lemmings.

The Bonus game was featured in the original mid-90s run of competitive gaming television show Games World (broadcast on Sky One in the UK) as one of the challenges. Player took turns to play the Bonus game of collecting the bloo wabbits, and the highest scorer won that particular challenge. The game was not featured when the show was revived in 2000, largely because the Sega Mega Drive had become obsolete.

Hints:

- Bonus Round Cheat -
After completing the first round of any land with more than one round, wait for the words ''Push Start Button'' and ''Yeah!'' to appear. Hold A and C, and press Start. All the bonus letters will light up, letting you go to the bonus stage after you beat that land. Unfortuately, this trick doesn't work on every level.

- Cheat Passwords -
To fight against any of the screen-filling monster bosses in Wiz'n'Liz, enter the password TCDT GBBS. Other interesting passwords include BBBB BBBB, TTTT TTTT, CBSK LGQD and MQHS PKDN. The password MGTP GLLS will take you to the last round of the final level.

- Fight Any Monster Boss -

    <desc>Dr. Kal Morrow, expert in genetic research and creation of human-animal hybrids, has been kidnapped and his family brutally murdered by the terrorist organization CHIMERA. His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.

Gameplay:

Wolfchild was designed by Simon Phipps, also responsible for the earlier Switchblade 2, a rather similar game. The action is viewed from the side and scrolls in eight directions. The player must guide Saul through five levels, negotiating platforms and shooting various monsters, the result of Chimera experiments. Initially, the player character is Saul in his normal, human form. Only when enough energy has been collected does he turn into a wolf-human, giving him much better attack techniques.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>They're ferocious, beastly, wicked - you name it. That's right. The monsters from the far end of the universe have invaded. They've pillaged Xenobia and now they're headed for your town! Join Leo and Priscila and destroy them before it's too late to save the world!

Directions:

You play a green-haired boy hero (player 1) or a pink-haired girl hero (player 2) who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

Gameplay:

The game balances basic concepts found in both platformers and arcade shooters. The player is able to jump and shoot projectiles from a sword. S/he must ride a flying dragon and confront a large boss throughout the second half of each round. The player's life bar steadily diminishes as time passes. Health is gained through collection of fruit and projectile weapons. Some fruits, when shot, will expand and burst into multiple items.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only do these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages. If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game

    <desc>World Championship Soccer II is an update of the first game with improved graphics. It contains the teams from the previous game, but adds the 1994 World Cup teams to use in exhibition and tournament play. It also features eight teams from the 1986 and 1990 World Cups, more formations and strategy options, and a four-way play option so four people can play together.

It does not feature the FIFA logo or license and is more of a violent soccer game without yellow cards and penalties.

    <desc>This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to participate in the World Championship tournament. This is identical to the real 1990 World Cup.

Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.

Gameplay:

The game presents a top-down view of a simple version of soccer (there are no fouls, substitutions, or strategies). Players must dribble and pass the ball towards one end of the field and try to score a goal by forcing the ball into the opposing team's net. When the player's team has the ball, he or she can either dribble the ball across the field, kick the ball towards the goal, pass the ball in the air to another team member, or kick the ball forward in the direction that the player is currently facing. When the opposing team has the ball, the player can switch between different team members on the field, or slide kick their opponent to dislodge the ball from their control.

When the ball goes out of bounds, the game will switch to a full-screen graphical view for a corner kick or a goal kick. If the game ends in a tie and is not an elimination round match during the championship mode, the game will switch to a graphical penalty kick view.

To start a game, the player must first select which country they would like to be. Teams are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 being the best) based on four different attributes (Speed, Skill, Defense, and Keeper). The best team in the game is Brazil, while the worst two teams are the USA and Japan. Games run for 90 minutes, where each minute in the game is actually 6 seconds. There are three audio tracks during game play, chosen based on the teams in the match.

    <desc>Now you have the opportunity to play the same courses that have challenged the world's greatest golfers. World Class Leader Board features four of the toughest championship courses, each with 14 exciting competition formats. And because the look and feel are so life-like, if you haven't caught the golfing bug by now, you soon will! 

Gameplay:

Before the long-running Links series, Access produced the Leader Board lineage, which concludes here. Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as you dodge the bunkers, water and rough which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original.

A course editor is provided. The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.

The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.

    <desc>For the third World Cup in succession, US Gold had the license to produce the official game. They entrusted Tiertex with the task, who produced a top-down game recreating the full tournament. As well as the 24 teams who qualified for the tournament, other significant footballing nations like England, France and Denmark could be drafted in. The presentation of the menus is largely icon-based, with the official mascot featuring prominently. Tackling is difficult and passing is easy, making for a flowing end-to-end style of play.

    <desc>An alien entity known as Geegus threatens the Earth in the year 3091. As all of Earth's forces have been defeated, a scientist uses his recently-built time machine to find the greatest fighters of different eras to compete against Geegus.

Featuring a cast of characters ranging from ninjas to a cybernetic supersoldier, you'll fight your way through standard-fare one-on-one matches or take on an opponent in a Deathmatch, where spiked walls and landmines add to the danger.

Directions:

Punch, Kick, and Throw your opponent until they just can't take anymore, or their health bar runs out! Defeat enemy after enemy to become the world hero. In death matches watch for the ropes! Be sure to please the scientist who sent you on this trip!

Gameplay:

The game plays like many other fighting games, but instead of a 6-button layout, the original World Heroes uses only 3 of the standard 4 Neo-Geo buttons: one for punching, another for kicking, and the last for throwing. The former two buttons can be held down longer in order to deliver stronger attacks, similar to the first Street Fighter control scheme, with only two levels of strength and using standard buttons instead of pneumatic buttons. In the SNES version (and later games, starting with World Heroes 2 Jet), it is possible to assign the 4 basic attacks to different buttons. In World Heroes Perfect, each character had a traditional four-button attack layout, but could also achieve stronger attacks by pushing down two respective punch or kick buttons at the same time.

In World Heroes Perfect, every character has an ABC Special Move that can be activated by pressing the A, B, and C buttons at the same time. Moves vary by character, though they all require strategic use and are easy to activate, allowing for more tactical battles. For example, the character Fuuma's ABC Special allows him to fake a special move; J. Max's ABC Special allows him to catch, hold onto, and throw back projectiles; and Kim Dragon's ABC Special allows him to perform counters while blocking.

Aside from the normal tournament mode, there is also a popular Deathmatch mode (which was removed in World Heroes 2 Jet and World Heroes Perfect). In it, the arenas are filled with different kinds of traps that can change conditions in the bouts or even damage the characters (such as spikes, bombs, greasy or sticky floors, etc.). Deathmatch mode may have been inspired by the growing popularity of deathmatch style professional wrestling in Japan at the time, mostly made famous by Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.

    <desc>The most revered baseball game in Genesis history returns with more realistic action than ever before. Featuring updated rosters and stats (all current through the end of the 1995 season); WORLD SERIES BASEBALL '96 presents gives you access to the actual Major League schedule for the 1996 season. Choose from five different season lengths, or just brush up your skills in an Exhibition game. The game showcases all 28 current Major League teams and accurate stadium graphics, and more than 700 real MLB players are along for the ride. If you're looking for a quick fix, try the all-new Home Run Derby! Battery backup saves all progress, and you can play alone or against a friend.

Hints:

World Series Baseball '96 Easy Out - First walk the batter that is at the plate. then when the batter is walking to first base throw the ball to the first baseman and he will be called out if you do it before the runner reaches first 

Debug mode and Bluesky team - First you have to access the debug screen. To do this wait for the main title screen to start to fade and hit A+B+C+Start. I just hold A, B, and C until it starts tofade and hit start. Once you see the Bluesky screen hit Start twice. Set the options from top to bottom 3, 1, 3. Next, hold A+B+C+Start until the screen fades out and you get the Bluesky screen again. Hit Start twice. There will now be a Bluesky option. Set it to on, and pictures of the games programmers appear on the screen. Now just hit start to exit and you'll find the team in exhibition game mode. Too bad it doesn't let you use the team in season mode

    <desc>European Club Soccer brings the Big Match excitement of Europe's favorite sport to the Sega Genesis. Play over 170 teams from around the world and compete for the Super Cup, soccer's highest accolade and exclusive to European Club Soccer!

Directions:

As in any soccer match in real life you simply, while having the ball in possession, try to score a goal by getting the ball into your opponents net. While on defense try to steal the ball. The matches are long and of course best score wins!

Gameplay:

Gameplay is simple, and works only with two of the buttons of the gamepad - "B" is used to pass the ball low, and "C" to lob the ball. While a button to shoot is absent, if a button is held pressed, when released the ball goes at a much higher speed. The directional button can also be used to give after touch in lobbed balls and change direction or touching the ball backwards with the heel in low passes. Optionally, the "A" button can be used to swap to the nearest player, if the automatic option is disabled.

The game puts several tactics at the disposal of the player, while the computer has a predefined tactic for each team. Each tactic has its own advantage: the 4-3-3 tactic using a sweeper is the only one that allows a player to recover if the goalkeeper is beaten and 4-4-2 allows midfield control from the wings, for instance.

Controls:  

A Button: Change Formation
B Button: Pass/Slide
C Button: Shoot/Block Steal
Start Button: Pause

Hints:  

- Unlock All Star Team -
Press A, A, B, A, C, A, B, and A at the main menu

- Password For Final Round -

    <desc>Explore the sinister side of nature as you control a troop of armed-up, never-say-die Worms in an arcade-strategy extravaganza! Use Shotguns, Bazookas, Homing missiles and Banana Bombs in your bid for survival and the ultimate accolade... Victory!

Gameplay:

Worms is a turn based artillery game, similar to other early games in the genre such as Scorched Earth. The game is set on a two-dimensional field. The players control a team of worms, each consisting of four members. The objective is to kill every member of the opposing team(s) within a set time limit per round. Each turn, which lasts from 45 to 100 seconds, a player may move a selected worm and use one or more of the available weapons and tools.

The weapons include simple firearms like the shotgun and uzi, alongside a variety of heavy weapons such as the bazooka (the default selection), cluster grenades and airstrikes. The game also includes a number of 'secret' weapons (available through cheat codes on options screens or 'weapon drops' during the game) such as the Banana Bomb and exploding sheep, for which the series has become famous.

Also available are various tools such as the 'drill', 'blowtorch' and 'girders' - often used to add protection, adding additional strategy elements. The 'ninja rope', 'bungee' and 'teleport' are also available for greater movement across the playing field.

    <desc>Wrestle War is a port of the arcade game of the same name. You must take a rookie pro-wrestler, Bruce Blade, through a series of bouts to win the championship. There is no license. You wrestle in the "Sega Wrestling Alliance." However, many of the characters bear a strong resemblance to popular wrestlers or movie characters.

The ring is done in pseudo 3D. The graphics are sprites, but you can move along the Z and X axes and the ring will instantly rotate 90 degrees to give a better view of the action if you are blocked in. Your available moves are punch, kick, and grab. You must try to wear down your opponent's life bar, then pin them.

    <desc>WWF Raw is a professional wrestling game featuring 10 superstars from the World Wrestling Federation. The wrestlers you can choose from include Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Bam Bam Bigelow, 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, Doink, Lex Luger, Luna Vachon, Owen Hart, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, and Yokozuna.

In this game, you attempt to pin your opponent to the mat by reducing his power meter until he can fight no more. There is a large number of moves to perform, including turnbuckle maneuvers and "illegal" acts such as hitting your opponent with a metal folding chair.

This game supports up to 4 simultaneous players, and has the following game modes: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, Raw Endurance Match, and Rematch.

Gameplay:

In this game, you attempt to pin your opponent to the mat by reducing his power meter until he can fight no more. There is a large number of moves to perform, including turnbuckle maneuvers and "illegal" acts such as hitting your opponent with a metal folding chair.

This game supports up to 4 simultaneous players, and has the following game modes: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, Raw Endurance Match, and Rematch.

- Match types - 

In a One-on-One match, two wrestlers (one player versus the computer or two players) square off for a face-to-face bout. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament variations are available. One Fall matches feature an in-ring referee and are contested under standard rules. Victory is achieved by a 3-count pinfall or a count-out if a wrestler stays outside of the ring for a full 10 count. In a Brawl, however, the referee is absent. This allows unlimited time outside the ring and illegal moves such as eye raking and choking are allowed at all times. The Brawl match doesn't require a pinfall to win; instead, the first player to be entirely drained of their stamina submits in defeat. In a Tournament, a player must battle through the entire roster in a series of One Fall matches to win the championship belt.

A Tag Team match is made up of two teams of two wrestlers (if two players are involved, they can choose to either control opposite teams or be on the same team against the computer). Whenever one wrestler gets tired, they can tag in their partner. A wrestler on the apron can grab an opponent if they get close to the ropes, allowing their partner to attack them. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament configurations are available. In a standard tag team match, if an illegal wrestler is in the ring for a full 10-count, his/her team will be disqualified. Otherwise, the same rules for the singles One Fall and Brawl matches apply to tag team matches. In the tag team Tournament mode, either one player or two cooperative players will choose two wrestlers to form a team and then must defeat the remaining wrestlers in a series of One Fall tag team matches to win the tag team championship.

A Bedlam match is similar to a Tag Team match, except both team members are allowed in the ring at the same time (Essentially a "Tornado" Tag Team match). A team must defeat both members of the other team to win the match.

A Survivor Series match is also similar to a Tag Team match. Instead of only 2 members on each team, a team can consist of up to four wrestlers. It is also elimination style, in which a team is only victorious when all the opponents' teammates have been eliminated by pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification. Only one partner can appear on the apron at one time, but the player can change outside partners via a button command.

The Royal Rumble begins with two wrestlers, and more adversaries enter until six wrestlers are in the ring. Additional wrestlers enter as others are eliminated. There are no holds barred, and elimination occurs when a wrestler is thrown out of the ring. A wrestler must be worn down before they can be thrown out, unless they're caught running with a hip toss or back body drop. The last wrestler remaining in the ring after all twelve have entered wins the match. At the end of a Royal Rumble, score rankings are shown giving a wrestler's total time in the ring along with a list of opponents they eliminated.

A Raw Endurance match is a mix between a Survivor Series and a Bedlam. The player picks his first wrestler, then up to five more partners. The choosing of partners is optional, meaning a player can choose to go in with as much as a 6-on-1 handicap. The first team to eliminate all the members of the other team wins the match.

Hints:

- Continue in Rumble -
During Royal Rumble, if you are thrown out, hold A, B, &amp; C. If there are any wrestlers left, you will come back as that person. You should hear a single bell ring if done correctly.


- Full attributes -
Enter the CHANGE STATS code for the wrestler you want. When you are asked to change the attributes, hold Start until you hear a strange noise. You can now set all the attributes to 10!

 - Handicap match -
During a one-on-one match (one fall, brawl, tournament) press A+B+C on controller 2, and a wrestler will come out and help the opponent.

- Play as partner -
In a one player game choose a tag team match, a bedlam or a survivor series. Start the game, then press A+B+C to turn into your partner.

- Play as same character -
To play as a fighter that's already been chosen, move to that wrestler's selection screen. To activate your selection, press Up + A + C.
Note: this code works with 4-player adapters, but you can only have two of any one wrestler.

- Super punch mode -
This code will give you fists of steel. At the copyright screen, hold Start, then press Up, Up, Up, Up. The screen will flash red and you'll hear a crash.

- Three punch KO mode - 
At the copyright screen, hold A+B+C+START and rotate the d-pad clockwise. The screen should flash red if done correctly.

- KO the Referre -
To knockout the ref, either punch him three times or run into him. While he\'s unconcious you can perform illegal moves in the ring.
If you knock him out repeatedly, he\'ll run away and your match will become a brawl. This lasts until one of you runs out of energy.

    <desc>Control one of twelve World Wrestling Federation stars in a "no holds barred brawl" -- in other words, do whatever moves you want, from choke holds, piledrivers, and even chair slams, until your opponent is knocked out. You can even go outside the ring if you like. Several modes of play are available, including one-on-one, tag team (two-on-two), and three-on-three tag team. You can play as the following WWF wresters: Bret Hart, Razor Ramon, Randy Savage, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Tatanka, Mr. Perfect, Crush, Ric Flair, Yokozuna, Ted Dibiase, and Lex Luger.

Directions:

There are many game types:

In 1-on-1, you face an opponent alone.

In 2-on-2 tag match, you team with a person to take on two opponents.

In 3-on-3 tag match, it's like 2 on 2, but with 3 people on each team. Duh!

In Royal Rumble, you must fight 11 other guys in an "over-the-top-rope" elimination match. The name speaks for itself. Opponents are thrown out by use of the tie-up and tapping the A button while near the ropes.

Rules can be switched. There are 3 types of rules:

In One Fall, it's a normal match, with count-outs and DQs.

In Brawl, there is no ref, no count-out, and all types of moves are legal

In Tournament, you face an opponent to advance on to face others.


When Grappling, to do the following moves:

Send them to the ropes: Tap "A" a few times

Atomic Drop: Tap "A"+"B"

Gutbuster: Hold Down Press "A"+"B"

Bodyslam: Tap "B"

Head butt: Tap "C"

Suplex: Tap "B"+"C"

Hip toss: Tap "A", then when they approach you, Press "B"

Throw out of ring: Tap "A" near the ropes.

Choke: Tap "A"+"B" Near them.

Face Rake: Tap "A"+"B" At a distance.

When your opponent's bar is low and red, you can use your finisher! When in the right position, press A + B to execute it to give your opponent a beating! It helps a lot!

Gameplay:

- Match types - 

In a One-on-One match, two wrestlers (one player versus the computer or two players) square off for a face-to-face bout. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament variations are available. One Fall matches feature an in-ring referee and are contested under standard rules. Victory is achieved by a 3-count pinfall or a count-out if a wrestler stays outside of the ring for a full 10 count. In a Brawl, however, the referee is absent. This allows unlimited time outside the ring and illegal moves such as eye raking and choking are allowed at all times. The Brawl match doesn't require a pinfall to win; instead, the first player to be entirely drained of their stamina submits in defeat. In a Tournament, a player must battle through the entire roster in a series of One Fall matches to win the championship belt.

A Tag Team match is made up of two teams of two wrestlers (if two players are involved, they can choose to either control opposite teams or be on the same team against the computer). Whenever one wrestler gets tired, they can tag in their partner. A wrestler on the apron can grab an opponent if they get close to the ropes, allowing their partner to attack them. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament configurations are available. The same rules for the singles One Fall and Brawl matches apply to tag team matches. In the tag team Tournament mode, either one player or two cooperative players will choose two wrestlers to form a team and then must defeat the remaining wrestlers in a series of One Fall tag team matches to win the tag team championship.

A Triple Tag Team match is similar to a Tag Team match, except instead of two wrestlers to a team, there are three wrestlers on each team. Only one partner for each team appears on the apron at a time. The player can switch outside partners by pressing a button. One Fall and Brawl options are available (with one player or two players head-to-head), with the same rules as singles and tag team matches.

The Royal Rumble begins with two wrestlers, and more adversaries enter until six wrestlers are in the ring. Additional wrestlers enter as others are eliminated. There are no holds barred, and elimination occurs when a wrestler is thrown out of the ring. A wrestler must be worn down before they can be thrown out, unless they're caught running with a hip toss. The last wrestler remaining in the ring after all twelve have entered wins the match. At the end of a Royal Rumble, score rankings are shown giving a wrestler's total time in the ring along with a list of opponents they eliminated.

Controls:  

A Button: Run
B Button: Punch, dropkick while running, grapple while pressing C
C Button: Kick, Grapple while pressing B

Hints:

- Continue match -
Hold A+B+C after being thrown out. The sound of the bell will confirm correct code entry. You will return as one of the remaining wrestlers.

- Same character match -
Highlight any character, hold Start, and press B + Up. The corresponding wrestler may be selected as both characters in a match.

    <name>WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game</name>

    <marquee/>
    <desc>WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

Gameplay:

Despite being based on professional wrestling, WrestleMania's digitized graphics and fast-paced gameplay make it more of a fighting game in the vein of Midway's Mortal Kombat series. The game is regarded as over the top for its use of attacks. While some actual wrestling moves are present, matches consist primarily of insane combos and special attacks, such as the Undertaker casting spirits at an opponent and Doink shocking the opponent with a joy buzzer. There are other similarities to the Mortal Kombat games, such as the winner being the victor of two out of three rounds and players being awarded flawless victories, which are simply called "perfect" here.

WrestleMania's one-player mode has the player choose one of eight wrestlers (Bam Bam Bigelow, Bret "The Hitman" Hart, Doink the Clown, Lex Luger, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker or Yokozuna) and then go for either the Intercontinental Championship or the WWF Championship by fighting through several matches. In the Intercontinental Championship mode, the player must win four one-on-one matches, two two-on-one matches, and one three-on-one match to win the title. In the more difficult WWF Championship mode, the player must win four two-on-one matches, two three-on-one matches, and finally a "WrestleMania Challenge," where the player must defeat every wrestler in the game in a gauntlet, starting with a three-on-one setup, with each eliminated opponent being replaced with another until all eight have been defeated.

The game also features two multi-player modes; head to head, a one-on-one match between two players, or cooperative, where the two players team up in a tag team version of the WrestleMania Challenge in which they must defeat the game's eight wrestlers in groups of two to become the Tag Team Champions.

Commentary is provided by Vince McMahon and Jerry "the King" Lawler, who also appear in the game sitting at the announcer's table to the right of the ring.

The game was followed up by WWF In Your House for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC.

Hints:

- Unlimited combos -
Pause game play and press B, A, Down, B, Up, Left(x2). Both characters may execute unlimited combos.

    <desc>On the terrestrial planet Sephiroth, which is homez to a variety of peaceful and prosperous advanced societies, an ancient evil has returned. A long time ago, a warmonger known only as Guardia was banished from the planet, but has finally returned with an entire space military. The Guardia Military soon invades Sephiroth and crushes its defenses with its long hardened space technology. Within time, a space fighter was developed to match the power of the Guardia Military. Based on Guardia's unknown desire for destruction and it's own might, the ship was named the XDR: X-Dazedly Ray.

Gameplay:

XDR was incredibly straight-forward: players piloted the titular ship through six different levels blasting various ground and sky forces. Players could collect power ups such as different firing weapons, Options and items. Rather than having Bomb weapons, the ship was equipped to fire normal shots and missile pick-ups. Players could also change the ship's speed.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>A fast action shoot 'em up, Xenon 2 has gorgeous parallax graphics, music by Bomb The Bass (Megablast) and a wealth of visual imagination to add to the appeal. A classic from The Bitmap Brothers - big, slick and still one of the best looking (and sounding) games around.

Gameplay:

Xenon 2 Megablast is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. Unusually for the genre, the player's spaceship can reverse the scrolling of the play area for a limited distance, which is useful for escaping from dead ends. This game consists of five levels which are each divided into two sections.

The game has a generic sci-fi theme and almost no plot, focusing instead on presentation and gameplay. Indeed, it was the quality of the music and graphics that led to the game's memorability. The graphics bear the trademark "Bitmap Brothers" appearance, with realistic and detailed renditions of rock and metal objects. The enemies are various nondescript organic creatures.

The player of Xenon 2 Megablast must rely heavily on power-ups, which may be gained by shooting power-up containers that appear through the levels. When an enemy or a wave of enemies are destroyed they leave behind credits in the shape of bubbles. Small bubbles are worth 50 credits and large bubbles are worth 100. When a mid-level boss or end of level boss are destroyed, they explode to reveal lots of credit bubbles. Credits are then spent at a shop owned by Colin The Alien (who bears a remarkable resemblance to the alien from the film Predator). Power-ups of various sorts may be bought there. Accumulating power-ups rewards the player with more heavy-duty firepower. The shop appears mid-level and at the end of the level.

Hints:

- Invincibility -
Begin playing the game and get on the high score screen. Enter ARM as your initials. Play again and qualify for another high score that is lower than the previous attempt. Enter OUR as your initials. Then press the Reset button on the Genesis when demonstration mode begins. Begin a new game with invincibility enabled.

- Unlimited Lives -
Begin playing the game get on the high score screen. Enter OLD as your initials. Play again and qualify for another high score that is lower than the previous attempt. Enter AGE as your initials. Press Reset on the Genesis when demonstration mode begins. Begin a new game, and you'll have unlimited lives enabled.

    <desc>The X-Men engage in a battle so world-threatening, even Magneto switches sides! Mutantkind races to the edge of oblivion at the hands of an evil techno-bio cloning organism... the Phalanx! Be Wolverine, Cyclops, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Beast, Psylocke and for the first time ever... play as Magneto! X-Men are at their fiercest with Cyclops' optic blast, Wolverine's slashing adamantium claws and Gambit's hyper-charged cards! Use each mutant's super-powered attack to defend the world!

Gameplay:

The character lineup for the game includes Beast, Psylocke, Gambit, Cyclops, Wolverine, and Nightcrawler. Upon defeating the third level, Magneto becomes a playable character.

Each character has a "mutant power" which can be used in fighting. Some of these can be charged to a greater effect by holding down the power button, and all of them are increased in power when the character has nine or ten bars of health. In addition to these powers, some characters are capable of climbing the walls and ceiling, or grabbing onto the wall. These powers can be used to reach hidden health (which is in the shape of a double helix) or as a shortcut. Also, some characters had attacks that propelled them forward, enabling them to jump further. Finally, some characters had double jumps, useful for shortcuts. Also, Wolverine could heal up to three bars of health if he had only one or two bars remaining. This healing occurs automatically with time, so the player could simply wait until Wolverine healed before continuing.

Trivia

    - This game was innovative in that the player was immediately thrust into the game; the first level begins as soon as the game loads with a random character, leading some players to hit the Restart button on the console repeatedly until the desired character appeared. The first level comprised only one stage, allowing players to switch out characters after the opening stage. The title screen and credits roll only after completing the first level. In emulation outside the Genesis/Megadrive system, the character randomization appears to be non-functional, with the first level always beginning with Cyclops. FUSION emulates character randomization.

    - The game garnered considerable attention through the introduction of X-Man villain Magneto as a playable character.

    - Oddly enough, the European release of the game reused the same cover art of X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy for the Game Gear, a different and unrelated game.

    - Some levels featured different soundtrack elements depending on the character selected,with the basic structure of the level's musical theme remaining the same.

Hints:

- 99 Lives -
Press C + Down then press Up - Left - Up - Right - Right - C99 Lives

- Change Characters -
First do the Level Skip Code. Pause the game and press Left and C at the same time.Change Characters

- Invincibility -
Pause the game, press up+B. Then up, right, down, up, right, down, down, up, B. Unpause game; pause it again and press up+B

- Level Skip -
Pause the game,then simultaneously press Left,C.Next, press up,up,left,down,down,right,CLevel Skip

- Fight Phalanx-Magneto in the Last Level -
What you need to do is defeat all the Phalanx X-Men clones except for one. It doesn\'t matter what order you do it in just so long as all but one are dead. Now, once you\'ve done that, head back down to the very bottom of the area -- the end of the hallway where the Phalanx mech\'s claws turned into your character(s). Now, hit the wall to the left. If you do this, the wall should emit a circle of explosions which circle around twice and into a sort of close-eyed blank-looking smiley face.(Looks like this -&gt; -_-) Now, head back up into the second room from the bottom on the right. This room should have a wall blocking your progression. However, if you did as I said, if you hit this small wall, it should shatter like glass. Walk into the room, and there, you will fight Phalanx-Magneto!

Note: This does not effect the ending. It is just a nifty little bonus for those of you who like to explore.

    <desc>The evil mutant Magneto has devised the world's deadliest computer virus. Its sole purpose: To destroy the Uncanny X-Men. Now Wolverine, Gambit, Cyclops and Nightcrawler join Storm, Iceman, Archangel, Jean Grey and Rogue to stop Magneto from carrying out his diabolical plan. Their target is Magneto's secret base on Asteroid M. But lying in ambush are the murderous arch villains Juggernaut, Sabretooth, Mojo and Deathbird. Will Wolverine's adamantium claws and Gambit's energy-charged playing cards be enough to defeat the forces of Magneto? That's up to you.

Gameplay:

The game takes place in the Danger Room, a training area for the X-Men inside the X-Mansion. A virus transmitted via satellite has infected the Danger Room, disabling control and safety limits. The X-Men must endure the unpredictable behavior of the Danger Room until the virus can be located and eliminated. Once the virus is eliminated, the X-Men discover that Magneto is behind the computer virus and the final stage involves a battle with him.

Gambit, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Cyclops are available to play. Each character can jump and use various unlimited weapons (i.e. punch, kick) and a superpower which had a usefulness limited by a mutant power bar similar to a life meter, making the player rely more on standard attacks. The mutant power bar would slowly regenerate when depleted and when switching characters in mid-game, would revert to the status of the next characters mutant power bar from the last use.

- The four primary characters - 

Wolverine: As in other X-Men games, possessed a healing factor that enabled the character to recover from injury (i.e. replenish the life bar). When utilized properly, he can jump much higher than everyone else.

Wolverine's mutant ability was the use of his adamantium claws. Keeping the claws extended reduced Wolverine's mutant power bar. When the mutant power bar was depleted, Wolverine would go into a "Berserker" rage, slashing wildly and uncontrollably for a few seconds simultaneously depleting the life bar.

Gambit: Gambit made use of his trademark bo staff as a weapon in the game and also was one of the better jumpers.

Gambit's mutant ability was his kinetically charged cards but, unlike other games in which he has appeared, the cards would not launch straight across the screen but rather "track" the nearest enemy and destroy them, even through walls. Gambit's ability could be "charged" for additional effect.

Cyclops: Cyclops made use of his optic blast as his ability. As opposed to a screen long optic beam as one finds in other X-Men games, Cyclops's optic blast could be bounced off of walls to hit enemies from a safe location. His mutant power could be charged for an even more powerful blast. This character is also arguably the highest jumper of the game.

Nightcrawler: Nightcrawler's teleportation ability is made use of to the highest degree in this game. The character can actually teleport through walls and past obstacles, giving Nightcrawler the ability to bypass sections of a level the three other characters cannot. In addition, Nightcrawler could teleport the second player's character when the two stand together. He had arguably the worst jumping ability of the games characters, as he had the lowest ascending jump. This is an ironic twist since out of the four selectable characters, he would really be the best jumper by a large margin, and is typically a better jumper in other X-Men video games.

Other X-Men such as Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel can be called upon for support. Jean Grey also appears as support to pick up characters that fall. There are several levels, most having boss fights with familiar X-Men villains.

- Resetting the Computer - 

At the time, this game is one of few games which break the 4th wall. Once Mojo is defeated, the player must "reset the computer" for the Danger Room to stop the virus being emitted on Mojo's level. However, there are no switches for doing so. Resetting the computer is meant to be literal, in that the player has to lightly press the reset button on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console before the time ran out. This trick was widely panned by both video game magazine critics and consumers. Holding down the reset button too long would simply reset the system as one would normally expect. This also makes the game impossible to complete when playing on the Sega Nomad, as the portable Sega Mega Drive/Genesis has no reset button.

Hints:

- Extending the downtime in the Danger Room -
There is a machine in the upper right corner of the Danger Room. Destroying it will greatly extend the time in between stages.

- Full life -
Enable the ''Level select'' code.Select two-player mode.Hold Down+A+C. Remove the controller from port one and plug it into port two.Press Start.Select characters,a starting level,and begin game play.Press Start(2)for full life.

- Level Select -
Hold Down + A + C and then press (or switch) power on the Genesis. With those buttons held, hold Start when the ''Press Start'' text appears on the opening screen. Continue to hold the buttons until the difficulty selection screen appears.

Select any difficulty level and character, and walk to the right when the game play starts. Eight panels representing the eight game levels will appear on the wall. Crouch in front of a panel and press C to jump to the corresponding level.

Note: This code will not work if a controller is plugged into port two

    <desc>Terrorists have taken control of a top-secret undersea weapons facility! Unless the U.N. meets their demands, the terrorists will detonate a deep-sea thermonuclear device that will tear the earth apart. Facing global panic, the U.N. calls the X-PERTS, a 3-person ultra-secret counter-terrorist team. If the X-PERTS fail, the world pays! Play all three X-Perts at the same time and switch X-Perts during the game. Each X-Pert has unique attack weapons, technical skills, kill moves, and torture moves to extract information from human enemies. Use the X-Perts technical skills to hack computers and program robots. Real-world game play, where the game automatically saves the impact of your action and evolves as you play!

Gameplay:

Shadow leads a group of fellow X-perts in sabotage and other various missions. All three characters have character-specific special moves with differing attributes, along with three unique torture moves, which are used to interrogate various enemies.

Players are able to switch characters mid-game in order to carry out different tasks.

    <desc>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles is based on the television series of the same name, which is in turn based on the Lucas/Spielberg movie franchise starring Harrison Ford. In this game, a young Indiana Jones embarks on globetrotting adventures in which he gathers treasure and fights for what is good and right.

The game features side-scrolling action where young Indy trots along the ground, jumps, crawls flat, and can collect and wield a variety of weapons against copious enemies in the game. Indy starts with a whip and can find such weapons as throwing knives, grenades, pistols, rifles, and others. He can also collect hat powerups which allow him to sustain more damage.

    <marquee/>
    <desc>Years have passed since the swordsman Adol saved the kingdom of Ys from certain destruction. Joined by his companion, the ex-thief, Dogi, they set out for new adventures. And just in time...Bizarre tales of monsters and demons wreaking havoc throughout the Kenai Region reach our heroes. Dogi's hometown of Sarina is in the middle of the afflicted kingdom. He inspires Adol to help him rid the world of this new evil. Join them as they battle the forces of darkness - Deep in a haunted coal mine in the heart of an active volcano and on top of a blizzard swept peak. All the while uncovering clues to the identity of the malevolent force that is guiding the evil warriors of the Dark World.

Gameplay:

The gameplay of Ys III is a sharp departure from the previous two games. Instead of the previously used top-down camera view, Ys III has become a side-scrolling platform-action styled game. The combat has also changed: the player must push a button to make Adol swing his sword and attack enemies.

The RPG-style statistics and experience system still exists in Ys III, however. A new addition to this area is the "ring" system: Adol can acquire and equip rings that provide special effects while equipped. A new attribute, "Ring Power", is consumed while rings are active.

Hints:

- Restore Health -
Hold Up on controller two when the Sega logo is displayed. During game play, enter the status screen and hold C. Press Up, then Down.

- Level Up -
Reset the game while holding Up, A, B and C on controller 2.

Start the game with the buttons held down, wait until you can open your status screen. On the status screen, enter the code below

CodeEffect

On controller 2 holding C, press uppressing up raises your level

- Use the Amulet to max out your Levels, HP, and Gold -
When you are on the verge of raising a level, use the third and final charge of the Amulet on the monster that would've raised your level. The game will freeze for a second, the screen will flash, and your levels, HP, and gold should max out, along with the message that your Amulet is exhausted of it's powers. YOU MUST USE THE THIRD AND FINAL CHARGE of the Amulet for this trick to work!

This trick will not work in boss fights.

NOTE: This trick does not work on the SNES version of Y's III.

However, there was no place found for him either in paradise or in hell, and Koenma, the son of the death god Enma, sends him back to our world, where he has to be an "occult detective" and to fight against demons. Several characters join him on his quest: Kazuma Kuwabara, his ex-rival and best friend; Kurama, a 1400-year-old demon fox; and Hiei, formerly a demon who tried to conquer the world and had to repent for his sins by helping Yuusuke.

    <desc>Overview:

Using the mouse to determine the direction and strength of your putts, you must navigate 9 tricky holes of crazy / mini golf. Try to putt into holes protected by bouncing hamburgers, windmills, etc. Courses have several twists; one is a mad scientists's lab, another is a pinball table. The final hole is especially bizarre, themed around energy.

You start with 3 strokes, but get the par for each hole added on, if you reach it in time - run out of strokes, and your game is over. You can earn bonus strokes by finding hidden bonuses and by completing courses quickly. Up to 4 players at a time can take part in this game, with anyone badly over par being eliminated as the game progresses.

Gameplay:

Zany Golf is a version of mini golf with some features that are impossible in real, physical mini golf. Zany Golf only consists of half a golf course, i.e. 9 holes, although there is a bonus hole. The holes are as follows:

   1. Windmill Hole (Par 2): The ball has to be shot into a windmill, or slide down the ramp below, to enter the second area.

   2. Hamburger Hole (Par 3): The hole is covered by a bouncing hamburger, reached by bouncing the ball off a ketchup bottle that squirts.

   3. Walls (Par 2): Several walls continuously rise from the ground and fall back down. Depending on the timing, these can deflect the ball at different distances.

   4. Pinball (Par 3): The level begins as a game of pinball, where the player can hit the ball with the flippers after shooting it.

   5. Fans (Par 3): Fans positioned along the level allow blowing the ball in a different direction.

   6. Magic Carpet (Par 2): A special "magic" surface covering most of the level allows direct mouse control over the ball.

   7. Castle (Par 3): The ball has to be shot up a hill, to enter into a castle or holes outside it, to enter the second area.

   8. Ant Hill (Par 3): The hole itself moves.

   9. Energy (Par 5): Consists of various contraptions all over the place, with buttons that activate deadly laser beams, energy blasters, teleporters and suction tubes. Widely regarded as the most difficult hole by far.

  10. ???: This bonus hole is accessed by either completing the entire course under par (26), or by putting into a secret hole on the Energy level with exact timing. This level consists of a Breakout-style scenario, followed by a challenge where the ball must be putted across a checkerboard square, where alternate squares when rolled over teleport the ball back to the start.

    <desc>The space station Europe-1 has been overrun by aliens. During one of the fights the nuclear cooling system has been damaged, resulting in a meltdown within hours. Your mission, as a team of five of the toughest persons in the Corps, is to infiltrate and gain control of Europe-1. You must sweep the entire station clean of aliens.

Directions:

One of a few first-person-shooters on this console. It is required that you kill every single alien on each of the levels (hence the name). The five members of your team, who have different skills, start out with different weapons, are your five chances of seeing this through. This adds a level of strategy to the game.

Gameplay:

Zero Tolerance is made up of 40 levels spanning three separate areas: the space station Europe-1, the central command building for the Planet Defense Corps, and the sub-basement areas of that building. The object of the game is to kill all of the enemies on a level and then proceed to the exit, which is either a staircase or elevator leading down to the next level. However, nothing prevents the player from heading straight towards the exit without killing all of the enemies. If this is done, the player is simply not given any passwords until the entire area is finished.

- Weapons and Items -
Zero Tolerance contains a healthy selection of weapons. Each one is different and offers its own set of pros and cons. During gameplay, additional weapons can be picked up simply by walking over them as in other first-person shooters. To equip a weapon, the C button is pressed until the desired weapon is selected from the list of inventory items at the top of the HUD.

    - Hand to Hand Combat
    The most basic weapon of the game is your character's own punches and kicks. Selecting an empty item slot on the HUD and hitting the attack button causes the character to throw a punch. This can be modified by holding Up or Down on the D-pad, which will produce either an upper cut or a kick, respectively. Hand to hand combat is really meant to be a last alternative in the game.

    - Pistol
    The pistol offers you a basic projectile weapon. Ammo for it is plentiful, although it is weaker than other weapons.

    - Shotgun
    This weapon offers the advantage of increased power and easier aiming on the player's part. Like the pistol, ammo for the shotgun is easily found throughout the game.

    - Flame thrower
    Useful in creating a wall of fire that can stop a wave of enemies. There are a few drawbacks with the flame thrower, however. First, the ammo supply tends to be drained quickly, and flame throwers aren't as common in the game as other weaponry. On top of this, it is difficult to aim with this weapon.

    - Pulse Laser
    The pulse laser is a cross between a rifle and a laser gun. It fires invisible laser bolts in short bursts. The advantage of this weapon is that it is extremely effective against boss enemies. Unfortunately, it is not a common item in the game.

    - Grenades
    Much like their real-life counterparts, grenades are explosive devices which are thrown at enemies. They have a splash damage effect and are useful for clearing out smaller rooms.

    - Rocket launcher
    Fires an explosive missile. Like the grenades, these missiles also have a splash damage effect.

    - Laser Aimed Gun
    This is essentially an automatic pistol with a laser sight attached to it. It fires in short bursts rather than a single shot. Although it does not appear in the first area of the game, it is quite common in the second and third areas.

    - Mine
    This explosive weapon is difficult to find on the game but can prove very useful if being chased by multiple enemies. A mine can be left anywhere on the floor and will be detonated whenever an enemy walks over it. Like the granades and rocket launcher each mine has a certain amount of splash damage which is useful for clearing groups.

    - Medi-Pack
    This item restores the health of the player when damage is taken from enemies. It's effectiveness can be based on the particular skills of the character chosen by the player.

    - Bullet-Proof Vest
    Every so often a player may come across a bullet-proof vest. This item will shield the player from damage from enemies but only for 10 hits. It cannot be replenished by a medi-pack.

    - Bio-Scanner
    This item will allow players to see all the enemies on the radar without having to actually trigger their attack. This can be very useful for tight corridors where the player will be able to tell how many enemies are waiting ahead and where. However, this item does have a limited battery-life.

    - Night Vision Goggles
    On some levels of Zero Tolerance the distance of the map can appear misty and gray reducing vision into the distance. When a player picks up night vision goggles, this effect will be reduced. The view goes from full colour to green and black, and enemies can be seen more clearly at greater distances. However, this item has a limited battery life.

    - Torch
    Again, on some levels the distance of the map may appear dark and black. However, with the torch equipped the distance seen is increased, making it easier to spot enemies further away. However, this item does have a limited battery life.

    - Fire Extinguisher
    Areas on Zero Tolerance are sometimes blocked off by fire, when equipped the fire extinguisher can clear a path through the fire. Also note that when a player comes into contract with fire it will drain health regardless of whether or not the player has the Bullet-Proof Vest equipped.

    <desc>Cats, the leader of a band of swashbuckling space pirates, is terrorizing the galaxy. You must pilot the only remaining Milky Way attack craft into combat and stop Cats and his buccaneers!

Gameplay:

As with other scrolling shooters, the aim of the game is to shoot all enemies that appear on screen and avoid getting obliterated by lasers, crashing into enemies or into foreground scenery. There are mid-level and end-of-level boss enemies that stay with the player until they are defeated.

The player, a "ZIG" star fighter, has several ways to attack:

    - Using the main cannon: scatter-shot (red weapon), lasers (blue weapon), or homing missiles (green weapon). Similar to configuring the Vic Viper in Gradius

    - Ramming smaller enemies with the orbital cannons that appear above and below the ZIG. These cannons fire whatever weapon is equipped on the main ship at the time.

    - Grabbing an enemy using the tractor beam and releasing it at another enemy, similar to the Kirby games.

    - Releasing the spherical front shield once it is collected, like in R-Type.

Soon after starting, the player encounters power-up ships. If destroyed, they leave behind power-ups. These run in the sequence of red weapon, blue weapon, green weapon, and speed-up, and then start with red again. There is also an occasional shield power-up, which attaches to the front of the ship. Once the first weapon power-up is collected, two small ships appear above and below the ZIG, and follow its exact movements. These extra ships are impervious and can be used as shields. As they occasionally move nearer the ZIG when blocked by large enemies or foreground scenery, they can serve as a warning to the player that they should move carefully to avoid a collision.

Each of the three main weapons has three power levels. Each time the same weapon is collected, the power level increases. If a different weapon is collected, it starts back on level 1 power, unless level 3 power was already attained previously. If you have a spherical front shield while you're already holding one, a special power-up will replace it which increase all weapons to a special, otherwise unattainable, level 4. Another way to obtain level 4 is if you're already carrying a bomb and detonate an object that would yield another bomb power up. In the intro scenes, the ZIG's windows are green. In the game itself, the windows change color depending on what weapon the player has.

Trivia:

"All your base are belong to us"

In the Sega Mega Drive version, to expand on the game's plot, an introductory cut scene was added to the game. This introductory scene was translated to English from Japanese rather poorly for the European release, because of the European version being rushed,[citation needed] resulting in dialogue such as "Somebody set up us the bomb", "All your base are belong to us" (often shortened to "All Your Base", "AYBABTU", or simply "AYB"), and "You have no chance of survive make your time." The introduction does not appear in the arcade version.

In 1999, Zero Wing's introduction was re-discovered, culminating in the wildly popular "All your base are belong to us" memetic phenomenon. This also popularized the introductory and Level 3 background music by Tatsuya Uemura.[citation needed]

The console version of Zero Wing was never released in North America for the Turbo Grafx (PC Engine) or Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) due to the release of the arcade version distributed by Williams Electronics, which lacks the AYB intro. However, the European Mega Drive version of the game will play on American consoles due to a lack of region protection.

Hints:

- Alternative Endings -
There are three different endings depending on how many times you beat this game non-stop. No such thing as Expert Mode. Only Easy and Normal(Hard). Beat the game and your back at NATOLS, keep going for more endings.

Beat the Game Once - Worst Ending
Beat the Game Thrice - Best Ending
Beat the Game Twice - 2nd Best Ending

    <desc>In the game you are a male or female protagonist (Zeke or Julia), fighting the vampires, mummies, zombies, etc. on over 50 levels (not including secrets) and saving all of the people you find. There are defined number of neighbors you save on every level. When they are free then "Exit" door opens and you jump on next level.

The levels differ from mall and grocery store to beaches and football fields. Using different weapons such as bazooka or water gun you have to kill the bosses such as huge babies, dragons or ants at the end of levels. You can play the game with two players cooperatively

Gameplay:

The player chooses between two teenage characters, Zeke and Julie, or both in two-player mode. They navigate suburban neighborhoods, shopping malls, pyramids, and other areas, destroying a variety of horror-movie monsters, including vampires, werewolves, huge demonic babies, and the game's flagship, zombies. In each of the 48 stages (excluding the bonus levels) the goal is to rescue the surviving neighbors, at which point a magical door opens that will take the player to the next stage. However, if the player is not careful, any enemy in the game will kill the neighbors, preventing them from being saved. At least one neighbor must be saved from each level to progress to the next. The game is lost if all of the neighbors in a certain stage are killed or if the player(s) lose all of their lives. Scoring points earns players more neighbors to save (but only up to the maximum of 10) and extra lives.

Each level has a maximum of ten neighbors. If they all die without the player saving at least one throughout the stage, the game is over. The neighbors are saved by touching them. Each neighbor is worth a certain amount of points.

Trivia:

- In the Game -
The monsters in the game are based on horror movies made in the 1950s as well as more modern movies such as Friday the 13th or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. For example, the man with the chainsaw is based on Jason and Leatherface respectively. The weapons usefulness is also based on these depictions, such that werewolfs die in one attack if attacked with silverware, or vampires die faster if attacked with the crucifix. The crucifix is the most powerful weapon and Pandora's Box is the most powerful special item. In the SNES version of the game, there is a flame thrower which is not incuded in the uncensored Sega Megadrive version.

There is an extra level in which the character is permited to walk around Lucas Arts and talk to the staff responsible for the game.

- Censorship -
Due to the theme of the game, it was subject to some censorship. This game was released before the ESRB came along and before then, Nintendo did not want anything violent in their video games such as blood and gore. Nintendo of America itself ordered all depictions of red blood and gore be removed or changed to green ooze. Censorship committees at several European Nations, i.e. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany had the game renamed to just: 'Zombies' and ordered other changes, including making the chainsaw-wielding lunatics replaced with lumberjacks with axes.

    <name>Zool: Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension</name>

    <desc>Once every year, the games world is rocked by a game so stunning, so fast, so colorful, so big, so demanding, so mega, so awesome, so varied , so incredible, and so full of fabulous features and unexpected treats, that everybody just looks at it and says "THAT'S IT!" This year, ZOOL, THE NINJA FROM THE Nth DIMENSION, is definitely "IT!"

Gameplay:

Zool is a "Ninja Of The "Nth" Dimension" who is forced to land on Earth. In order to gain ninja ranking he has to pass six lands. Gremlin has asserted that the name "Zool" did not refer to the supernatural entity Zuul from the film Ghostbusters.

The game is a pure arcade platform game, relying on smooth, fast moving gameplay, colorful graphics and a popular soundtrack by Patrick Phelan which overlaps with the Lotus 3 soundtrack and has inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. The game also contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano.

Zool was also ported to the Atari ST, Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive, SNES, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Amiga CD32, PC, Acorn Archimedes and Jaguar. A Zool coin-op was released in 1993 to cash in on the hype surrounding the Amiga release, but was not well distributed and is now not widely remembered. Zool was also ported to the RISC OS platform.

Reviews for the Amiga version of the game were extremely positive, possibly partly because the need was felt for the Amiga to have a flagship game to rival Sonic. However some criticism was aimed at the blatant and pervasive product placement in the game for lollipop company Chupa Chups, in the first three levels (known as 'Sweet Zone'). Another frequent criticism of the game was that it was excessively difficult. Some contemporary reviewers complained of not being able to get further than the second level (Music Zone).

    <desc>Did you ever get punched by a banana? Tussle with a mushroom? Tumble into a black hole? You will now! ZOOM into space and race around the play grids, out-running the funny critters who pop up in the strangest places!

Gameplay:

The game has 6 stages with 6 levels in each stage. The levels feature a board with gridlines on it that the player walks on. The lines are painted as the player walks on them. If the player paints all four edges of a square in the grid, the square flashes indicating it has been filled. All the squares must be filled to complete the level.

The player controls a character named Zoomer, who is constantly moving. Various monsters will appear in the levels. Some chase the player while others do other things such as erasing the lines the player has filled. Zoomer can shoot a ball from the back which can knock monsters backwards upon being struck by it.

Several items appear randomly in levels. Some of which simply add points while others may slow down monsters, render the player invincible, or even instantly clear the level.

    <desc>WHY ARE YOU WASTING TIME READING THE BOX WHEN YOU COULD BE PLAYING THE GAME?! Right here inside this little box is the excitement you crave, the challenge you need. Level after level of brain-burning action coming at you from all sides, faster and faster until your thumbs are numb, your eyes are aching and your mind is molten. And there's only ONE thing you know... "I can't stop playing this game!"

Gameplay:

The player controls a triangle in the center of the screen. Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant, and runs of consecutive identical pieces on one row are longer than one might think statistically.

If a piece falls into the center square, the game is over.

If the player shoots a piece of the same color as their triangle, it will be "zooped" (cleared) and points are earned. If the piece behind the target piece is also of the same color, it is also "zooped." The same goes for the next piece, and so on. In the example Image:Zoop genesis.jpg, shooting to the left of the position in the screenshot will "zoop" the green pieces and return the player to the center, facing right (the opposite direction).

If a piece of a different color than the player's current piece is shot, the player's piece will switch colors with it. This is also what happens when a piece of a different color is encountered after zooping one or more pieces of the same color. In the example, shooting down would bounce off the orange piece (leaving a green piece behind), and return with the orange piece.

When the quota of "zooped" pieces is met, the game speeds up and (before level 10) the background changes.

Various special pieces do different things:

    - A proximity bomb (shaped like a lightning bolt) blows up pieces in a 3-3 area centered at the target piece.

    - A line bomb (often shaped like a gear) clears a whole target line of pieces.

    - A color bomb (often shaped like a paint splotch) clears all the pieces in a quadrant that match the target piece.

    - Collect five spring pieces to clear the whole screen.

    - If a piece is pushed right next to the center square, it immediately disappears. In this way, the player may not lose because of a powerup entering the middle square.

- Points -
Generally speaking, every cleared piece is worth 100 points. In the case of zooping more than one piece at once, each piece is worth 100 points more than the piece before it. For example, zooping 3 pieces results in 100 + 200 + 300 = 600 points. In addition, if a row is full (one more piece being added will cause a loss of game) and all the pieces are of the same color, zooping the row earns a bonus of 5,000 points for the smaller rows on the top and bottom, and 10,000 for the rows on the left and right. All pieces cleared as a result of any of the four powerup items are worth 100 points.

- Opti-Challenge -
To make matters even more difficult, the game also employed what was referred to as "opti-challenge" backgrounds. As the game progressed, the backgrounds would become increasingly distracting. Early on, this would involve the use of contrasting colours, and increasingly intricate colour schemes. Background patterns would also become more intricate and would make subtle use of asymmetrical elements. Ultimately, the background on level 9 employed black and white tiles, roughly the size of the invading pieces, while the center square contained a picture of clouds, which expanded to fill the screen on levels 10 and later. Although the opti-challenge element of the game was used as a selling point, very little information exists about the technique itself, and no other game on the market has ever openly claimed to use opti-challenge graphics.

- Sound and music -
The MS-DOS version of the game supports various sound cards, and features wavetable-like MIDI music. The sound effects have a cartoonish tone to match the vivid colors used through the stages. The music is basically jazz, and "evolves" with the game. The title and options screens, and the first stages, feature "smooth jazz" tunes. As the levels get harder, the music gets more and more tense, adding to the fast-paced atmosphere of the game.
